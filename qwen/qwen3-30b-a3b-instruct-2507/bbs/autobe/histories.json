The mission is to provide an accessible, respectful, and intellectually stimulating space for diverse perspectives to be shared and debated.\n\n### Target Market and Users\nThe primary users are intellectually curious individuals aged 18-45 who are interested in current events, economic trends, and political discourse. This includes students, professionals in policy-related fields, economists, political scientists, and engaged citizens who want to participate in thoughtful discussions about society's major challenges.\n\n### Core Value Proposition\nThe platform provides a structured space for economic and political discussion that prioritizes civil discourse, evidence-based arguments, and quality content. Unlike many social media platforms that prioritize engagement over substance, this discussion board emphasizes thoughtful contributions and respectful dialogue.\n\n### Differentiating Factors\n- Focus on substantive discussions rather than viral content\n- Moderated environment to prevent harassment and misinformation\n- Clear hierarchy of user permissions based on contribution quality\n- Simple interface designed for text-based discourse\n- Emphasis on recent economic and political topics\n\n### Long-term Goals\n- Establish a trusted community of informed discussion participants\n- Build a repository of high-quality discussion transcripts on current events\n- Develop a reputation for balanced, civil discourse on sensitive topics\n- Expand to include expert guest contributions and structured debate formats\n- Create a sustainable platform that balances accessibility with quality control\n\n### Service Boundaries\nThe platform will focus exclusively on economic and political topics, excluding other areas such as entertainment, sports, or personal relationships. The system will not host multimedia content beyond simple images. The board will not support real-time chat features or instant messaging functionality.\n\n## User Roles and Permissions\n\n### Guest Users\nGuests are unauthenticated users who can browse content but cannot participate in discussions. They are the default role for visitors who haven't registered yet.\n\n### Member Users\nMembers are authenticated users who have created an account and verified their email address. They can create new discussion threads, reply to existing posts, upvote/downvote content, and report inappropriate material.

They can review reported content, approve/reject new threads, edit or remove posts, and manage user behavior. Moderators are appointed by administrators and are expected to enforce community guidelines consistently and fairly.\n\n### Authentication and Authorization Hierarchy\n- Guest: Cannot create posts or replies\n- Member: Can create and reply but cannot moderate content\n- Moderator: Can view and manage all content and user activities\n- The system enforces a strict hierarchy where each role inherits permissions from lower roles but cannot perform actions reserved for higher roles\n\n### Access Control Rules\n- Any user attempting to access restricted content will be denied access with an appropriate message\n- Role-based permissions are enforced at the system level for all operations\n- Changes to user roles require administrative approval and proper audit logging\n- All authorization

THE system SHALL send a verification email to the new address.\nWHEN the new email is verified, THE system SHALL update the user's email address and notify them of the change.\n\n## Business Requirements in Natural Language\n\nThe discussion board operates on the principle that civil discourse is essential for democratic societies. The system must balance openness with the need for quality content. Community health is paramount, and moderation should preserve a respectful environment where diverse viewpoints can be expressed without harassment.\n\nAll users must understand that their contributions are public and can be viewed by anyone. While anonymity is not required, users are encouraged to use consistent identifiers to build credibility over time. The platform's value lies not just in the quantity of discussions but in the quality and depth of arguments presented.\n\nThe system must prevent abuse while maintaining accessibility. This means protecting users from harassment and misinformation while ensuring that legitimate dissent and challenging viewpoints are not silenced. The approach to content moderation should be transparent, consistent, and proportionate.\n\nEconomic and political topics are complex and often emotionally charged. The system must accommodate this complexity by allowing for nuanced discussion while preventing toxic behavior. The goal is not to resolve disputes but to facilitate understanding of different perspectives.\n\nThe platform should reward constructive contributions through upvoting and visible participation, helping to identify valuable content and active members. Over time, this should create a virtuous cycle where high-quality contributions receive visibility, encouraging more thoughtful participation.\n\nWe expect members to understand that their participation shapes the community's culture. This includes respecting different viewpoints, avoiding personal attacks, and engaging with evidence rather than emotion. The system should reflect these values through its technical implementation and operational policies.\n\n## User Scenarios and Use Cases\n\n### Guest User Journey: Browsing Content\n1.

Our mission is to create a space where individuals from diverse backgrounds can exchange well-reasoned perspectives, learn from different viewpoints, and contribute to informed civic discourse.\n\nThe platform aims to democratize access to high-quality economic and political discussion, making thoughtful debate accessible to anyone with an internet connection. By focusing on quality over quantity and substance over sensationalism, we strive to become a trusted resource for informed discussion in an era of information overload and polarized discourse.\n\n## Target Market and Users\n\n### Primary User Personas\n\n- **General Public**: Citizens interested in understanding complex economic and political issues, including informed voters, students, educators, and professionals from various fields who want to stay informed about national and global developments.\n- **Policy Enthusiasts**: Individuals with specialized interest in economics, political science, public policy, and governance who seek in-depth analysis and discussion of current events.\n- **Academics and Researchers**: Professors, graduate students, and scholars in social sciences who want to share research findings, discuss theoretical models, and engage with practical policy applications.\n- **Journalists and Media Professionals**: Reporters and commentators who use the platform as a source of diverse perspectives and public sentiment analysis.\n\n### Behavioral Characteristics\n\n- **Information Seekers**: Users who primarily read posts to understand different viewpoints on complex issues\n- **Contribution Makers**: Users who actively create discussion threads and contribute thoughtful responses\n- **Moderate Discerners**: Users who carefully evaluate multiple perspectives before forming opinions\n- **Passive Observers**: Users who frequently browse content but may not actively participate\n- **Constructive Critics**: Users who engage in debate with the goal of improving understanding rather than winning arguments\n\n## Core Value Proposition\n\nThe Economic/Political Discussion Board delivers unique value through four key pillars:\n\n1. **High-Quality Discussion Environment**\n   - Features an intention-focused interface that prioritizes meaningful conversation over attention-grabbing content\n   - Implements intelligent moderation to foster respectful discourse\n   - Encourages evidence-based arguments with a focus on sources and reasoning\n\n2. **Navigable Complexity**\n   - Organizes discussions through intuitive categorization of economic and political topics\n   - Provides cross-references between related discussions to help users understand connections between issues\n   - Offers curated expert insights and recommended reading to supplement conversation\n\n3. **Diverse Perspective Access**\n   - Actively recruits contributors from a wide range of demographic, geographical, and ideological backgrounds\n   - Implements systems to prevent echo chambers and algorithmic bias\n   - Encourages exposure to viewpoints different from one's own\n\n4. **Knowledge Amplification**\n   - Creates a searchable archive of discussion threads that serves as a public knowledge repository\n   - Enables users to build on existing conversations rather than reinventing the wheel\n   - Provides metrics to help users identify the most informative and well-reasoned contributions\n\n## Unique Differentiators\n\n### 1. Focused Discussion Framework\nWHEN a user creates a new thread, THE system SHALL require that the post include a clear thesis statement and specific discussion questions, meaning the post must establish what the discussion is about and what specific aspects should be explored. IF a thread lacks a clear thesis, THEN THE system SHALL prevent publication until the user adds necessary clarification.\n\n### 2. Impact-Based Moderation System\nWHILE a user is composing a post, THE system SHALL analyze the language for emotional tone, inflammatory phrasing, and logical fallacies. IF the system detects high-risk language, THEN THE system SHALL prompt the user with specific suggestions for revision and show an estimated impact score for the piece.\n\n### 3. Perspective Diversity Metrics\nWHEN a user views a discussion thread, THE system SHALL display a dashboard showing the ideological distribution of contributors, the geographic diversity of perspectives, and the range of professional backgrounds represented. IF a thread lacks perspective diversity, THEN THE system SHALL recommend related discussions with complementary viewpoints.\n\n### 4. Fact-Checking Integration\nWHEN a user claims a specific fact in a discussion, THE system SHALL provide one-click access to verify the claim against reputable sources. IF the system detects a fact that contradicts verifiable evidence, THEN THE system SHALL highlight the discrepancy and suggest corrections.\n\n### 5. Contribution Evaluation System\nWHEN a user participates in a discussion, THE system SHALL track contribution quality metrics including argument coherence, use of evidence, citation accuracy, and respect for opposing viewpoints. IF a user consistently demonstrates high-quality contribution patterns, THEN THE system SHALL award reputation points and display them in the user profile.\n\n## Long-term Goals\n\n### Strategic Objectives (3-5 Years)\n\n1. **Become the Preeminent Platform for Informed Discussion**\n   - Achieve 1 million active monthly users with at least 500,000 monthly discussions\n   - Establish partnerships with universities, research institutes, and think tanks\n   - Become a reference point for journalists and policymakers seeking diverse perspectives\n\n2. **Build a Sustainable Ecosystem**\n   - Develop multiple revenue streams including premium features, institutional subscriptions, and research partnerships\n   - Achieve financial self-sufficiency while maintaining platform independence\n   - Establish a governance structure with independent oversight\n\n3. **Advance the State of Public Discourse**\n   - Create metrics and tools that can be adopted by other platforms to improve discussion quality\n   - Publish research studies on effective moderation techniques and argument quality indicators\n   - Host annual conferences on improving civic discourse\n\n### Innovation Vision (5-10 Years)\n\n1. **Develop Adaptive Discussion Intelligence**\n   - Create AI systems that can detect emerging consensus patterns across discussions\n   - Build tools that help users identify when their arguments are becoming repetitive or circular\n   - Implement dynamic suggesters that can propose additional discussion angles based on the conversation flow\n\n2. **Create Global Policy Simulation Lab**\n   - Establish a feature that allows users to collaboratively simulate policy implementations\n   - Develop models that predict potential economic and social impacts of proposed policies\n   - Use the platform to crowdsource public sentiment analysis on proposed legislation\n\n3. **Establish Digital Civic Education Initiative**\n   - Create certification programs for high-quality discussion participation\n   - Develop educational content that teaches critical thinking and argumentation skills\n   - Partner with schools and community organizations to integrate the platform into civic education\n\n## Service Boundaries\n\n### What the Platform Will Provide\n\n- A forum for discussing economic and political issues at national and international levels\n- Tools for creating, organizing, and navigating complex discussions\n- Systems for ensuring respectful and evidence-based discourse\n- Features for measuring contribution quality and perspective diversity\n- Mechanisms for ensuring factual accuracy of claims\n\n### What the Platform Will Not Provide\n\n- Real-time news updates or breaking news coverage\n- Personal information about users beyond what is necessary for account management\n- Financial advice or investment recommendations\n- Legal counsel or guidance on specific legal matters\n- Support for political campaigns or advocacy groups\n- Real-time polling or voting on policy questions\n- For-profit advertising or sponsored content\n- Social networking features beyond discussion and user profiles\n- Voice or video discussion capabilities\n\n### Excluded Domains\n\nThe platform will focus exclusively on economic and political discussion, and will not cover:\n\n- Entertainment industry commentary\n- Sports-related discussions\n- Personal relationships and socializing\n- Health and medical advice\n- Religious debates (except when discussing religious influence on public policy)\n- Consumer product reviews\n- Travel experiences\n- Personal career advice\n- Academic research in non-social science fields\n\nWhile these domains may be tangentially related to economic or political issues, they will not be the primary focus of the discussion board.

Despite the proliferation of social media platforms, most fail to provide a space for thoughtful, evidence-based debate on complex socio-economic issues. Many existing forums suffer from:\n\n- Overwhelming noise with low signal-to-noise ratio\n- Dominance of partisan rhetoric over substantive discussion\n- Lack of moderation that preserves constructive dialogue\n- No mechanisms to reward quality contributions\n- Inadequate safeguards against misinformation\n\nThis service fills this gap by creating a dedicated space where users can engage in respectful, well-informed discussions about economic policies, political systems, and social issues.

Guests have read-only access to all publicly available content and are subject to specific restrictions on content creation and system interactions.\n\n### Member\n\nThe member role represents authenticated users who can actively participate in discussions. Members have the ability to create new threads, reply to existing posts, upvote or downvote content, report inappropriate material, and manage their user profiles. Members are required to complete email verification before gaining full participation privileges.\n\n### Moderator\n\nThe moderator role represents authorized users with elevated permissions for content oversight and community management. Moderators can review reported content, approve or reject new discussion threads, edit or delete inappropriate content, ban users from the system, and deliver warnings to users violating community guidelines. Moderators operate under a strict authorization model with additional verification requirements.\n\n## Authentication Requirements\n\n### Core Authentication Functions\n\nTHE system SHALL implement a comprehensive authentication framework supporting the following operations:\n\n- Users can register with a unique email address and password\n- Users can log in using their credentials to access their account\n- Users can log out to terminate their active session\n- System maintains user sessions securely\n- Users can verify their email address through a confirmation link\n- Users can reset forgotten passwords through an email-based recovery process\n- Users can change their password with proper authentication verification\n- Users can revoke access from all devices\n\n### Password Policy\n\nWHEN a user attempts to create a password, THE system SHALL enforce the following requirements:\n\n- Passwords MUST be at least 8 characters long\n- Passwords MUST contain at least one uppercase letter\n- Passwords MUST contain at least one lowercase letter\n- Passwords MUST contain at least one digit\n- Passwords MUST contain at least one special character from: !@#$%^&*()\n- Passwords CANNOT contain spaces\n- Passwords CANNOT be the same as the username\n- Passwords CANNOT be on a list of common and easily guessed passwords\n\n### Email Verification\n\nWHEN a new user completes registration, THE system SHALL send a verification email with a unique, time-limited link. IF the user does not click the verification link within 24 hours, THE system SHALL automatically delete the unverified account and remove all related data. USERS SHALL NOT be able to log in until their email address is verified.\n\n### Login Attempt Limits\n\nWHEN a user attempts to log in and receives invalid credentials, THE system SHALL track failed attempts. IF five consecutive failed login attempts occur from the same IP address within a 15-minute period, THE system SHALL temporarily block all further attempts from that IP address for one hour. THE system SHALL send a notification email to the user when their account is temporarily locked due to excessive failed attempts.\n\n## Role-Based Permissions Matrix\n\n| Permission | Guest | Member | Moderator |\n|------------|-------|--------|-----------|\n| View discussion threads | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Create new discussion threads | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Reply to existing threads | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Edit own posts | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Delete own posts | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Upvote posts | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Downvote posts | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Report inappropriate content | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Access user profile | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Edit user profile | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Promote content to featured | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Approve new discussion threads | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Remove inappropriate content | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Ban users from platform | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Send warnings to users | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |\n| View user activity logs | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Access system configuration | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n\n## Session Management\n\n### Session Creation\n\nWHEN a user successfully authenticates with valid credentials, THE system SHALL create a user session. THE system SHALL generate a unique session identifier and store it in the session store with a timestamp indicating creation time. THE system SHALL associate the session with the user's account information and set the session expiration time to 30 days from creation.\n\n### Session Renewal\n\nWHILE a user is actively using the system, THE system SHALL automatically renew the session upon each authenticated request. THE system SHALL update the session's timestamp to the current time when any authenticated request is received. THE system SHALL extend the session expiration time by 30 days from the renewal timestamp.\n\n### Session Revocation\n\nIF a user explicitly requests to log out from all devices, THE system SHALL invalidate all active sessions associated with that user account. THE system SHALL remove all session identifiers from the session store and mark the sessions as terminated. THE system SHALL issue a notification to the user confirming the successful logout.\n\n### Automated Session Expiration\n\nWHILE a user session is active, THE system SHALL verify the session's validity on each request. IF a session has not been renewed within the last 30 days, THE system SHALL automatically terminate the session and invalidate all related session identifiers. THE system SHALL return an error response with code 401 (Unauthorized) and message \"Session has expired\" to any request attempting to use an expired session.\n\n### Session Lifetime\n\nTHE session SHALL automatically expire after 30 days of inactivity. THE session SHALL be considered active only when a request is made with a valid session identifier. IF no active activity occurs for 30 consecutive days, THE system SHALL automatically terminate the session and remove all associated data from the session store.\n\n## JWT Token Structure\n\n### Token Generation\n\nWHEN a user successfully authenticates, THE system SHALL generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the following claims:\n\n- `userId`: The unique identifier for the authenticated user\n- `role`: The user's role (guest, member, or moderator)\n- `permissions`: An array of permissions granted to the user based on their role\n- `iat`: The timestamp of token issuance (ISO 8601 format)\n- `exp`: The timestamp of token expiration (15 minutes after issuance)\n- `jti`: A unique identifier for the token\n\n### Token Payload Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": \"user-12345\",\n  \"role\": \"member\",\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"create_thread\",\n    \"reply_to_thread\",\n    \"upvote_content\",\n    \"downvote_content\",\n    \"report_content\",\n    \"edit_own_post\",\n    \"delete_own_post\"\n  ],\n  \"iat\": 1709213400,\n  \"exp\": 1709213460,\n  \"jti\": \"token-abc123\"\n}\n```\n\n### Token Expiration\n\nTHE access token SHALL expire 15 minutes after issuance. WHEN a request contains an expired token, THE system SHALL respond with HTTP status code 401 (Unauthorized) and challenge the user to re-authenticate. THE system SHALL generate a new token upon successful re-authentication.\n\n### Token Refresh\n\nTHE system SHALL provide a refresh token with each authentication that expires after 30 days of inactivity. WHEN a user makes an authenticated request with an expiring access token and a valid refresh token, THE system SHALL generate a new access token with a new expiration time of 15 minutes from issuance. IF the refresh token is expired or invalid, THE system SHALL return an error response requiring the user to re-authenticate.\n\n### Token Storage and Security\n\nTHE system SHALL store access tokens in the browser's local storage for convenience. THE system SHALL store refresh tokens in an httpOnly cookie to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. THE system SHALL implement secure transmission of tokens using HTTPS and prevent token leakage through logging mechanisms.\n\n## Access Control Rules\n\n### Role Hierarchy Enforcement\n\nTHE role hierarchy SHALL enforce that a user with a lower role cannot perform actions authorized to higher roles. IF a user attempts to perform an action requiring a higher role than their current role, THE system SHALL deny the request and return HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden) with message \"Insufficient permissions\"\n\n### Transaction-Level Access Control\n\nWHEN a user attempts to modify content, THE system SHALL verify both the user's role and the relationship to the content. IF a member attempts to edit a post created by another member, THE system SHALL deny the request and return HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden) with message \"Cannot edit content created by another user\". IF a user attempts to delete a post they did not create, THE system SHALL deny the request and return HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden) with message \"Cannot delete content created by another user\".\n\n### Cross-Role Interaction Rules\n\nWHILE a reviewer is working in the system, THE system SHALL enforce that moderators cannot assign roles to other users based only on their own authority. IF a moderator attempts to grant another user moderator privileges without reviewing the user's application materials, THE system SHALL deny the request and return HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden) with message \"Role assignment requires review and approval process\".\n\n### Data Exposure Control\n\nTHE system SHALL implement fine-grained access control for sensitive information. IF a guest attempts to access a user profile, THE system SHALL return only the username and registration date, omitting any sensitive information such as email address, password hash, and session data. IF a member attempts to access another member's profile, THE system SHALL return only publicly available information.\n\n### Audit Trail Requirements\n\nWHILE a user performs privileged actions, THE system SHALL create an automatic audit trail. IF a moderator approves a new discussion thread, THE system SHALL log the action with the following information:\n\n- Timestamp of action (ISO 8601 format)\n- User ID of the moderator\n- Action performed (approval/rejection)\n- Thread ID being modified\n- Reason for action (if applicable)\n- System IP address where the action occurred\n\nTHE system SHALL ensure that audit trail data cannot be modified after creation and is stored in a separate, protected database table.\n\n### Hybrid Access Control\n\nIF a user attempts to perform an action that requires both membership and moderation privileges, THE system SHALL enforce that the user must have full moderator status to perform the action. IF a member attempts to perform an action requiring moderator privileges, THE system SHALL deny the request and return HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden) with message \"Moderator privileges required for this operation\".\n\n### Session Validation\n\nWHEN a request contains a JWT token, THE system SHALL validate the token's integrity and expiration. IF the token is malformed, expired, or has been revoked, THE system SHALL return HTTP status code 401 (Unauthorized) with message \"Invalid or expired authentication token\". THE system SHALL not proceed with the requested operation when authentication validation fails.\n\n# IMPLEMENTATION NOTE\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

Service Overview and Vision\n\n### Service Vision and Mission\n\nThe economic/political discussion board exists to create a focused, thoughtful space for citizens to engage in meaningful conversations about economic policies, political issues, and societal challenges. Our mission is to foster informed discourse by providing a platform where diverse perspectives can be shared, debated, and evaluated through structured discussion rather than emotional reaction.\n\nThe board serves as a digital town hall where individuals from different backgrounds can exchange ideas about government policies, economic systems, social justice, environmental regulations, and global affairs. By organizing discussions around specific topics and moderating content quality, we aim to elevate the conversation beyond superficial debates to substantive analysis and constructive dialogue.\n\n### Target Market and Users\n\nOur primary users are citizens passionate about social and political issues, including students, educators, professionals in public policy, activists, journalists, and concerned community members. The platform targets individuals aged 16-65 who want to participate in informed discussions about economic systems, political parties, governmental regulations, and societal changes.\n\nThe service is designed specifically for individuals who value reasoned debate and evidence-based discussion over opinion polarization. It appeals to users frustrated by the emotional, performative nature of social media debates and seeks to recapture the integrity of thoughtful public discourse.\n\n### Core Value Proposition\n\nThe economic/political discussion board offers three primary value propositions:\n\n1. **Structured Discussion Environment**: Unlike open social media platforms, our board provides a curated space with clear rules for participation, ensuring discussions remain productive and focused on the topic at hand.\n\n2. **Content Quality Focus**: By implementing a reputation-based voting system and moderation framework, the board elevates well-reasoned, evidence-supported arguments while reducing the impact of misinformation and emotional appeals.\n\n3. **Topic-Specific Forums**: The platform organizes discussions around clearly defined topics such as \"Universal Basic Income,\" \"Climate Change Policy,\" \"Healthcare Reform,\" \"Taxation Systems,\" and \"International Relations,\" allowing users to find and engage with content directly relevant to their interests.\n\n### Unique Differentiators\n\nWhat sets our discussion board apart from other platforms:\n\n- **Minimum 100-word posts requirement**: This criterion ensures that contributions are substantive, not superficial comments or emotional reactions. Users must demonstrate thoughtful analysis to participate.\n\n- **Reviewer validation system**: New threads cannot be posted without being reviewed by a moderator before becoming publicly visible. This prevents misleading information and maintains content quality.\n\n- **Color-coded reputation system**: Users' contributions are visually represented through different colors based on their reputation level, with higher reputation users having their arguments displayed more prominently.\n\n- **Topic certification system**: We certify that certain topics are properly vetted before being added to the board, ensuring they represent legitimate, important issues rather than fringe or hypothetical concepts.\n\n### Long-term Goals\n\nOur long-term vision for the economic/political discussion board is to become the premier global platform for civic engagement and informed public discourse. Over the next five years, we aim to:\n\n- Expand our user base to reach 500,000 active participants across 20 countries\n- Develop partnerships with universities, research institutions, and civic organizations to enhance content quality\n- Implement AI-assisted analysis tools that help users identify logical fallacies and evidence gaps in arguments\n- Establish a certification program for high-quality contributors to promote academic rigor\n- Create localized versions of the board in multiple languages to ensure global accessibility\n\n## 2. Business Model and Justification\n\n### Why This Service Exists\n\nModern democracy requires informed citizen participation, yet online discourse has become increasingly polarized, emotionally charged, and dominated by misinformation. Traditional social media platforms often amplify sensational content and suppress nuanced discussion through algorithmic curation.\n\nThe economic/political discussion board fills a critical gap by providing a platform specifically designed to promote substantive, evidence-based conversation about societal issues. Unlike general-purpose social networks, our service is intentionally structured to elevate quality over quantity, reason over emotion, and depth over brevity.\n\nThis service exists because existing platforms fail to address the core need for thoughtful civic engagement. Users seek a space where they can express views without being subjected to harassment, where debates are anchored in facts rather than ideology, and where complex issues can be discussed with the depth they deserve.\n\n### Revenue Strategy\n\nThe service will generate revenue through a tiered subscription model with three distinct levels:\n\n1. **Basic Free Tier**: Includes access to all public discussions, basic posting capabilities, and standard content discovery features. This tier will serve primarily as a user acquisition channel and content showcase.\n\n2. **Premium Tier ($4.99/month)**: Adds enhanced features including the ability to create private discussion groups, priority moderation response time (within 2 business hours), advanced search filters, and home page customization options. This tier targets engaged users who want to contribute more meaningfully to the community.\n\n3. **Pro Tier ($9.99/month)**: Includes all premium features plus additional capabilities such as creating public forums (with content certification), enhanced analytics for understanding discussion trends, and access to exclusive expert-led webinars on economic and political topics.\n\nIn addition to subscriptions, we will implement a targeted advertising strategy for non-intrusive, contextually relevant content. Advertisements will be limited to premium content recommendations, educational resources, and partner events that align with our mission of informed civic discourse.\n\n### User Acquisition and Retention\n\nOur user acquisition strategy will rely on a multi-channel approach:\n\n- **Partnerships with educational institutions**: Collaborating with universities and colleges to integrate the discussion board into civic education curricula\n- **Content marketing**: Creating high-quality blog posts, podcasts, and webinars discussing current political and economic issues\n- **Social media community building**: Establishing presence on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to share thought leadership content\n- **Referral program**: Offering premium features for users who successfully refer friends to join the platform\n- **Press outreach**: Building relationships with journalists and analysts who cover political and economic issues\n\nFor user retention, we will focus on:\n\n- **Gamification through reputation system**: Users earn reputation points based on the quality and impact of their contributions, encouraging sustained participation\n- **Personalized content discovery**: The system learns users' interests and preferences to recommend relevant discussions\n- **Weekly challenge cycles**: Periodic theme-based discussions that encourage participation on timely topics\n- **Achievement badges**: Recognizing users for milestones like posting 100 quality contributions or moderating successfully\n\n### Monetization Timeline\n\n- **Months 1-6**: Focus on user acquisition through free tier, content marketing, and partnerships. Establish core features and community guidelines.\n\n- **Months 7-12**: Introduce premium subscription tier with basic enhancements. Launch referral program. Begin A/B testing of advertising strategies.\n\n- **Month 13-18**: Launch Pro tier with advanced features. Establish partnerships with academic institutions. Implement reputation system.\n\n- **Month 19-24**: Expand into international markets. Implement AI-assisted analysis tools. Develop certification program for topics and contributors.\n\n### Success Metrics and KPIs\n\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) will be tracked monthly to measure success:\n\n- **User Engagement**: Average session duration (target: 12 minutes), daily active users (DAU), monthly active users (MAU)\n- **Content Quality**: Average post length (target: 250+ words), percentage of posts with at least 3 supporting references, average number of replies per thread\n- **Monetization**: Subscription conversion rate, average revenue per user (ARPU), churn rate (target: <8% monthly)\n- **Community Health**: Percentage of flagged content requiring moderator review, average time to first moderation response, user satisfaction score (target: 4.5/5)\n- **Growth**: User acquisition cost (target: < $15), referral rate, viral coefficient\n\n## 3.

The thread receives numerous upvotes from high-reputation users. The user's reputation score increases, and they receive a notification that their contribution has been featured in the \"Top Quality Posts\" section.\n\nThe user then engages in a constructive dialogue with others, building on their original argument with new data. A moderator recognizes the quality of the discussion and requests the user to contribute to a follow-up topic. This leads to increased visibility and network growth within the community.\n\n#### The Informed Participant\n\nA user discovers a thread about climate change policy development. They read multiple perspectives, including contrasting economic analyses from experts on both sides. The user posts a detailed reply identifying logical fallacies in one argument and citing peer-reviewed studies to support their position.\n\nOther users respond with additional references, and the discussion evolves into a comprehensive analysis of the policy's economic implications. The user receives positive feedback from the community, which boosts their reputation and encourages further participation.\n\n#### The Builder of Constructive Dialogue\n\nA user identifies a polarized discussion that has become heated. They create a new thread offering a framework for respectful dialogue on the topic. The thread includes guidelines for evidence-based discussion and civility requirements.\n\nThe moderator approves the thread and promotes it to the \"Best Practices\" section. The community adopts the guidelines, transforming the discourse from adversarial to collaborative. The user receives recognition from the moderation team and gains additional reputation points for their constructive contribution.\n\n### Step-by-Step User Flows\n\n#### Creating a New Thread (Member)\n\n1.
