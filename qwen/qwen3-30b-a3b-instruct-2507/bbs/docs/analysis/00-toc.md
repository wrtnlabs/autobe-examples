# Requirements Analysis Report for Economic/Political Discussion Board

## Service Overview

### Vision and Mission
The vision of the economic/political discussion board is to create a platform where users can engage in meaningful conversations about current events, economic policies, and political developments in a structured and moderated environment. The mission is to provide an accessible, respectful, and intellectually stimulating space for diverse perspectives to be shared and debated.

### Target Market and Users
The primary users are intellectually curious individuals aged 18-45 who are interested in current events, economic trends, and political discourse. This includes students, professionals in policy-related fields, economists, political scientists, and engaged citizens who want to participate in thoughtful discussions about society's major challenges.

### Core Value Proposition
The platform provides a structured space for economic and political discussion that prioritizes civil discourse, evidence-based arguments, and quality content. Unlike many social media platforms that prioritize engagement over substance, this discussion board emphasizes thoughtful contributions and respectful dialogue.

### Differentiating Factors
- Focus on substantive discussions rather than viral content
- Moderated environment to prevent harassment and misinformation
- Clear hierarchy of user permissions based on contribution quality
- Simple interface designed for text-based discourse
- Emphasis on recent economic and political topics

### Long-term Goals
- Establish a trusted community of informed discussion participants
- Build a repository of high-quality discussion transcripts on current events
- Develop a reputation for balanced, civil discourse on sensitive topics
- Expand to include expert guest contributions and structured debate formats
- Create a sustainable platform that balances accessibility with quality control

### Service Boundaries
The platform will focus exclusively on economic and political topics, excluding other areas such as entertainment, sports, or personal relationships. The system will not host multimedia content beyond simple images. The board will not support real-time chat features or instant messaging functionality.

## User Roles and Permissions

### Guest Users
Guests are unauthenticated users who can browse content but cannot participate in discussions. They are the default role for visitors who haven't registered yet.

### Member Users
Members are authenticated users who have created an account and verified their email address. They can create new discussion threads, reply to existing posts, upvote/downvote content, and report inappropriate material. Members are expected to contribute meaningfully to discussions and adhere to community guidelines.

### Moderator Users
Moderators are privileged users with additional permissions to maintain community standards. They can review reported content, approve/reject new threads, edit or remove posts, and manage user behavior. Moderators are appointed by administrators and are expected to enforce community guidelines consistently and fairly.

### Authentication and Authorization Hierarchy
- Guest: Cannot create posts or replies
- Member: Can create and reply but cannot moderate content
- Moderator: Can view and manage all content and user activities
- The system enforces a strict hierarchy where each role inherits permissions from lower roles but cannot perform actions reserved for higher roles

### Access Control Rules
- Any user attempting to access restricted content will be denied access with an appropriate message
- Role-based permissions are enforced at the system level for all operations
- Changes to user roles require administrative approval and proper audit logging
- All authorization checks occur before performing any action on content

## Business Requirements in Natural Language

The discussion board operates on the principle that civil discourse is essential for democratic societies. The system must balance openness with the need for quality content. Community health is paramount, and moderation should preserve a respectful environment where diverse viewpoints can be expressed without harassment.

All users must understand that their contributions are public and can be viewed by anyone. While anonymity is not required, users are encouraged to use consistent identifiers to build credibility over time. The platform's value lies not just in the quantity of discussions but in the quality and depth of arguments presented.

The system must prevent abuse while maintaining accessibility. This means protecting users from harassment and misinformation while ensuring that legitimate dissent and challenging viewpoints are not silenced. The approach to content moderation should be transparent, consistent, and proportionate.

Economic and political topics are complex and often emotionally charged. The system must accommodate this complexity by allowing for nuanced discussion while preventing toxic behavior. The goal is not to resolve disputes but to facilitate understanding of different perspectives.

The platform should reward constructive contributions through upvoting and visible participation, helping to identify valuable content and active members. Over time, this should create a virtuous cycle where high-quality contributions receive visibility, encouraging more thoughtful participation.

We expect members to understand that their participation shapes the community's culture. This includes respecting different viewpoints, avoiding personal attacks, and engaging with evidence rather than emotion. The system should reflect these values through its technical implementation and operational policies.
