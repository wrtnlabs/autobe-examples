# Future Roadmap: Economic/Political Discussion Board

This document outlines the planned evolution of the economic/political discussion board over the next several years. The roadmap is designed to strategically expand the platform's capabilities while maintaining its core simplicity and focus on meaningful conversations about economic and political topics.

## Short-term Roadmap (0-6 months)

The immediate priority is to establish a stable, functional foundation for the discussion board and implement key features that support basic community engagement and content management.

- THE system SHALL implement automated monitoring and alerting for system performance to ensure reliability and availability
- THE system SHALL document all known issues and technical debt in the project management system with clear priority ratings

### Basic Feature Implementation
- WHEN a member creates a new thread, THE system SHALL automatically assign a unique thread ID in the format Q{YYYY}{MM}{DD}-{NNNN} where NNNN is a sequential number
- THE system SHALL implement a simple tag system allowing users to categorize threads using up to 5 predefined tags (economics, politics, global affairs, social issues, technology)
- THE system SHALL add a basic search function that allows users to search thread titles and content using keyword matching

### User Experience Enhancements
- WHEN a member submits a new post, THE system SHALL display a confirmation message indicating successful submission within 1 second

- THE system SHALL implement a simple rating system that tracks the number of times each post has been reported

### Performance Optimization
- THE system SHALL optimize database queries for thread listing to reduce response time to under 2 seconds for pages with up to 100 threads
- THE system SHALL implement caching for frequently accessed forum content to reduce database load

## Medium-term Roadmap (6-12 months)

With the foundational system stabilized, the focus shifts to enhancing user engagement, implementing community features, and improving content discoverability.

### Advanced User Features
- WHEN a member attempts to edit their post, THE system SHALL allow changes within 24 hours of initial creation with a visible edit history
- THE system SHALL implement a bookmarking feature allowing users to save threads of interest
- THE system SHALL add a notification system that alerts users when their posts receive replies

### Community Engagement Tools
- THE system SHALL introduce a simple leaderboard that ranks members by contribution metrics (posts, replies, upvotes)
- THE system SHALL implement a "following" system allowing users to track threads and members of interest
- THE system SHALL add a basic "best of" feature that highlights high-quality content based on upvote count

### Content Quality Improvement
- THE system SHALL implement a comment section for replies, allowing users to have threaded discussions
- THE system SHALL add moderation tools for moderators to temporarily suspend accounts with repeated violations
- THE system SHALL introduce an "answer" system where users can designate one reply as the definitive response to a thread

### User Retention Strategies
- THE system SHALL implement a weekly digest email summarizing new threads and popular content
- THE system SHALL add a "community spotlight" feature that highlights active and valuable members
- THE system SHALL create a simple reputation system that tracks user contributions and recognition

## Long-term Vision (12+ months)

The long-term vision is to establish the discussion board as a trusted platform for thoughtful, informed economic and political discourse, while maintaining its core principles of simplicity and accessibility.

### Platform Differentiation
- THE system SHALL implement a "verified contributor" program that recognizes experts in specific economic or political domains
- THE system SHALL integrate with academic and journalistic sources to provide references and citations for discussion points
- THE system SHALL develop a semi-automated fact-checking system that flags claims requiring verification

### Advanced Moderation Capabilities
- THE system SHALL implement machine learning-based content analysis to detect patterns of toxicity or misinformation
- THE system SHALL create a transparent moderation system that provides explanations for content removal or account suspension
- THE system SHALL develop specialized moderation tools for handling complex political or economic discussions

### Community Ecosystem Development
- THE system SHALL establish partnerships with universities, research institutions, and media organizations
- THE system SHALL create a certification program for contributors who demonstrate subject matter expertise
- THE system SHALL implement a grant system to support independent research and analysis that informs community discussions

### Sustainability and Growth
- THE system SHALL explore monetization strategies that align with the platform's mission, including membership tiers with enhanced features
- THE system SHALL implement a governance model that allows the community to participate in platform decisions
- THE system SHALL develop a research initiative using anonymized discussion data to study public opinion on economic and political issues

## Feature Prioritization

The following prioritization framework guides feature decisions:

### Priority Criteria
- **User Impact**: How many users will benefit and how significantly
- **Business Value**: How the feature aligns with the service's mission and revenue goals
- **Technical Feasibility**: Complexity of implementation and resource requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential for unintended consequences or negative user reactions
- **Compliance Requirements**: Alignment with privacy regulations and content policies

### Prioritization Matrix
```
graph LR
    subgraph "Feature Priority Assessment"
        A[High Impact, High Value, Low Risk] --> B[Implement First]
        C[High Impact, High Value, High Risk] --> D[Implement with Caution]
        E[High Impact, Low Value, Low Risk] --> F[Consider]
        G[Low Impact, High Value, Low Risk] --> H[Implement When Resources Allow]
        I[Other Cases] --> J[Re-evaluate]
    end
```

### Implementation Sequence
1. Complete all short-term roadmap items
2. Select 2-3 medium-term features with the highest user impact
3. Begin planning long-term vision items while maintaining stability
4. Re-evaluate priorities quarterly based on user feedback and business performance

## Innovation Opportunities

The following opportunities represent potential differentiators that could position the discussion board as a leader in the space:

### Artificial Intelligence Integration
- WHEN a new thread is created on a highly contested topic, THE system SHALL automatically suggest relevant academic papers, news articles, and expert opinions
- THE system SHALL implement a conversational AI assistant that can help users understand complex economic or political concepts
- THE system SHALL develop a system that analyzes discussion patterns to identify emerging trends and insights
