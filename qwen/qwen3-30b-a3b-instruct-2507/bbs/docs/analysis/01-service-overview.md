# Service Overview and Vision

## Service Vision and Mission

The Economic/Political Discussion Board is a platform designed to facilitate meaningful, respectful, and constructive conversations about economic policies, political developments, and societal issues. Our mission is to create a space where individuals from diverse backgrounds can exchange well-reasoned perspectives, learn from different viewpoints, and contribute to informed civic discourse.

The platform aims to democratize access to high-quality economic and political discussion, making thoughtful debate accessible to anyone with an internet connection. By focusing on quality over quantity and substance over sensationalism, we strive to become a trusted resource for informed discussion in an era of information overload and polarized discourse.

## Target Market and Users

### Primary User Personas

- **General Public**: Citizens interested in understanding complex economic and political issues, including informed voters, students, educators, and professionals from various fields who want to stay informed about national and global developments.
- **Policy Enthusiasts**: Individuals with specialized interest in economics, political science, public policy, and governance who seek in-depth analysis and discussion of current events.
- **Academics and Researchers**: Professors, graduate students, and scholars in social sciences who want to share research findings, discuss theoretical models, and engage with practical policy applications.
- **Journalists and Media Professionals**: Reporters and commentators who use the platform as a source of diverse perspectives and public sentiment analysis.

### Behavioral Characteristics

- **Information Seekers**: Users who primarily read posts to understand different viewpoints on complex issues
- **Contribution Makers**: Users who actively create discussion threads and contribute thoughtful responses
- **Moderate Discerners**: Users who carefully evaluate multiple perspectives before forming opinions
- **Passive Observers**: Users who frequently browse content but may not actively participate
- **Constructive Critics**: Users who engage in debate with the goal of improving understanding rather than winning arguments

## Core Value Proposition

The Economic/Political Discussion Board delivers unique value through four key pillars:

1. **High-Quality Discussion Environment**
   - Features an intention-focused interface that prioritizes meaningful conversation over attention-grabbing content
   - Implements intelligent moderation to foster respectful discourse
   - Encourages evidence-based arguments with a focus on sources and reasoning

2. **Navigable Complexity**
   - Organizes discussions through intuitive categorization of economic and political topics
   - Provides cross-references between related discussions to help users understand connections between issues
   - Offers curated expert insights and recommended reading to supplement conversation

3. **Diverse Perspective Access**
   - Actively recruits contributors from a wide range of demographic, geographical, and ideological backgrounds
   - Implements systems to prevent echo chambers and algorithmic bias
   - Encourages exposure to viewpoints different from one's own

4. **Knowledge Amplification**
   - Creates a searchable archive of discussion threads that serves as a public knowledge repository
   - Enables users to build on existing conversations rather than reinventing the wheel
   - Provides metrics to help users identify the most informative and well-reasoned contributions

## Unique Differentiators

### 1. Focused Discussion Framework
WHEN a user creates a new thread, THE system SHALL require that the post include a clear thesis statement and specific discussion questions, meaning the post must establish what the discussion is about and what specific aspects should be explored. IF a thread lacks a clear thesis, THEN THE system SHALL prevent publication until the user adds necessary clarification.

### 2. Impact-Based Moderation System
WHILE a user is composing a post, THE system SHALL analyze the language for emotional tone, inflammatory phrasing, and logical fallacies. IF the system detects high-risk language, THEN THE system SHALL prompt the user with specific suggestions for revision and show an estimated impact score for the piece.

### 3. Perspective Diversity Metrics
WHEN a user views a discussion thread, THE system SHALL display a dashboard showing the ideological distribution of contributors, the geographic diversity of perspectives, and the range of professional backgrounds represented. IF a thread lacks perspective diversity, THEN THE system SHALL recommend related discussions with complementary viewpoints.

### 4. Fact-Checking Integration
WHEN a user claims a specific fact in a discussion, THE system SHALL provide one-click access to verify the claim against reputable sources. IF the system detects a fact that contradicts verifiable evidence, THEN THE system SHALL highlight the discrepancy and suggest corrections.

### 5. Contribution Evaluation System
WHEN a user participates in a discussion, THE system SHALL track contribution quality metrics including argument coherence, use of evidence, citation accuracy, and respect for opposing viewpoints. IF a user consistently demonstrates high-quality contribution patterns, THEN THE system SHALL award reputation points and display them in the user profile.
