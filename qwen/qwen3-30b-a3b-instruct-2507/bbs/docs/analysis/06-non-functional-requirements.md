## Security and Privacy

The system must implement robust security measures to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain user privacy.

### Authentication and Access Control
- THE system SHALL use secure, industry-standard JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with tokens that expire after 15 minutes of inactivity.
- THE system SHALL store all user passwords using bcrypt hashing with a salt value of at least 128 bits.
- THE system SHALL implement rate limiting on login attempts, blocking any IP address that attempts 5 failed login attempts within a 3-minute window.
- IF a user's session is compromised, THEN THE system SHALL automatically invalidate all active sessions and prompt the user to re-authenticate.

### Data Protection and Encryption
- THE system SHALL encrypt all user data in transit using TLS 1.3 with forward secrecy.
- THE system SHALL encrypt all sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption with key management that complies with the organization's security policy.
- THE system SHALL prevent users from entering any personal information in public posts, automatically scrubbing identifiable data before storage.
- THE system SHALL never store user login credentials in plaintext or in databases accessible to application servers.

### Privacy and Consent Requirements
- THE system SHALL obtain explicit user consent before collecting any non-essential personal information.
- THE system SHALL provide users with clear information about what data is collected and how it's used through a privacy policy accessible from every page.
- THE system SHALL allow users to download a complete copy of their personal data at any time through a dedicated interface.
- THE system SHALL provide users with the ability to request deletion of their account and all associated data, with the system completing this request within 14 days.

## Scalability Requirements

The system must be designed to accommodate growth in users, content, and traffic while maintaining performance and reliability.

### Horizontal Scaling Capabilities
- THE system SHALL be architected to enable horizontal scaling of all application services without requiring significant code changes.
- THE system SHALL support at least 10 times its initial capacity through the addition of new server instances.
- IF the system grows beyond its initial deployment configuration, THEN THE system SHALL automatically provision additional resources based on predefined load thresholds.
- THE system SHALL maintain consistent performance across all horizontally scaled instances, with no single point of failure.

### Database Scalability
- THE system SHALL be designed to support database sharding based on user ID or thread ID to distribute load.
- THE system SHALL allow for additional database replicas to be added automatically during periods of high read traffic.
- THE system SHALL implement query optimization to ensure all database operations scale efficiently as data volume increases.
