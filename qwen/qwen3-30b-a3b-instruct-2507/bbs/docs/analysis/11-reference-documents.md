# Requirements Analysis Report for Economic/Political Discussion Board

## 1. Service Overview and Vision

### Service Vision and Mission

The economic/political discussion board exists to create a focused, thoughtful space for citizens to engage in meaningful conversations about economic policies, political issues, and societal challenges. Our mission is to foster informed discourse by providing a platform where diverse perspectives can be shared, debated, and evaluated through structured discussion rather than emotional reaction.

The board serves as a digital town hall where individuals from different backgrounds can exchange ideas about government policies, economic systems, social justice, environmental regulations, and global affairs. By organizing discussions around specific topics and moderating content quality, we aim to elevate the conversation beyond superficial debates to substantive analysis and constructive dialogue.

### Target Market and Users

Our primary users are citizens passionate about social and political issues, including students, educators, professionals in public policy, activists, journalists, and concerned community members. The platform targets individuals aged 16-65 who want to participate in informed discussions about economic systems, political parties, governmental regulations, and societal changes.

The service is designed specifically for individuals who value reasoned debate and evidence-based discussion over opinion polarization. It appeals to users frustrated by the emotional, performative nature of social media debates and seeks to recapture the integrity of thoughtful public discourse.

### Core Value Proposition

The economic/political discussion board offers three primary value propositions:

1. **Structured Discussion Environment**: Unlike open social media platforms, our board provides a curated space with clear rules for participation, ensuring discussions remain productive and focused on the topic at hand.

2. **Content Quality Focus**: By implementing a reputation-based voting system and moderation framework, the board elevates well-reasoned, evidence-supported arguments while reducing the impact of misinformation and emotional appeals.

3. **Topic-Specific Forums**: The platform organizes discussions around clearly defined topics such as "Universal Basic Income," "Climate Change Policy," "Healthcare Reform," "Taxation Systems," and "International Relations," allowing users to find and engage with content directly relevant to their interests.

### Unique Differentiators

What sets our discussion board apart from other platforms:

- **Minimum 100-word posts requirement**: This criterion ensures that contributions are substantive, not superficial comments or emotional reactions. Users must demonstrate thoughtful analysis to participate.

- **Reviewer validation system**: New threads cannot be posted without being reviewed by a moderator before becoming publicly visible. This prevents misleading information and maintains content quality.

- **Color-coded reputation system**: Users' contributions are visually represented through different colors based on their reputation level, with higher reputation users having their arguments displayed more prominently.

- **Topic certification system**: We certify that certain topics are properly vetted before being added to the board, ensuring they represent legitimate, important issues rather than fringe or hypothetical concepts.

### Long-term Goals

Our long-term vision for the economic/political discussion board is to become the premier global platform for civic engagement and informed public discourse. Over the next five years, we aim to:

- Expand our user base to reach 500,000 active participants across 20 countries
- Develop partnerships with universities, research institutions, and civic organizations to enhance content quality
- Implement AI-assisted analysis tools that help users identify logical fallacies and evidence gaps in arguments
- Establish a certification program for high-quality contributors to promote academic rigor
- Create localized versions of the board in multiple languages to ensure global accessibility

## 2. Business Model and Justification

### Why This Service Exists

Modern democracy requires informed citizen participation, yet online discourse has become increasingly polarized, emotionally charged, and dominated by misinformation. Traditional social media platforms often amplify sensational content and suppress nuanced discussion through algorithmic curation.

The economic/political discussion board fills a critical gap by providing a platform specifically designed to promote substantive, evidence-based conversation about societal issues. Unlike general-purpose social networks, our service is intentionally structured to elevate quality over quantity, reason over emotion, and depth over brevity.

This service exists because existing platforms fail to address the core need for thoughtful civic engagement. Users seek a space where they can express views without being subjected to harassment, where debates are anchored in facts rather than ideology, and where complex issues can be discussed with the depth they deserve.

### Revenue Strategy

The service will generate revenue through a tiered subscription model with three distinct levels:

1. **Basic Free Tier**: Includes access to all public discussions, basic posting capabilities, and standard content discovery features. This tier will serve primarily as a user acquisition channel and content showcase.

2. **Premium Tier ($4.99/month)**: Adds enhanced features including the ability to create private discussion groups, priority moderation response time (within 2 business hours), advanced search filters, and home page customization options. This tier targets engaged users who want to contribute more meaningfully to the community.

3. **Pro Tier ($9.99/month)**: Includes all premium features plus additional capabilities such as creating public forums (with content certification), enhanced analytics for understanding discussion trends, and access to exclusive expert-led webinars on economic and political topics.

In addition to subscriptions, we will implement a targeted advertising strategy for non-intrusive, contextually relevant content. Advertisements will be limited to premium content recommendations, educational resources, and partner events that align with our mission of informed civic discourse.

### User Acquisition and Retention

Our user acquisition strategy will rely on a multi-channel approach:

- **Partnerships with educational institutions**: Collaborating with universities and colleges to integrate the discussion board into civic education curricula
- **Content marketing**: Creating high-quality blog posts, podcasts, and webinars discussing current political and economic issues
- **Social media community building**: Establishing presence on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to share thought leadership content
- **Referral program**: Offering premium features for users who successfully refer friends to join the platform
- **Press outreach**: Building relationships with journalists and analysts who cover political and economic issues

For user retention, we will focus on:

- **Gamification through reputation system**: Users earn reputation points based on the quality and impact of their contributions, encouraging sustained participation
- **Personalized content discovery**: The system learns users' interests and preferences to recommend relevant discussions
- **Weekly challenge cycles**: Periodic theme-based discussions that encourage participation on timely topics
- **Achievement badges**: Recognizing users for milestones like posting 100 quality contributions or moderating successfully

### Monetization Timeline

- **Months 1-6**: Focus on user acquisition through free tier, content marketing, and partnerships. Establish core features and community guidelines.

- **Months 7-12**: Introduce premium subscription tier with basic enhancements. Launch referral program. Begin A/B testing of advertising strategies.

- **Month 13-18**: Launch Pro tier with advanced features. Establish partnerships with academic institutions. Implement reputation system.

    C --> D[Receive official feedback from facilitator]
    D --> E[Access recording and summary]
    E --> F[Create follow-up thread]
    F --> G[Engage with other participants in extended discussion]
```

### Success Scenarios

#### The Thoughtful Contributor

A user creates a well-researched, evidence-based thread about universal basic income policy. The thread receives numerous upvotes from high-reputation users. The user's reputation score increases, and they receive a notification that their contribution has been featured in the "Top Quality Posts" section.

The user then engages in a constructive dialogue with others, building on their original argument with new data. A moderator recognizes the quality of the discussion and requests the user to contribute to a follow-up topic. This leads to increased visibility and network growth within the community.

#### The Informed Participant

A user discovers a thread about climate change policy development. They read multiple perspectives, including contrasting economic analyses from experts on both sides. The user posts a detailed reply identifying logical fallacies in one argument and citing peer-reviewed studies to support their position.

Other users respond with additional references, and the discussion evolves into a comprehensive analysis of the policy's economic implications. The user receives positive feedback from the community, which boosts their reputation and encourages further participation.

#### The Builder of Constructive Dialogue

A user identifies a polarized discussion that has become heated. They create a new thread offering a framework for respectful dialogue on the topic. The thread includes guidelines for evidence-based discussion and civility requirements.

The moderator approves the thread and promotes it to the "Best Practices" section. The community adopts the guidelines, transforming the discourse from adversarial to collaborative. The user receives recognition from the moderation team and gains additional reputation points for their constructive contribution.
