## Recovery Processes

### Authentication and Authorization Recovery

- WHEN a user receives an access denied error, THE system SHALL provide a link to the login page.
- WHEN a user's session expires, THE system SHALL automatically redirect to the login page with a message explaining the session timeout.
- IF a user encounters a permission error during posting, THE system SHALL display a helpful message explaining the role requirements and offer guidance on next steps.
- WHEN a user loses authentication while editing content, THE system SHALL preserve their draft content and prompt for re-authentication.

### Content Error Recovery

- WHEN a user submits an invalid post, THE system SHALL keep all previously entered content and highlight only the problematic fields.
- IF the character limit is exceeded, THE system SHALL display a character counter and allow the user to edit their content within the limit.
- WHEN a thread is locked, THE system SHALL display the reason for lock and provide contact information for moderators.
- IF a report is denied due to duplication, THE system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternative actions.

### System Error Recovery

- WHEN a server error occurs during a request, THE system SHALL implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
- IF a database connection fails, THE system SHALL use cached content where available and display an appropriate warning.
- WHEN a search returns no results, THE system SHALL suggest commonly used keywords based on the search query.
- IF a concurrent modification conflict occurs, THE system SHALL present a merge interface showing differences and allowing the user to choose which changes to keep.
