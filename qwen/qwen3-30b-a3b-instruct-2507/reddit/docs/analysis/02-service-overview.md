# Community Platform Requirements Analysis Report

## Service Overview and Core Functionality

The community platform is designed as a Reddit-like social content website where users can create and participate in online communities (subreddits). The platform enables users to share content through posts (text, links, images), engage in discussions through commenting, and contribute to content moderation via voting and reporting. The core value proposition is to create a decentralized space for knowledge sharing, discussion, and community building across diverse topics while maintaining a high level of user engagement and content quality.

The platform operates on a community-first model where individual users can create communities around specific interests, share content within those communities, and collaborate through voting, commenting, and reporting. The business model is built around providing a free-to-use platform with potential future monetization through premium features, sponsored content, and community branding options. The platform aims to become a primary hub for internet discourse across various topics with a focus on user autonomy, content discovery, and community governance.

## User Roles and Permissions

### Guest: Unauthenticated Users

Guests are unauthenticated users who can browse public content but cannot participate in community creation or content generation. Guests can access the platform but are restricted from posting, commenting, voting, or managing content. All guest interactions are limited to consuming content from public communities.

### Member: Standard Authenticated Users

Members are authenticated users who can create and manage posts, comment on posts, upvote and downvote content, subscribe to communities, and maintain a personal profile. Members can also report inappropriate content and participate in community discussions.

### Moderator: Community Managers

Moderators are community owners and trusted users who can manage their communities, moderate content, ban users, and handle reports. Moderators have elevated permissions within specific communities, including the ability to delete posts and comments, suspend users, and manage community settings.

### Admin: System Administrators

Admins are system administrators with full control over the platform. They can manage all users, communities, settings, reports, and system operations. Admins have unrestricted access to all platform functions and can intervene in any community or user issue.

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication and Account Management

WHEN a user registers with a valid email and password, THE system SHALL create a new account and send a verification email with a confirmation link.

IF the email verification link is not clicked within 24 hours, THEN THE system SHALL automatically delete the account and remove it from the database.

WHEN a user attempts to log in with valid credentials, THE system SHALL authenticate the user and create a session token.

WHEN a user requests password recovery, THE system SHALL generate and send a time-limited password reset link to the registered email address.

WHEN a user deletes their account, THE system SHALL permanently remove the account and all associated data, including posts, comments, karma, and profile information, after confirming the action through a two-step verification process.

### Community Creation and Management

WHEN a member attempts to create a new community, THE system SHALL provide an interface to specify community name, description, privacy settings, and rules.

WHEN a community is created, THE system SHALL automatically assign the creator as the community moderator.

WHERE a community is set to private, THE system SHALL restrict access to invite-only members who have been approved by the moderator.

WHILE a community is active, THE system SHALL prevent its name from being changed once it has been set by the creator.

### Post Creation and Content Management

WHEN a member creates a new post in a community, THE system SHALL validate that the post contains at least 5 characters of text or includes a link or image.

IF a post contains only text, THEN THE system SHALL limit the character count to 3,000 characters.

IF a post contains a link, THEN THE system SHALL validate that the URL follows standard HTTP/HTTPS formats and does not contain malicious content.

IF a post contains an image, THEN THE system SHALL verify that the file is a supported image format (JPEG, PNG, WebP) and does not exceed 10MB in size.

WHEN a member attempts to edit a post, THE system SHALL allow editing within 2 hours of creation.

WHEN a posted content is reported, THE system SHALL make it invisible to the public until reviewed by a moderator.

### Commenting System

WHEN a member creates a comment on a post, THE system SHALL validate the comment contains at least 1 character and no more than 500 characters.

WHILE the commenting system is active, THE system SHALL allow nested reply hierarchies up to 5 levels deep.

IF a comment is deleted, THEN THE system SHALL remove all nested replies that were part of the deleted comment's conversation thread.

### Voting System

WHEN a member upvotes or downvotes a post, THE system SHALL record the vote with the user ID, post ID, and timestamp.

WHEN a member votes on a post, THE system SHALL prevent multiple votes from the same user on the same post.

IF a user votes on a post and later changes their mind, THEN THE system SHALL allow the user to reverse their vote within 5 minutes of the initial vote.

WHEN a post receives votes, THE system SHALL calculate its popularity score based on the net upvote count, time decay factor, and community size.

### Karma System

WHEN a member receives an upvote on a post or comment, THE system SHALL increase their karma by 1 point.

WHEN a member receives a downvote on a post or comment, THE system SHALL decrease their karma by 1 point.

IF a user's karma reaches 1,000 points, THEN THE system SHALL display a 'Valued Contributor' badge on their profile.

IF a user's karma reaches 5,000 points, THEN THE system SHALL make the profile appear in the 'Top Contributors' list on the homepage.

### Content Sorting and Discovery

WHILE the platform is running, THE system SHALL automatically sort posts in community views by the 'hot' metric as the default sorting option.

WHEN a user selects 'New' sorting, THE system SHALL display posts in chronological order from newest to oldest.

WHEN a user selects 'Top' sorting, THE system SHALL display posts sorted by their net upvote count, with posts having higher karma and longer time in the community appearing first.

WHEN a user selects 'Controversial' sorting, THE system SHALL display posts with the highest ratio of upvotes to downvotes, emphasizing posts that generate significant discussion.

### Reporting System

WHEN a member reports inappropriate content, THE system SHALL create a pending report with timestamp, user ID, content ID, and report category.

WHERE a report is submitted, THE system SHALL notify the community moderator and the platform administrator.

WHILE a report is open, THE system SHALL prevent the reported content from being visible to the public.

IF a report is resolved, THEN THE system SHALL update the report status to 'closed' and record the resolution action.

## Business Rules and Validation Logic

The platform operates under several business rules that govern content publication, user interactions, and moderation. All content must comply with community rules and platform guidelines. Posts and comments must not contain hate speech, explicit content, copyright violations, or spam.

The system implements a content validation system that checks all posts and comments against a predefined set of rules before publication. This includes checking for malicious links, inappropriate language, and prohibited content types. If content violates rules, it will be automatically flagged for moderation.

User accounts must be associated with valid email addresses. The system will not allow registration with invalid or disposable email domains. All users must verify their email addresses before any content creation is allowed.

The voting system implements a time-based decay factor to ensure that newer content has a fair chance of visibility. Votes awarded in the first hour after a post is created have higher weight than votes awarded later.

The subreddit subscription system requires users to actively subscribe to communities they wish to follow. No content will be automatically pushed to users who are not subscribed to a community.

Community moderation follows a tiered system. Community owners have ultimate authority, followed by appointed moderators. Reports are escalated to platform administrators if moderators fail to act on reports within 24 hours.

## Error Handling and User Experience

IF a user attempts to post without being logged in, THEN THE system SHALL display a message: 'You must be logged in to create posts. Please log in or sign up to continue.'

IF a user tries to edit a post after the 2-hour window has expired, THEN THE system SHALL display: 'Editing is no longer available for this post. You may create a new post with updated content.'

IF the system fails to process a vote due to network issues, THEN THE system SHALL queue the vote and attempt to process it when connection is restored.

IF a user attempts to report content that is already closed or deleted, THEN THE system SHALL display: 'This content is no longer available. Reporting is not possible.'

IF a user's karma reaches the threshold for a badge, THEN THE system SHALL automatically display the badge and send a notification to the user.

## Performance Requirements

WHEN a user loads a community page with 20 posts, THE system SHALL load the page completely within 1.5 seconds of the request being sent.

WHEN a user submits a vote on a post, THE system SHALL receive and process the vote within 0.5 seconds.

WHEN a user searches for content using keywords, THE system SHALL display search results within 2 seconds.

WHEN a user edits a post and submits changes, THE system SHALL reflect the updated content on the page within 1 second.

WHEN a user attempts to create a new community, THE system SHALL display the creation form within 1 second.

The platform SHALL be designed to handle 10,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.

## System Integration and Dependencies

The platform integrates with several external systems and services. The email verification and password recovery functionality depends on an external email service provider. The content storage system must integrate with a cloud storage solution to handle image uploads.

The authentication system uses JWT tokens for session management, requiring integration with a secure token generation and validation service. The platform will need to integrate with a search engine API for content discovery and search functionality.

The reporting system requires integration with a notification service to alert moderators and administrators about new reports. The system must also integrate with analytics tools to track user engagement, content performance, and platform usage patterns.

The moderation and content management system must support integration with external content filtering services to automatically detect inappropriate or malicious content. The platform may also integrate with social media services to allow users to share content externally.
