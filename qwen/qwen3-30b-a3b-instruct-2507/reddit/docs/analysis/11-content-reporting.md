# Content Reporting System Requirements

## Service Vision and Purpose

The content reporting system enables users to flag inappropriate content across the community platform, creating a safety net for maintaining community standards. This system ensures that harmful, offensive, or policy-violating content is swiftly identified and addressed by moderators and administrators, preserving a healthy and respectful environment for all members. The reporting mechanism must balance user empowerment with abuse prevention to maintain platform integrity and encourage responsible community participation.

## Core Functionality

### Reporting Inappropriate Content

Users must be able to report content that violates community guidelines, including but not limited to hate speech, harassment, misinformation, explicit content, spam, and copyright violations. The reporting system should support reporting posts, comments, user profiles, and entire communities through a consistent interface.

### Report Submission

WHEN a user identifies content that violates community guidelines, THE system SHALL provide a clear, accessible reporting option directly on the content item. WHEN a user clicks the report button, THE system SHALL display a form with the following requirements:

- A dropdown selection of report categories (e.g., hate speech, harassment, spam, explicit content, misinformation, copyright violation, other)
- A text field for users to add additional context or details about why they believe the content is inappropriate (maximum 1,000 characters)
- A mandatory confirmation checkbox stating "I understand that false reports may result in penalties" with the label "Yes, I have reviewed the community guidelines and understand my responsibility"
- A submit button that processes the report

WHEN a user submits a report, THE system SHALL validate the following:

- The report category is selected
- The confirmation checkbox is checked
- The text field content is within the 1,000-character limit
- The user is authenticated (guests cannot submit reports)

IF any validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL display specific error messages indicating which field requires correction and prevent submission. IF validation succeeds, THEN THE system SHALL register the report in the database with the current timestamp, reporter's ID, reported content ID, report category, additional context, and initial status of "Pending Review".

WHILE a user is viewing a content item, THE system SHALL prevent them from submitting multiple reports on the same content within a 24-hour period. IF a user attempts to submit a second report on the same content within this timeframe, THEN THE system SHALL display a message: "You have already reported this content. Please wait 24 hours before submitting another report."

### Report Review Process

WHEN a report is created, THE system SHALL immediately notify the relevant community moderator or global administrator based on the type of content reported. THE system SHALL assign the report to the appropriate moderator according to the following prioritization:

1. For community-specific content (posts, comments, profiles), the report is assigned to the community moderator
2. For platform-wide issues (community creation, user accounts, general policy violations), the report is assigned to the global administrator

WHILE a report is under review, THE system SHALL provide the following features:

- A dashboard for moderators showing pending reports with the reporter's username, reported content type, content title/preview, timestamp, and initial report category
- The ability to view the reported content context
- The ability to view the report details including the reporter's additional context
- The ability to filter reports by status, category, community, or date
- The ability to view a history of all actions taken on the report
- The ability to assign reports to other moderators for collaboration

WHEN a moderator reviews a report, THE system SHALL provide the following actions:

- "Approve" - Content is removed and reported users may receive a warning
- "Dismiss" - Content is considered valid and no action is taken
- "Require Edit" - Content must be modified before publishing
- "Additional Review" - The report is sent to another moderator for second opinion
- "Escalate" - The report is sent to the global administrator for final decision

WHEN a moderator takes action on a report, THE system SHALL record the action with timestamp, moderator ID, action type, and notes. IF the action is "Approve" or "Require Edit", THEN THE system SHALL send a notification to the content creator with the reason and next steps.

### Moderator Actions on Reports

BEFORE a moderator takes action on a report, THE system SHALL verify their permissions. IF the moderator does not have the necessary permissions, THEN THE system SHALL display an access denied message. IF the moderator has appropriate permissions, THEN THE system SHALL allow them to take one of the predefined actions.

WHEN a moderator approves a report and removes content, THE system SHALL implement the following actions:

- Remove the content from public view immediately
- Archive the content with a reason for removal
- Log the removal in the audit trail
- Submit a notification to the content creator's user profile
- Update the user's profile karma based on the severity of the violation
- Add the report to the moderator's performance metrics

WHEN a moderator dismisses a report, THE system SHALL:

- Log the dismissal reason in the audit trail
- Update the report status to "Dismissed"
- Add the report to the moderator's performance metrics
- Do not notify the content creator

### Report Status Tracking

THE system SHALL provide real-time status tracking for all reports with the following status values:

- "Pending Review" - Report has been submitted and is waiting for moderator assignment
- "Under Review" - Report has been assigned to a moderator
- "Approved" - Content has been removed based on the report
- "Dismissed" - Report was determined to be invalid
- "Pending Edit" - Content requires modification before publication
- "Escalated" - Report has been sent to another moderator or administrator

WHILE a reporter is viewing their submitted report, THE system SHALL display the current status. IF the status changes from "Pending Review" to "Under Review", THEN THE system SHALL send a notification to the reporter: "Your report is now under review by a moderator. You will receive an update when the review is complete."

IF the status changes to "Approved", THEN THE system SHALL display a message: "Your report was accepted. The content has been removed in accordance with community guidelines. Thank you for helping to maintain a respectful community."

IF the status changes to "Dismissed", THEN THE system SHALL display a message: "Your report was reviewed but was determined to be invalid. The content does not violate community guidelines. Thank you for your contribution to the moderation process."

IF a reporter attempts to view a report they no longer have access to (e.g., after content removal), THEN THE system SHALL display: "This report is no longer available. The content has been removed from the platform."

### Reporting Moderation

THE system SHALL implement mechanisms to prevent abuse of the reporting system. IF a user submits more than 5 reports within a 24-hour period, THEN THE system SHALL display a warning: "You have submitted multiple reports. Please ensure your reports are for content that violates community guidelines. Excessive reporting may result in temporary suspension of reporting privileges."

IF a user submits 10 or more reports within a 24-hour period, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily suspend their reporting privileges for 24 hours. IF the user submits another 5 reports within the next 24 hours, THEN THE system SHALL increase the suspension period to 72 hours and add a notification to their profile: "Your reporting privileges have been restricted due to excessive reporting activity."

IF a user is found to have submitted false or malicious reports, THEN THE system SHALL apply the following penalties based on severity:

- First offense: Temporary suspension of reporting privileges for 7 days, notification to user
- Second offense: Permanent suspension of reporting privileges, permanent record in user profile
- Third offense: Account suspension for 30 days, notification to user
- Fourth offense: Permanent account deletion

The system SHALL maintain a report abuse detection algorithm that analyzes patterns of report submissions, including:

- Report-to-content ratio for each user
- Consistency of report categories across multiple reports
- Temporal patterns of report submission
- Correlation between report submissions and user activity

WHEN the algorithm detects suspicious behavior, THEN THE system SHALL flag the user's account for review by the global administrator.

### Report Analytics

THE system SHALL collect and analyze report data to identify trends and improve platform safety. THE system SHALL generate weekly reports on the following metrics:

- Total number of reports submitted
- Report category distribution
- Report resolution rate (percentage of reports that were approved)
- Average time to resolve reports
- Most reported content types (posts, comments, profiles, communities)
- Most frequently reported users
- Report abuse rate (percentage of reports that were for policy violations)
- Moderator performance metrics (cases handled, resolution time, accuracy)

THE system SHALL provide a dashboard for administrators showing:

- A timeline of report volume over time
- Geographic distribution of reports (by country/region)
- Correlation between report volume and community activity
- Most active reporting users
- Report success rate by category
- Moderator workload distribution

IF a report category shows increasing frequency, THEN THE system SHALL notify the platform safety team with a recommendation for community guideline review. IF report volume exceeds historical averages by 300% or more, THEN THE system SHALL trigger an automated alert to the safety team.

## Platform Architecture (High-Level Conceptual)

The reporting system is implemented as a service layer that integrates with the core platform. The architecture consists of the following components:

- **User Interface Layer**: Displays reporting options and status updates to users
- **Reporting Service**: Manages report lifecycle, validation, and routing
- **Moderation Management**: Coordinates report assignment and alerting
- **Analytics Engine**: Processes report data for metrics and trend analysis
- **Security Module**: Handles user authentication and access control
- **Database Layer**: Stores report records, user history, and audit trails

### Data Flow

1. User submits report through UI
2. Request sent to Reporting Service
3. Service validates inputs
4. Service creates report record
5. Service assigns report to appropriate moderator
6. Status updated in database
7. Notification sent to moderator
8. Moderator interacts with report
9. Service records moderator action
10. Status updated in database
11. Notification sent to reporter
12. Analytics Engine collects data
