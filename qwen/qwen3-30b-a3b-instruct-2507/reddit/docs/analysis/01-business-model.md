## Service Vision and Purpose

The community platform exists to create a vibrant, user-driven digital space where individuals can connect around shared interests, exchange ideas, and build meaningful relationships. The service provides the foundational infrastructure for forming and growing communities around any topic of interest, enabling users to create, share, and discuss content in a structured, governed environment.

This platform addresses the growing need for purpose-driven online spaces that foster authentic engagement, intellectual exchange, and community building in an era of algorithmically driven content and attention economy platforms. By prioritizing user autonomy, content quality, and community governance over engagement metrics, the service creates a better digital experience for people who value meaningful conversation and discovery over viral content.

## Core Value Proposition

The platform's unique value lies in its balanced approach to community building: it offers the freedom and dynamism of a social network with the organization and focus of a dedicated forum. Unlike traditional social media, where content is dictated by algorithms and user attention is commodified, this platform empowers users to create their own digital spaces with clear governance structures, transparent moderation, and meaningful participation models.

The value proposition is multilayered:

- **For Individual Users**: Access to curated communities focused on specific interests with minimal algorithmic interference, allowing them to discover relevant content and connect with like-minded individuals in a frictionless manner
- **For Community Builders**: Full control over their digital spaces including community branding, moderation tools, content organization, and membership management, with the ability to grow their communities organically
- **For Content Creators**: The ability to build audiences around specific topics, monetize their expertise, and receive meaningful engagement through the karma system that rewards quality contributions rather than popularity
- **For the Ecosystem**: A sustainable platform where community health is prioritized over platform growth, ensuring a high-quality experience that attracts and retains users over the long term

### 4.6 Post Sorting and Filtering

WHEN a user views a community's content, THE system SHALL display sorting options including "Hot", "New", "Top", and "Controversial". THE system SHALL calculate the "Hot" score by combining upvotes and submission time, giving more weight to recent activity. THE system SHALL display posts in order of the hot score, with the highest scores appearing first. THE system SHALL calculate the "New" order based on submission time, with the newest posts at the top. THE system SHALL calculate the "Top" order by sorting posts by total upvotes, with the highest individual totals first. THE system SHALL calculate the "Controversial" order by prioritizing posts with high upvote/downvote ratios, regardless of total vote count.

### 4.7 Community Subscription

WHEN a user views a community, THE system SHALL display a "Subscribe" button. WHEN a user clicks "Subscribe", THE system SHALL add the community to their list of subscribed communities. THE system SHALL record the subscription with user identifier, community identifier, and subscription date. THE system SHALL ensure users can unsubscribe at any time. THE system SHALL prioritize content from subscribed communities in the user's main feed.

### 4.8 User Profile System

WHEN a user accesses their profile, THE system SHALL display their username, profile picture, karma score, member since date, and a tabbed interface for posts and comments. THE system SHALL display a list of posts authored by the user, including title, community name, submission date, and upvote count, with pagination to prevent performance issues. THE system SHALL display a list of comments made by the user, including the post title, community name, comment content, submission date, and upvote count, with pagination.
