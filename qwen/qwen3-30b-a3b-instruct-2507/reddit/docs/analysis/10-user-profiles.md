# Requirements Analysis Report for Reddit-like Community Platform

## Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive requirements analysis report for the development of a Reddit-like community platform. The platform will enable users to create communities where they can share text, links, and images through posts, engage in discussions via comments with nested replies, and participate in content governance through voting and reporting systems.

## User Roles

The platform implements a multi-tiered role system to manage user access and responsibilities. Each role has specific capabilities that support the platform's mission while maintaining security and content quality.

### Guest: Unauthenticated Users

Guests are users who have not registered or logged in to the platform. They have fundamental access limitations designed to protect the platform's integrity while allowing discovery of content. Guests can browse public communities and view posts, but they cannot contribute content, interact with others' content, or access personal features.

### Member: Standard Authenticated Users

Members are users who have registered and authenticated with the platform using email and password. They have full access to core community features and are considered active participants. Members can create posts, comment on content, upvote or downvote posts and comments, subscribe to communities, and maintain user profiles. Members are the primary content creators and contributors to the platform's ecosystem.

### Moderator: Community Managers

Moderators are users with trusted roles within specific communities. They are typically community owners or users appointed by community owners. Moderators have elevated permissions to manage their communities, including content moderation, user management through bans and warnings, handling reports, and managing community settings. Moderators play a crucial role in maintaining community health and enforcing community rules.

### Admin: System Administrators

Admins are platform-level users with comprehensive control over the entire system. They have access to all features and data across all communities and user accounts. Admins can manage user accounts, handle global reports, modify system settings, implement policy changes, and monitor platform-wide metrics. Admins serve as the ultimate authority for ensuring platform integrity, security, and compliance.

## Core Features

### User Registration and Login

The platform will implement a secure authentication system with multiple layers of protection. Users create accounts using email and password authentication. The registration process includes email verification to prevent spam and ensure account validity. Users can log in to access their personal content and features.

### Create Communities (Subreddits)

Users can create communities around specific topics, enabling focused discussions around shared interests. Community creation includes establishing a unique name, description, privacy settings, and category selection. The system will provide tools for managing community content, members, and rules.

### Post Creation and Management

Users can create posts with text content, URLs, and image attachments up to 10MB in size. Posts are timestamped and prominently displayed in community feeds. Users have a 24-hour window to edit their posts after creation. After this period, editing is no longer available to maintain content integrity.

### Commenting System with Nested Replies

The commenting system supports nested replies with up to 5 levels of depth, allowing for rich, multi-layered discussions. Users can reply to posts and respond to other users' comments, creating natural conversation threads. Comments have a maximum length of 1,000 characters to prevent overly long responses.

### Voting System

The platform implements an upvote and downvote system to allow users to express their opinions about content. Each user can cast one vote per post or comment, providing a clear indication of their preference. Votes are counted as the net score (upvotes minus downvotes) for sorting purposes.

### User Karma System

The karma system is a core component of the platform's reputation model. Users earn karma points for positive contributions: +1 for each upvote on their posts and comments and -1 for each downvote on their posts and comments. This system incentivizes quality contributions and discourages low-value or negative content.

### Post Sorting

The system allows users to sort posts by:
- **Hot**: Rank posts by engagement (upvotes + downvotes) over time
- **New**: Sort posts by creation date (newest first)
- **Top**: Sort posts by engagement (upvotes - downvotes)
- **Controversial**: Rank posts by engagement variance (ratio of upvotes to downvotes)

### Subscribe to Communities

Users can subscribe to communities they find interesting, ensuring they receive updates when new content is posted. Subscribed communities appear in the user's personalized feed.

### User Profiles

Each user maintains a profile that displays their public information, including username, karma score, account creation date, and profile picture. The profile also shows a timeline of their activity, including posts they've created and comments they've written. The system provides a summary of their participation across multiple communities.

### Content Reporting

Users can report inappropriate content to maintain community standards. The reporting system allows users to flag posts, comments, user profiles, and entire communities. Reports are reviewed by moderators or administrators who can take appropriate actions based on community guidelines.

## Business Requirements

## Technical Implementation Considerations

While this document focuses on business and functional requirements, the following technical aspects are crucial for the platform's success:

- **Database Design**: The system requires a relational database with proper indexing for high-performance queries on posts, comments, votes, and users.
- **Caching Strategy**: Implementing Redis or similar in-memory caching will significantly improve read performance for community feeds.
- **Scalability**: The platform should be designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers and use load balancing.
- **Content Delivery**: Static content such as images and videos should be served through a CDN for faster delivery.
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring are essential for tracking system health and user behavior.

## Development Roadmap

The platform development follows a phased approach to ensure stability and quality:

1. **Phase 1 - Core Platform** (MVP): Implement authentication, community creation, basic posting, commenting, and voting functionality.
2. **Phase 2 - Moderation and Security**: Add content reporting, user reporting, moderation tools, and enhanced security measures.
