The business model is built around providing a free-to-use platform with potential future monetization through premium features, sponsored content, and community branding options. The platform aims to become a primary hub for internet discourse across various topics with a focus on user autonomy, content discovery, and community governance.\n\n## User Roles and Permissions\n\n### Guest: Unauthenticated Users\n\nGuests are unauthenticated users who can browse public content but cannot participate in community creation or content generation. Guests can access the platform but are restricted from posting, commenting, voting, or managing content. All guest interactions are limited to consuming content from public communities.\n\n### Member: Standard Authenticated Users\n\nMembers are authenticated users who can create and manage posts, comment on posts, upvote and downvote content, subscribe to communities, and maintain a personal profile. Members can also report inappropriate content and participate in community discussions.\n\n### Moderator: Community Managers\n\nModerators are community owners and trusted users who can manage their communities, moderate content, ban users, and handle reports. Moderators have elevated permissions within specific communities, including the ability to delete posts and comments, suspend users, and manage community settings.\n\n### Admin: System Administrators\n\nAdmins are system administrators with full control over the platform. They can manage all users, communities, settings, reports, and system operations. Admins have unrestricted access to all platform functions and can intervene in any community or user issue.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Authentication and Account Management\n\nWHEN a user registers with a valid email and password, THE system SHALL create a new account and send a verification email with a confirmation link.\n\nIF the email verification link is not clicked within 24 hours, THEN THE system SHALL automatically delete the account and remove it from the database.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to log in with valid credentials, THE system SHALL authenticate the user and create a session token.\n\nWHEN a user requests password recovery, THE system SHALL generate and send a time-limited password reset link to the registered email address.\n\nWHEN a user deletes their account, THE system SHALL permanently remove the account and all associated data, including posts, comments, karma, and profile information, after confirming the action through a two-step verification process.\n\n### Community Creation and Management\n\nWHEN a member attempts to create a new community, THE system SHALL provide an interface to specify community name, description, privacy settings, and rules.\n\nWHEN a community is created, THE system SHALL automatically assign the creator as the community moderator.\n\nWHERE a community is set to private, THE system SHALL restrict access to invite-only members who have been approved by the moderator.\n\nWHILE a community is active, THE system SHALL prevent its name from being changed once it has been set by the creator.\n\n### Post Creation and Content Management\n\nWHEN a member creates a new post in a community, THE system SHALL validate that the post contains at least 5 characters of text or includes a link or image.\n\nIF a post contains only text, THEN THE system SHALL limit the character count to 3,000 characters.\n\nIF a post contains a link, THEN THE system SHALL validate that the URL follows standard HTTP/HTTPS formats and does not contain malicious content.\n\nIF a post contains an image, THEN THE system SHALL verify that the file is a supported image format (JPEG, PNG, WebP) and does not exceed 10MB in size.\n\nWHEN a member attempts to edit a post, THE system SHALL allow editing within 2 hours of creation.\n\nWHEN a posted content is reported, THE system SHALL make it invisible to the public until reviewed by a moderator.\n\n### Commenting System\n\nWHEN a member creates a comment on a post, THE system SHALL validate the comment contains at least 1 character and no more than 500 characters.\n\nWHILE the commenting system is active, THE system SHALL allow nested reply hierarchies up to 5 levels deep.\n\nIF a comment is deleted, THEN THE system SHALL remove all nested replies that were part of the deleted comment's conversation thread.\n\n### Voting System\n\nWHEN a member upvotes or downvotes a post, THE system SHALL record the vote with the user ID, post ID, and timestamp.\n\nWHEN a member votes on a post, THE system SHALL prevent multiple votes from the same user on the same post.\n\nIF a user votes on a post and later changes their mind, THEN THE system SHALL allow the user to reverse their vote within 5 minutes of the initial vote.\n\nWHEN a post receives votes, THE system SHALL calculate its popularity score based on the net upvote count, time decay factor, and community size.\n\n### Karma System\n\nWHEN a member receives an upvote on a post or comment, THE system SHALL increase their karma by 1 point.\n\nWHEN a member receives a downvote on a post or comment, THE system SHALL decrease their karma by 1 point.\n\nIF a user's karma reaches 1,000 points, THEN THE system SHALL display a 'Valued Contributor' badge on their profile.\n\nIF a user's karma reaches 5,000 points, THEN THE system SHALL make the profile appear in the 'Top Contributors' list on the homepage.\n\n### Content Sorting and Discovery\n\nWHILE the platform is running, THE system SHALL automatically sort posts in community views by the 'hot' metric as the default sorting option.\n\nWHEN a user selects 'New' sorting, THE system SHALL display posts in chronological order from newest to oldest.\n\nWHEN a user selects 'Top' sorting, THE system SHALL display posts sorted by their net upvote count, with posts having higher karma and longer time in the community appearing first.\n\nWHEN a user selects 'Controversial' sorting, THE system SHALL display posts with the highest ratio of upvotes to downvotes, emphasizing posts that generate significant discussion.\n\n### Reporting System\n\nWHEN a member reports inappropriate content, THE system SHALL create a pending report with timestamp, user ID, content ID, and report category.\n\nWHERE a report is submitted, THE system SHALL notify the community moderator and the platform administrator.\n\nWHILE a report is open, THE system SHALL prevent the reported content from being visible to the public.\n\nIF a report is resolved, THEN THE system SHALL update the report status to 'closed' and record the resolution action.\n\n## Business Rules and Validation Logic\n\nThe platform operates under several business rules that govern content publication, user interactions, and moderation. All content must comply with community rules and platform guidelines. Posts and comments must not contain hate speech, explicit content, copyright violations, or spam.\n\nThe system implements a content validation system that checks all posts and comments against a predefined set of rules before publication. This includes checking for malicious links, inappropriate language, and prohibited content types. If content violates rules, it will be automatically flagged for moderation.\n\nUser accounts must be associated with valid email addresses. The system will not allow registration with invalid or disposable email domains. All users must verify their email addresses before any content creation is allowed.\n\nThe voting system implements a time-based decay factor to ensure that newer content has a fair chance of visibility. Votes awarded in the first hour after a post is created have higher weight than votes awarded later.\n\nThe subreddit subscription system requires users to actively subscribe to communities they wish to follow. No content will be automatically pushed to users who are not subscribed to a community.\n\nCommunity moderation follows a tiered system. Community owners have ultimate authority, followed by appointed moderators. Reports are escalated to platform administrators if moderators fail to act on reports within 24 hours.\n\n## Error Handling and User Experience\n\nIF a user attempts to post without being logged in, THEN THE system SHALL display a message: 'You must be logged in to create posts. Please log in or sign up to continue.'\n\nIF a user tries to edit a post after the 2-hour window has expired, THEN THE system SHALL display: 'Editing is no longer available for this post. You may create a new post with updated content.'\n\nIF the system fails to process a vote due to network issues, THEN THE system SHALL queue the vote and attempt to process it when connection is restored.\n\nIF a user attempts to report content that is already closed or deleted, THEN THE system SHALL display: 'This content is no longer available. Reporting is not possible.'\n\nIF a user's karma reaches the threshold for a badge, THEN THE system SHALL automatically display the badge and send a notification to the user.\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nWHEN a user loads a community page with 20 posts, THE system SHALL load the page completely within 1.5 seconds of the request being sent.\n\nWHEN a user submits a vote on a post, THE system SHALL receive and process the vote within 0.5 seconds.\n\nWHEN a user searches for content using keywords, THE system SHALL display search results within 2 seconds.\n\nWHEN a user edits a post and submits changes, THE system SHALL reflect the updated content on the page within 1 second.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to create a new community, THE system SHALL display the creation form within 1 second.\n\nThe platform SHALL be designed to handle 10,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.\n\n## System Integration and Dependencies\n\nThe platform integrates with several external systems and services. The email verification and password recovery functionality depends on an external email service provider. The content storage system must integrate with a cloud storage solution to handle image uploads.\n\nThe authentication system uses JWT tokens for session management, requiring integration with a secure token generation and validation service. The platform will need to integrate with a search engine API for content discovery and search functionality.\n\nThe reporting system requires integration with a notification service to alert moderators and administrators about new reports. The system must also integrate with analytics tools to track user engagement, content performance, and platform usage patterns.\n\nThe moderation and content management system must support integration with external content filtering services to automatically detect inappropriate or malicious content. The platform may also integrate with social media services to allow users to share content externally.\n\n## State Diagram: Community Post Lifecycle\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A["},{"reason":"To define all user roles with their permissions, responsibilities, and access levels, establishing the foundation for the authentication and authorization system.","filename":"03-user-roles.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["User Roles and Permissions","Guest: Unauthenticated Users","Member: Standard Authenticated Users","Moderator: Community Managers","Admin: System Administrators","Permission Matrix","Authentication Flow Requirements"],"audience":"development team","detailLevel":"detailed specification","relatedDocuments":["00-toc.md","03-user-roles.md"],"content":"# User Roles and Permissions\n\n## User Roles and Permissions\n\n### Guest: Unauthenticated Users\n\n**Definition**: Unauthenticated users who can browse public content, sign up, and log in.

create a session token.\n\nWHEN a user requests password recovery, THE system SHALL generate and send a time-limited password reset link to the registered email address.\n\nWHEN a user deletes their account, THE system SHALL permanently remove the account and all associated data, including posts, comments, karma, and profile information, after confirming the action through a two-step verification process.\n\n### Community Creation and Management\n\nWHEN a member attempts to create a new community, THE system SHALL provide an interface to specify community name, description, privacy settings, and rules.\n\nWHEN a community is created, THE system SHALL automatically assign the creator as the community moderator.\n\nWHERE a community is set to private, THE system SHALL restrict access to invite-only members who have been approved by the moderator.\n\nWHILE a community is active, THE system SHALL prevent its name from being changed once it has been set by the creator.\n\n### Post Creation and Content Management\n\nWHEN a member creates a new post in a community, THE system SHALL validate that the post contains at least 5 characters of text or includes a link or image.\n\nIF a post contains only text, THEN THE system SHALL limit the character count to 3,000 characters.\n\nIF a post contains a link, THEN THE system SHALL validate that the URL follows standard HTTP/HTTPS formats and does not contain malicious content.\n\nIF a post contains an image, THEN THE system SHALL verify that the file is a supported image format (JPEG, PNG, WebP) and does not exceed 10MB in size.\n\nWHEN a member attempts to edit a post, THE system SHALL allow editing within 2 hours of creation.\n\nWHEN a posted content is reported, THE system SHALL make it invisible to the public until reviewed by a moderator.\n\n### Commenting System\n\nWHEN a member creates a comment on a post, THE system SHALL validate the comment contains at least 1 character and no more than 500 characters.\n\nWHILE the commenting system is active, THE system SHALL allow nested reply hierarchies up to 5 levels deep.\n\nIF a comment is deleted, THEN THE system SHALL remove all nested replies that were part of the deleted comment's conversation thread.\n\n### Voting System\n\nWHEN a member upvotes or downvotes a post, THE system SHALL record the vote with the user ID, post ID, and timestamp.\n\nWHEN a member votes on a post, THE system SHALL prevent multiple votes from the same user on the same post.\n\nIF a user votes on a post and later changes their mind, THEN THE system SHALL allow the user to reverse their vote within 5 minutes of the initial vote.\n\nWHEN a post receives votes, THE system SHALL calculate its popularity score based on the net upvote count, time decay factor, and community size.\n\n### Karma System\n\nWHEN a member receives an upvote on a post or comment, THE system SHALL increase their karma by 1 point.\n\nWHEN a member receives a downvote on a post or comment, THE system SHALL decrease their karma by 1 point.\n\nIF a user's karma reaches 1,000 points, THEN THE system SHALL display a 'Valued Contributor' badge on their profile.\n\nIF a user's karma reaches 5,000 points, THEN THE system SHALL make the profile appear in the 'Top Contributors' list on the homepage.\n\n### Content Sorting and Discovery\n\nWHILE the platform is running, THE system SHALL automatically sort posts in community views by the 'hot' metric as the default sorting option.\n\nWHEN a user selects 'New' sorting, THE system SHALL display posts in chronological order from newest to oldest.\n\nWHEN a user selects 'Top' sorting, THE system SHALL display posts sorted by their net upvote count, with posts having higher karma and longer time in the community appearing first.\n\nWHEN a user selects 'Controversial' sorting, THE system SHALL display posts with the highest ratio of upvotes to downvotes, emphasizing posts that generate significant discussion.\n\n### Reporting System\n\nWHEN a member reports inappropriate content, THE system SHALL create a pending report with timestamp, user ID, content ID, and report category.\n\nWHERE a report is submitted, THE system SHALL notify the community moderator and the platform administrator.\n\nWHILE a report is open, THE system SHALL prevent the reported content from being visible to the public.\n\nIF a report is resolved, THEN THE system SHALL update the report status to 'closed' and record the resolution action.\n\n## Business Rules and Validation Logic\n\nThe platform operates under several business rules that govern content publication, user interactions, and moderation. All content must comply with community rules and platform guidelines. Posts and comments must not contain hate speech, explicit content, copyright violations, or spam.\n\nThe system implements a content validation system that checks all posts and comments against a predefined set of rules before publication. This includes checking for malicious links, inappropriate language, and prohibited content types. If content violates rules, it will be automatically flagged for moderation.\n\nUser accounts must be associated with valid email addresses. The system will not allow registration with invalid or disposable email domains. All users must verify their email addresses before any content creation is allowed.\n\nThe voting system implements a time-based decay factor to ensure that newer content has a fair chance of visibility. Votes awarded in the first hour after a post is created have higher weight than votes awarded later.\n\nThe subreddit subscription system requires users to actively subscribe to communities they wish to follow. No content will be automatically pushed to users who are not subscribed to a community.\n\nCommunity moderation follows a tiered system. Community owners have ultimate authority, followed by appointed moderators. Reports are escalated to platform administrators if moderators fail to act on reports within 24 hours.\n\n## Error Handling and User Experience\n\nIF a user attempts to post without being logged in, THEN THE system SHALL display a message: 'You must be logged in to create posts. Please log in or sign up to continue.'\n\nIF a user tries to edit a post after the 2-hour window has expired, THEN THE system SHALL display: 'Editing is no longer available for this post. You may create a new post with updated content.'\n\nIF the system fails to process a vote due to network issues, THEN THE system SHALL queue the vote and attempt to process it when connection is restored.\n\nIF a user attempts to report content that is already closed or deleted, THEN THE system SHALL display: 'This content is no longer available. Reporting is not possible.'\n\nIF a user's karma reaches the threshold for a badge, THEN THE system SHALL automatically display the badge and send a notification to the user.\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nWHEN a user loads a community page with 20 posts, THE system SHALL load the page completely within 1.5 seconds of the request being sent.\n\nWHEN a user submits a vote on a post, THE system SHALL receive and process the vote within 0.5 seconds.\n\nWHEN a user searches for content using keywords, THE system SHALL display search results within 2 seconds.\n\nWHEN a user edits a post and submits changes, THE system SHALL reflect the updated content on the page within 1 second.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to create a new community, THE system SHALL display the creation form within 1 second.\n\nThe platform SHALL be designed to handle 10,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.\n\n## System Integration and Dependencies\n\nThe platform integrates with several external systems and services. The email verification and password recovery functionality depends on an external email service provider. The content storage system must integrate with a cloud storage solution to handle image uploads.\n\nThe authentication system uses JWT tokens for session management, requiring integration with a secure token generation and validation service. The platform will need to integrate with a search engine API for content discovery and search functionality.\n\nThe reporting system requires integration with a notification service to alert moderators and administrators about new reports. The system must also integrate with analytics tools to track user engagement, content performance, and platform usage patterns.\n\nThe moderation and content management system must support integration with external content filtering services to automatically detect inappropriate or malicious content. The platform may also integrate with social media services to allow users to share content externally.\n\n## State Diagram: Community Post Lifecycle\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Community Created] --> B[Post Submitted]\n    B --> C[Post Approved]\n    C --> D{Content Reports?}\n    D -->|Yes| E[Reported for Review]\n    D -->|No| F[Subscribe to Community]\n    E --> G[Under Review]\n    G --> H[Approved]\n    G --> I[Flagged for Removal]\n    H --> J[Displayed on Front Page]\n    I --> K[Removed from View]\n    K --> L[Appeal Process]\n    L --> M[Reinstated]\n    L --> N[Re-verified]\n    M --> O[Displayed on Front Page]\n    N --> P[Content Delisted]\n```\n\n## User Journey: Account Registration\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User Visits Registration Page] --> B[Enters Email]\n    B --> C[Enters Password]\n    C --> D{Password Meets Requirements?}\n    D -->|No| E[Displays Error: \"Password must be at least 8 characters long...\" ]\n    D -->|Yes| F[Clicks Register]\n    F --> G[Email Sent with Verification Link]\n    G --> H{User Clicks Verification Link?}\n    H -->|No| I[Account Deleted After 24h]\n    H -->|Yes| J[Account Verified]\n    J --> K[Login Page Shown]\n```\n\n## User Journey: Post Creation\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User Navigates to Community] --> B[Clicks \"Create Post\"]\n    B --> C[Enters Post Content]\n    C --> D{Valid Post?}\n    D -->|No| E[Displays Error: \"Post must have at least 5 characters...\" ]\n    D -->|Yes| F[Clicks Submit]\n    F --> G[Post Added to Community]\n    G --> H[Appears in Community Feed]\n    H --> I[Users Can Vote and Comment]\n```\n\n## User Journey: Content Moderation\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User Reports Content] --> B[Report Received]\n    B --> C[Notify Moderator]\n    C --> D{Under Review?}\n    D -->|Yes| E[Assigned to Moderator]\n    D -->|No| F[Invalid Report]\n    E --> G[Review Content]\n    G --> H{Approve?}\n    H -->|Yes| I[Delete Content]\n    H -->|No| J[Keep Content]\n    I --> K[Notify Reporter]\n    J --> L[Close Case]\n```\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

The platform architecture is designed to support millions of users and provide a secure, scalable, and engaging experience for content creation and community interaction. The system embodies the core principles of social content sharing with emphasis on user-generated content, community moderation, and reputation-based systems.\n\n## User Roles and Permissions\n\nThe platform implements a multi-tiered role system to manage user access and responsibilities across the community ecosystem. Each role has specific capabilities that support the platform's mission while maintaining security and content quality.\n\n### Guest: Unauthenticated Users\n\nGuests are users who have not registered or logged in to the platform. They have fundamental access limitations designed to protect the platform's integrity while allowing discovery of content. Guests can browse public communities and view posts, but they cannot contribute content, interact with others' content, or access personal features.\n\n### Member: Standard Authenticated Users\n\nMembers are users who have registered and authenticated with the platform using email and password. They have full access to core community features and are considered active participants. Members can create posts, comment on content, upvote or downvote posts and comments, subscribe to communities, and maintain user profiles. Members are the primary content creators and contributors to the platform's ecosystem.\n\n### Moderator: Community Managers\n\nModerators are users with trusted roles within specific communities. They are typically community owners or users appointed by community owners. Moderators have elevated permissions to manage their communities, including content moderation, user management through bans and warnings, handling reports, and managing community settings. Moderators play a crucial role in maintaining community health and enforcing community rules.\n\n### Admin: System Administrators\n\nAdmins are platform-level users with comprehensive control over the entire system. They have access to all features and data across all communities and user accounts. Admins can manage user accounts, handle global reports, modify system settings, implement policy changes, and monitor platform-wide metrics. Admins serve as the ultimate authority for ensuring platform integrity, security, and compliance.\n\n## User Authentication and Session Management\n\nThe platform implements a secure authentication system with multiple layers of protection. Users create accounts using email and password authentication. The registration process includes email verification to prevent spam and ensure account validity. Users can log in to access their personal content and features.\n\nThe system maintains user sessions across multiple devices and browsers. Sessions automatically expire after 30 minutes of inactivity to maintain security. The platform implements rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks (5 failed attempts within 15 minutes triggers account lockout). All user data, including passwords, are encrypted at rest and in transit.\n\n## Community Platform Architecture\n\nThe platform architecture is designed to support high availability, scalability, and performance. The system uses a microservices approach with distinct services for account management, content delivery, community management, voting, reporting, and analytics. The database is structured to support fast reads of community content while maintaining write consistency for user interactions.\n\nThe system implements caching strategies to improve performance for frequently accessed content. Content is stored with metadata including creation timestamps, author information, and content type. The system uses horizontal scaling to handle large numbers of concurrent users and content creation.\n\n## Core Functionality and User Experience\n\nThe platform's user experience is designed around content discovery, contribution, and community engagement. Users can create accounts, join communities, and participate in discussions through various content types including text posts, links to external content, and image uploads.\n\n### Post Creation and Management\n\nUsers can create posts with up to 10,000 characters of text, links to external websites, or image attachments up to 10MB in size. Posts are timestamped with their creation time and prominently displayed in community feeds. Users have a 24-hour window to edit their posts after creation. After this period, editing is no longer available to maintain content integrity.\n\nThe system uses sophisticated algorithms to determine the order of posts in community feeds. Users can choose between sorting by 'hot' (most popular), 'new' (chronological), 'top' (highest score), and 'controversial' (balanced votes) to tailor their browsing experience. The system automatically refreshes the feed every 30 seconds to ensure users see the most current content.\n\n### Voting System\n\nThe platform implements an upvote and downvote system to allow users to express their opinions about content. Each user can cast one vote per post or comment, providing a clear indication of their preference. Votes are counted as the net score (upvotes minus downvotes) for sorting purposes.\n\nThe system prevents vote manipulation through multiple mechanisms including rate limiting (users cannot vote again within 30 seconds of their last vote). Complex algorithms detect and prevent automated voting patterns that could artificially inflate scores. Users can reverse their votes by casting a different type of vote, which immediately updates the score.\n\n### Commenting and Discussion\n\nThe commenting system supports nested replies with up to 5 levels of depth, allowing for rich, multi-layered discussions. Users can reply to posts and respond to other users' comments, creating natural conversation threads. Comments have a maximum length of 1,000 characters to prevent overly long responses.\n\nThe system displays a 'load more replies' button for long comment threads, allowing users to expand conversations as needed. When a user deletes a comment, the system recursively removes all nested replies to maintain thread integrity. Content filtering automatically detects and blocks inappropriate content in comments.\n\n### User Profiles and Reputation\n\nEach user maintains a profile that displays their public information, including username, karma score, account creation date, and profile picture. The profile also shows a timeline of their activity, including posts they've created and comments they've written. The system provides a summary of their participation across multiple communities.\n\n## Karma System and User Recognition\n\nThe karma system is a core component of the platform's reputation model. Users earn karma points for positive contributions: +1 for each upvote on their posts and comments and -1 for each downvote. This system incentivizes quality contributions and discourages low-value or negative content.\n\nKarma points are displayed on user profiles and influence user status within communities. The system automatically awards badges at specific karma thresholds: 100 for \"New Contributor,\" 500 for \"Active Contributor,\" 1,000 for \"Valued Member,\" and 5,000 for \"Community Leader.\" These badges provide visible recognition of user contributions.\n\nTo encourage long-term engagement, the system implements karma decay, where inactive users lose 10% of their karma annually. This prevents the accumulation of inactive users with inflated reputation scores. The system also provides 'karma forgiveness' mechanisms where users can recover lost karma through community service activities such as moderating content or writing helpful posts.\n\n## Content Moderation and Reporting\n\nThe platform implements a comprehensive moderation system to maintain community health and safety. Users can report posts and comments that violate community rules or platform policies. When a report is submitted, the system creates a report entry with the reason, timestamp, and user ID, and notifies the relevant community moderator.\n\nModerators receive a dedicated review queue to manage incoming reports efficiently. They can take various actions including removing content, issuing warnings to users, or banning users from the community. The system maintains a complete report history with timestamps, statuses, and actions taken for transparency and audit purposes.\n\nThe system implements automated content filtering to detect potentially inappropriate material in posts and comments. This includes keyword matching, image analysis for explicit content, and pattern recognition for spam. Users who repeatedly violate community rules may face escalating consequences including temporary suspensions and permanent bans.\n\n## Platform Growth and Business Strategy\n\nThe communityPlatform operates on a freemium business model to ensure accessibility while creating sustainable revenue. The platform offers core features such as community creation, content sharing, and basic engagement tools at no cost to all users. Premium features including advanced analytics, enhanced moderation tools, custom themes, and ad-free browsing are available through subscription plans.\n\nThe revenue strategy also includes sponsored content and promoted posts within communities. Content creators and organizations can pay to have their posts featured in community feeds or highlighted to specific user segments. This approach maintains the organic nature of community content while providing valuable marketing opportunities.\n\nThe growth plan focuses on organic user acquisition through content virality and community referrals. The platform targets niche communities and content creators to build a foundation of loyal, engaged users. As the user base expands, the platform will implement targeted marketing campaigns and form partnerships with influencers and media outlets to reach new audiences.\n\n## Success Metrics and Key Performance Indicators\n\nThe platform's success is measured through a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Key performance indicators include Daily Active Users (DAU), Monthly Active Users (MAU), average session duration, user retention rate, and the number of communities created. The platform tracks engagement metrics such as posts per community, average upvotes per post, and comment frequency.\n\nUser satisfaction is assessed through regular surveys and feedback mechanisms. The platform monitors the ratio of positive to negative interactions to gauge community health. The system tracks moderation efficiency, including the average time to review reports and the number of reports resolved per moderator.\n\n## Security and Compliance\n\nThe platform prioritizes user security and data privacy. All user communications use HTTPS encryption to protect data in transit. User passwords are stored using bcrypt hashing with salt to prevent password cracking. The system implements rate limiting to prevent automated attacks and CSRF protection for all state-changing operations.\n\nThe platform complies with GDPR and other data protection regulations. Users have the right to export their data and request deletion of their accounts and associated information. The system maintains comprehensive audit logs for security and compliance purposes and implements regular backups to ensure data recovery.\n\n## Technical Implementation Considerations\n\nWhile this document focuses on business and functional requirements, the following technical aspects are crucial for the platform's success:\n\n- **Database Design**: The system requires a relational database with proper indexing for high-performance queries on posts, comments, votes, and users.\n- **Caching Strategy**: Implementing Redis or similar in-memory caching will significantly improve read performance for community feeds.\n- **Scalability**: The platform should be designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers and use load balancing.\n- **Content Delivery**: Static content such as images and videos should be served through a CDN for faster delivery.\n- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring are essential for tracking system health and user behavior.\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\nThe platform development follows a phased approach to ensure stability and quality:\n\n1. **Phase 1 - Core Platform** (MVP): Implement authentication, community creation, basic posting, commenting, and voting functionality.\n2. **Phase 2 - Moderation and Security**: Add content reporting, user reporting, moderation tools, and enhanced security measures.\n3. **Phase 3 - Advanced Features**: Implement advanced analytics, premium features, and sponsored content capabilities.\n4. **Phase 4 - Expansion and Optimization**: Add support for multiple languages, internationalization features, and further performance optimizations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe communityPlatform is designed to become a leading online space for quality community engagement. By combining robust technical architecture with thoughtful user experience design and effective community management tools, the platform creates an environment where users can connect around shared interests, share knowledge, and build meaningful relationships. The system's emphasis on user reputation through the karma system, combined with effective moderation tools and security measures, ensures a healthy, respectful community environment that encourages positive contributions and discourages abuse.\n\nThis comprehensive requirements analysis provides the foundation for building a platform that meets the needs of users while maintaining the integrity and sustainability of the community ecosystem. The documented requirements serve as the blueprint for development, ensuring alignment between business goals and technical implementation.\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

For platform-wide issues (community creation, user accounts, general policy violations), the report is assigned to the global administrator\n\nWHILE a report is under review, THE system SHALL provide the following features:\n\n- A dashboard for moderators showing pending reports with the reporter's username, reported content type, content title/preview, timestamp, and initial report category\n- The ability to view the reported content context\n- The ability to view the report details including the reporter's additional context\n- The ability to filter reports by status, category, community, or date\n- The ability to view a history of all actions taken on the report\n- The ability to assign reports to other moderators for collaboration\n\nWHEN a moderator reviews a report, THE system SHALL provide the following actions:\n\n- \"Approve\" - Content is removed and reported users may receive a warning\n- \"Dismiss\" - Content is considered valid and no action is taken\n- \"Require Edit\" - Content must be modified before publishing\n- \"Additional Review\" - The report is sent to another moderator for second opinion\n- \"Escalate\" - The report is sent to the global administrator for final decision\n\nWHEN a moderator takes action on a report, THE system SHALL record the action with timestamp, moderator ID, action type, and notes. IF the action is \"Approve\" or \"Require Edit\", THEN THE system SHALL send a notification to the content creator with the reason and next steps.\n\n### Moderator Actions on Reports\n\nBEFORE a moderator takes action on a report, THE system SHALL verify their permissions. IF the moderator does not have the necessary permissions, THEN THE system SHALL display an access denied message. IF the moderator has appropriate permissions, THEN THE system SHALL allow them to take one of the predefined actions.\n\nWHEN a moderator approves a report and removes content, THE system SHALL implement the following actions:\n\n- Remove the content from public view immediately\n- Archive the content with a reason for removal\n- Log the removal in the audit trail\n- Submit a notification to the content creator's user profile\n- Update the user's profile karma based on the severity of the violation\n- Add the report to the moderator's performance metrics\n\nWHEN a moderator dismisses a report, THE system SHALL:\n\n- Log the dismissal reason in the audit trail\n- Update the report status to \"Dismissed\"\n- Add the report to the moderator's performance metrics\n- Do not notify the content creator\n\n### Report Status Tracking\n\nTHE system SHALL provide real-time status tracking for all reports with the following status values:\n\n- \"Pending Review\" - Report has been submitted and is waiting for moderator assignment\n- \"Under Review\" - Report has been assigned to a moderator\n- \"Approved\" - Content has been removed based on the report\n- \"Dismissed\" - Report was determined to be invalid\n- \"Pending Edit\" - Content requires modification before publication\n- \"Escalated\" - Report has been sent to another moderator or administrator\n\nWHILE a reporter is viewing their submitted report, THE system SHALL display the current status. IF the status changes from \"Pending Review\" to \"Under Review\", THEN THE system SHALL send a notification to the reporter: \"Your report is now under review by a moderator. You will receive an update when the review is complete.\"\n\nIF the status changes to \"Approved\", THEN THE system SHALL display a message: \"Your report was accepted. The content has been removed in accordance with community guidelines. Thank you for helping to maintain a respectful community.\"\n\nIF the status changes to \"Dismissed\", THEN THE system SHALL display a message: \"Your report was reviewed but was determined to be invalid. The content does not violate community guidelines. Thank you for your contribution to the moderation process.\"\n\nIF a reporter attempts to view a report they no longer have access to (e.g., after content removal), THEN THE system SHALL display: \"This report is no longer available. The content has been removed from the platform.\"\n\n### Reporting Moderation\n\nTHE system SHALL implement mechanisms to prevent abuse of the reporting system. IF a user submits more than 5 reports within a 24-hour period, THEN THE system SHALL display a warning: \"You have submitted multiple reports. Please ensure your reports are for content that violates community guidelines. Excessive reporting may result in temporary suspension of reporting privileges.\"\n\nIF a user submits 10 or more reports within a 24-hour period, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily suspend their reporting privileges for 24 hours. IF the user submits another 5 reports within the next 24 hours, THEN THE system SHALL increase the suspension period to 72 hours and add a notification to their profile: \"Your reporting privileges have been restricted due to excessive reporting activity.\"\n\nIF a user is found to have submitted false or malicious reports, THEN THE system SHALL apply the following penalties based on severity:\n\n- First offense: Temporary suspension of reporting privileges for 7 days, notification to user\n- Second offense: Permanent suspension of reporting privileges, permanent record in user profile\n- Third offense: Account suspension for 30 days, notification to user\n- Fourth offense: Permanent account deletion\n\nThe system SHALL maintain a report abuse detection algorithm that analyzes patterns of report submissions, including:\n\n- Report-to-content ratio for each user\n- Consistency of report categories across multiple reports\n- Temporal patterns of report submission\n- Correlation between report submissions and user activity\n\nWHEN the algorithm detects suspicious behavior, THEN THE system SHALL flag the user's account for review by the global administrator.\n\n### Report Analytics\n\nTHE system SHALL collect and analyze report data to identify trends and improve platform safety. THE system SHALL generate weekly reports on the following metrics:\n\n- Total number of reports submitted\n- Report category distribution\n- Report resolution rate (percentage of reports that were approved)\n- Average time to resolve reports\n- Most reported content types (posts, comments, profiles, communities)\n- Most frequently reported users\n- Report abuse rate (percentage of reports that were for policy violations)\n- Moderator performance metrics (cases handled, resolution time, accuracy)\n\nTHE system SHALL provide a dashboard for administrators showing:\n\n- A timeline of report volume over time\n- Geographic distribution of reports (by country/region)\n- Correlation between report volume and community activity\n- Most active reporting users\n- Report success rate by category\n- Moderator workload distribution\n\nIF a report category shows increasing frequency, THEN THE system SHALL notify the platform safety team with a recommendation for community guideline review. IF report volume exceeds historical averages by 300% or more, THEN THE system SHALL trigger an automated alert to the safety team.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### Reporter User Journey\n\n1. Start: User views content they believe violates community guidelines\n2. Action: User clicks the \"Report\" button on the content\n3. Form: User selects report category, adds context, checks confirmation checkbox, and submits\n4. Validation: System validates inputs; if valid, report is submitted\n5. Confirmation: User sees confirmation message and report status\n6. Review: User returns to the reporting page to check report status\n7.

The architecture consists of the following components:\n\n- **User Interface Layer**: Displays reporting options and status updates to users\n- **Reporting Service**: Manages report lifecycle, validation, and routing\n- **Moderation Management**: Coordinates report assignment and alerting\n- **Analytics Engine**: Processes report data for metrics and trend analysis\n- **Security Module**: Handles user authentication and access control\n- **Database Layer**: Stores report records, user history, and audit trails\n\n### Data Flow\n\n1. User submits report through UI\n2. Request sent to Reporting Service\n3. Service validates inputs\n4. Service creates report record\n5. Service assigns report to appropriate moderator\n6. Status updated in database\n7. Notification sent to moderator\n8. Moderator interacts with report\n9. Service records moderator action\n10. Status updated in database\n11. Notification sent to reporter\n12. Analytics Engine collects data\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Report Lifecycle\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A["}],"created_at":"2025-10-16T09:01:45.340Z","completed_at":"2025-10-16T09:25:56.275Z","step":0}]
