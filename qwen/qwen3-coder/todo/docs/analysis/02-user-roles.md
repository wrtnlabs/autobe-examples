# Todo List Application - Functional Requirements

## Core Features

THE Todo list application SHALL provide users with the ability to create new tasks.

THE Todo list application SHALL provide users with the ability to mark tasks as completed.

THE Todo list application SHALL provide users with the ability to delete tasks.

THE Todo list application SHALL display all tasks to the user in a single list view.

THE Todo list application SHALL maintain task descriptions with a maximum length of 200 characters.

THE Todo list application SHALL track task completion status as a boolean value.

## Task Management

WHEN a user creates a new task, THE system SHALL store the task description and set its completion status to false.

WHEN a user submits a task description exceeding 200 characters, THE system SHALL reject the request and notify the user of the character limit.

WHEN a user marks a task as completed, THE system SHALL update the task's completion status to true.

WHEN a user deletes a task, THE system SHALL permanently remove the task from storage.

WHEN a user accesses the Todo list application, THE system SHALL display all existing tasks with their current completion status.

WHEN a user refreshes the Todo list view, THE system SHALL maintain the current state of all tasks.

## User Workflows

### Task Creation Workflow
1. User opens the Todo list application
2. User enters a task description in the input field
3. User submits the new task
4. System validates the task description length
5. IF validation passes, THEN system creates the task with completion status set to false
6. System displays the new task in the task list
7. User can see the newly added task with unchecked completion status

### Task Completion Workflow
1. User views the list of existing tasks
2. User locates a task they wish to mark as completed
3. User clicks or activates the completion indicator for that task
4. System updates the task's completion status to true
5. System visually indicates the task is now completed in the list view

### Task Deletion Workflow
1. User views the list of existing tasks
2. User selects a task they wish to delete
3. User confirms deletion intent through appropriate UI action
4. System permanently removes the task from storage
5. System updates the displayed task list to exclude the deleted task

## Business Rules

THE system SHALL assign a unique identifier to each task upon creation.

THE system SHALL preserve task data between user sessions without requiring authentication.

THE system SHALL display tasks in the order they were created, with newest tasks appearing last.

THE system SHALL permit task descriptions containing any printable characters including Unicode.

THE system SHALL limit each task description to 200 characters maximum.

THE system SHALL represent task completion status as a simple boolean value (true/false).

THE system SHALL not impose any daily, weekly, or monthly limits on task creation.

THE system SHALL allow users to complete and delete tasks in any order regardless of creation sequence.

## Error Handling

IF a user attempts to create a task with an empty description, THEN the system SHALL reject the request and display an appropriate error message.

IF a user attempts to create a task with more than 200 characters, THEN the system SHALL reject the request and notify the user that the description is too long.

IF the system encounters a storage failure when creating a task, THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the task could not be saved.

IF the system encounters a data corruption issue, THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover previous data or notify the user of data loss.

IF a user attempts to mark a task as completed that is already completed, THEN the system SHALL maintain the completed status without error.

IF a user attempts to delete a task that does not exist, THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the operation without error.

IF the system fails to delete a task due to storage issues, THEN the system SHALL display an error message and maintain the task in the list.
