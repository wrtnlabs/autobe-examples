### Content Sorting Algorithms

THE system SHALL provide four content sorting mechanisms:

1. Hot posts algorithm:
   - WHILE calculating hot scores, THE system SHALL use the formula: 
     Score = (Upvotes - Downvotes) / (Time since posting in hours + 2)^1.8
   - Posts SHALL be sorted by this calculated score in descending order

2. New posts algorithm:
   - THE system SHALL display posts in chronological order with newest first

3. Top posts algorithm:
   - THE system SHALL rank posts by net vote score (upvotes - downvotes)
   - WHEN displaying top posts, THE system SHALL provide time filtering:
     - Today (posts from last 24 hours)
     - This week (posts from last 7 days)
     - This month (posts from last 30 days)
     - This year (posts from last 365 days)
     - All time (all posts)

4. Controversial posts algorithm:
   - WHILE calculating controversial scores, THE system SHALL use a formula that favors posts with:
     - High absolute vote counts (upvotes + downvotes)
     - Balanced upvote/downvote ratios (close to 1:1)
   - Posts SHALL be sorted based on this controversy metric
