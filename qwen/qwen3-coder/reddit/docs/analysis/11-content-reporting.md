# Content Reporting Requirements

## Reporting Mechanism

### Core Reporting Functions

WHEN a member encounters inappropriate content, THE system SHALL provide a reporting mechanism accessible from each post and comment.

WHEN a user clicks the "Report" button on a post or comment, THE system SHALL display a modal dialog with report categories.

THE system SHALL allow users to submit reports with an optional text explanation (maximum 1000 characters).

WHEN a user submits a report, THE system SHALL validate that:
- The reporter is an authenticated member (guests cannot report)
- The reported content exists and is accessible
- A valid report category has been selected
- Any explanation text does not exceed 1000 characters

WHEN a user submits a valid report, THE system SHALL create a report record including:
- Unique report identifier
- Reporter user ID
- Reported content ID (post or comment)
- Report category selection
- Optional explanation text
- Report submission timestamp
- Report status (pending, reviewed, resolved)

WHEN a user attempts to report content they've already reported, THE system SHALL display a message indicating they've already submitted a report for that content.

### Report Categories

THE system SHALL provide the following predefined report categories:
- Spam or misleading content
- Harassment or bullying
- Hate speech or discrimination
- Violence or threats
- Personal information sharing
- Sexual content
- Illegal activities
- Other (requires explanation)

WHEN a user selects the "Other" report category, THE system SHALL require them to provide an explanation text (1-1000 characters).

### Report Processing Workflow

WHEN an admin accesses the moderation dashboard, THE system SHALL display pending reports sorted by submission timestamp (newest first).

WHEN a moderator accesses the moderation dashboard for their communities, THE system SHALL display reports related to content in those communities only.

THE system SHALL track report statistics including:
- Total reports submitted
- Reports by category
- Resolution times
- Moderator actions taken

## Moderation Workflow

### Initial Report Review

WHEN a moderator or admin reviews a pending report, THE system SHALL display:
- The reported content with full context
- Report category and explanation
- Reporter information
- Report submission timestamp

THE system SHALL prevent moderators from reviewing reports in communities they do not moderate.

WHEN a moderator determines a report is valid, THE system SHALL allow them to:
- Remove the reported content
- Issue a warning to the content author
- Temporarily ban the content author from the community
- Permanently ban the content author from the community

WHEN a moderator determines a report is invalid, THE system SHALL allow them to dismiss the report with an optional reason.

### Content Removal Actions

WHEN a moderator removes reported content, THE system SHALL:
- Mark the content as "removed by moderator"
- Hide the content from public view
- Send a notification to the content author explaining the removal
- Update the report status to "resolved"
- Log the removal action with timestamp and moderator ID

WHEN an admin permanently deletes content (rather than removing it), THE system SHALL:
- Completely remove the content from the database
- Update the report status to "resolved"
- Log the deletion action with timestamp and admin ID

### User Notifications

WHEN a user's content is removed by a moderator, THE system SHALL send them a notification within 1 minute that includes:
- Reference to the removed content
- Report category that triggered the removal
- Link to community rules that were violated
- Instructions for appealing the removal if applicable

WHEN a user's content is deleted by an admin, THE system SHALL send them a notification within 1 minute that includes:
- Reference to the deleted content
- Report category that triggered the deletion
- Information about appeal processes (if any)

## Admin Actions

### Administrative Privileges

WHERE an admin role is applied, THE system SHALL grant additional capabilities:
- Access to all reports across all communities
- Ability to permanently delete content (not just remove)
- Ability to ban users from the entire platform
- Access to detailed user activity logs
- Ability to override moderator decisions

### User Ban Management

WHEN an admin bans a user from the platform, THE system SHALL:
- Immediately invalidate all user sessions
- Prevent all login attempts from that user
- Hide all the user's existing content from public view
- Prevent the user from creating new content
- Log the ban action with timestamp, admin ID, and reason

WHEN a moderator bans a user from a community, THE system SHALL:
- Prevent the user from posting or commenting in that community
- Allow the user to continue participating in other communities
- Send a notification to the user about the community ban
- Log the ban action with timestamp, moderator ID, and reason

### Report Resolution Tracking

THE system SHALL maintain an audit trail of all report resolutions including:
- Report ID and content that was reported
- Moderator or admin who processed the report
- Action taken (content removal, user warning, user ban, dismissal)
- Resolution timestamp
- Optional resolution notes from the moderator/admin

### Escalation Procedures

IF a moderator cannot resolve a report, THEN THE system SHALL allow escalation to admin level.

WHEN a report is escalated to admin level, THE system SHALL:
- Reassign the report to admins only
- Notify relevant admins of the escalation
- Preserve all previous report information and context

### Appeal Processes

THE system SHALL allow content authors to appeal removal decisions through a dedicated appeal form.

WHEN a user submits an appeal, THE system SHALL:
- Create an appeal record linked to the original report
- Assign the appeal to an admin for review
- Send notification to the user acknowledging receipt

WHEN an admin reviews an appeal, THE system SHALL allow them to:
- Uphold the original removal decision
- Restore the removed content
- Modify the original removal action

## Error Handling and Validation

### Invalid Reporting Attempts

IF a guest attempts to report content, THEN THE system SHALL redirect them to the login page.

IF a user attempts to report non-existent content, THEN THE system SHALL display an error message: "The content you're trying to report is no longer available."

IF a user attempts to submit a report without selecting a category, THEN THE system SHALL display an error message: "Please select a report category."

IF a user submits an explanation text exceeding 1000 characters, THEN THE system SHALL display an error message: "Explanation text must be 1000 characters or less."

### Moderation Access Control

IF a moderator attempts to access reports outside their communities, THEN THE system SHALL deny access with an appropriate error message.

IF a user attempts to access moderation tools without proper permissions, THEN THE system SHALL deny access and log the attempt.

### System Limitations

THE system SHALL limit users to submitting 10 reports per hour to prevent abuse.

WHERE a user exceeds the hourly report limit, THE system SHALL display an error message and prevent further reports until the limit resets.

## Performance and Technical Requirements

### Report Processing

WHEN a user submits a report, THE system SHALL process and store it within 500 milliseconds.

THE system SHALL display new reports in the moderation dashboard within 1 second of submission.

WHEN a moderator resolves a report, THE system SHALL update report status within 200 milliseconds.

### Notification Delivery

THE system SHALL deliver moderation-related notifications within 1 minute of the triggering action during peak hours.

THE system SHALL deliver moderation-related notifications within 5 minutes during non-peak hours.

WHEN notification delivery fails, THE system SHALL retry delivery up to 3 times before marking as failed.

### Data Retention

THE system SHALL maintain report records for at least 1 year for audit purposes.

WHEN content is removed or deleted, THE system SHALL preserve the report connection for audit trails.

### Privacy and Security

THE system SHALL restrict report visibility to authorized personnel only (moderators for their communities, admins for all reports).

THE system SHALL log all report access and actions for security auditing.

IF a user account is deleted, THEN THE system SHALL preserve their reports with anonymized user references.
