# Reddit-like Community Platform Requirements Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

THE Reddit-like community platform SHALL provide users with a decentralized forum experience where they can create accounts, join topic-specific communities, share content in multiple formats, and engage with others through voting and nested commenting systems. This platform SHALL replicate core Reddit functionality while allowing for customization of community rules and content moderation approaches.

## Service Overview

### Core Features

THE system SHALL implement these primary functions:
1. User account registration and authentication with email verification
2. Community creation with customizable settings and moderation tools
3. Multi-format content posting (text, links, images) with validation
4. Voting mechanism (upvote/downvote) for posts and comments affecting user karma
5. Nested reply system for comments up to 10 levels deep
6. Content ranking algorithms (hot, new, top, controversial)
7. Community subscription system for personalized content feeds
8. User profiles displaying activity history and karma scores
9. Content reporting system with moderation workflow for inappropriate material

### Business Value

WHEN users seek specific communities for their interests, THE platform SHALL provide organized content discovery through topic-based grouping.

WHILE maintaining content quality, THE system SHALL enable community-driven moderation through voting and reporting mechanisms.

THE platform SHALL foster engagement through a karma system that recognizes valuable contributions.

WHERE users want to track discussions on topics they care about, THE subscription system SHALL create personalized feeds.

```

WHEN a member votes on content, THE system SHALL:
- Verify user authentication status
- Validate content identifier exists and is accessible
- Prevent self-voting on user's own content
- Record vote with timestamp and content association
