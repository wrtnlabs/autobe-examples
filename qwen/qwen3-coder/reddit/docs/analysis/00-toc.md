## Document Overview

This requirements analysis report provides a comprehensive specification for building a Reddit-like community platform. The platform will enable users to create accounts, form communities, share content, and engage through voting and commenting mechanisms.

The documentation is structured into specialized sections that focus on distinct functional areas of the system. Each document defines WHAT the system should do rather than HOW it should be implemented, allowing backend developers complete autonomy over technical decisions including architecture, database design, and API specifications.

The user roles defined for this system include:
- Guest: Unauthenticated users who can browse public content, register, and login
- Member: Authenticated users who can create posts, comment, vote, subscribe to communities, and manage their profiles
- Moderator: Community moderators with additional permissions to manage community content, remove posts/comments, and ban users
- Admin: System administrators with full access to manage users, communities, and handle reported content

All requirements in these documents follow the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format to ensure clarity and testability. The templates include:
- WHEN <trigger>, THE <system> SHALL <function>
- WHILE <state>, THE <system> SHALL <function>
- IF <condition>, THEN THE <system> SHALL <function>
- WHERE <feature/condition>, THE <system> SHALL <function>
- THE <system> SHALL <function>

> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**. All technical implementations (architecture, APIs, database design, etc.) are at the discretion of the development team.*
