THE system SHALL allow users to delete their own comments if they have no existing replies to the content.

WHEN a comment contains nested replies, THE system SHALL prevent direct deletion but SHALL allow editing to indicate "[deleted]" placeholder status.

THE system SHALL display comment sorting options including best, top, new, and controversial organizational methods.

### 3.6 Content Sorting Algorithms System

THE system SHALL implement four distinct content ranking algorithms:

WHEN displaying posts sorted by "Hot" algorithm, THE system SHALL use calculation formula:
- Score = Log10(Max(|upvotes - downvotes|, 1)) + Sign × TimeFactor
- Where Sign = 1 if (upvotes > downvotes), 0 if (upvotes = downvotes), -1 if (upvotes < downvotes)

WHEN displaying posts sorted by "New" algorithm, THE system SHALL organize posts in chronological sequence with newest content appearing first.

WHEN displaying posts sorted by "Top" algorithm, THE system SHALL rank posts by net vote score (upvotes minus downvotes):

WHEN displaying top posts, THE system SHALL provide these time filtering options:
- Today (posts from previous 24 hours)
- This week (posts from previous 7 days)
