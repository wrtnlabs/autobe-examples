# Product Reviews and Ratings System Requirements

## 1. Review Submission

The review submission system must allow registered customers to provide feedback on products they have purchased.

### Review Creation Process
WHEN a customer views a product detail page, THE system SHALL display a "Write Review" button if the customer has previously purchased that product.

WHEN a customer clicks the "Write Review" button, THE system SHALL present a form requesting:
- Product rating (1-5 stars)
- Review title (summary of experience)
- Detailed review content (minimum 50 characters, maximum 2000 characters)
- Optional photo uploads (maximum 5 images per review)

THE system SHALL validate that only customers who have purchased the product can submit reviews.

WHEN a customer attempts to submit a review, THE system SHALL verify the customer has a completed order for that product before accepting the review.

### Review Content Validation
THE system SHALL reject review submissions if the detailed review content contains fewer than 50 characters.

THE system SHALL verify that all review titles are between 10 and 100 characters in length.

THE system SHALL validate that star ratings must be whole numbers between 1 and 5 inclusive.

IF a customer submits multiple reviews for the same product, THEN THE system SHALL only accept the most recent review and update the previous one.

### Photo Upload Requirements
WHERE photo uploads are enabled, THE system SHALL accept only JPG, PNG, and GIF image formats.

WHERE photo uploads are included, THE system SHALL limit each image file size to 5MB maximum.

THE system SHALL resize uploaded images to standard dimensions for consistent display.

## 2. Rating System

The rating system must provide meaningful product quality indicators to potential buyers while ensuring data integrity.

### Star Rating Calculation
THE system SHALL calculate overall product ratings as the average of all approved customer star ratings, rounded to one decimal place.

THE system SHALL display the number of reviews contributing to each product's overall rating.

WHEN a customer submits a new rating, THE system SHALL recalculate the product's average rating within 1 second.

### Rating Display Requirements
THE system SHALL show star ratings visually as filled and unfilled stars.

THE system SHALL display decimal ratings as partial star fills (e.g., 4.5 stars shows 4 filled stars and one half-filled star).

### Rating Distribution
THE system SHALL track and record how many customers gave each star level (1-5 stars) for every product.

THE system SHALL make rating distribution available to admin and seller users for product performance analysis.

## 3. Review Moderation

The review moderation system must ensure platform quality while respecting customer voice.

### Automated Review Filtering
THE system SHALL automatically flag reviews containing profanity or inappropriate language for manual review.

THE system SHALL prevent duplicate review submissions based on content similarity analysis.

THE system SHALL block reviews that contain obvious spam content or promotional links.

### Manual Moderation Process
WHEN a review requires manual moderation, THE system SHALL notify admin users through the dashboard alert system.

THE system SHALL provide admin users with options to:
- Approve the review
- Reject the review with reason
- Request edits from the customer

### Review Status Management
THE system SHALL maintain three review statuses:
- Pending (awaiting approval)
- Approved (visible to all users)
- Rejected (not visible to public)

WHEN an admin approves a review, THE system SHALL make it immediately visible to all users browsing the product.

WHEN an admin rejects a review, THE system SHALL send a notification to the submitting customer explaining the rejection reason.

### Seller Review Monitoring
THE system SHALL allow sellers to view all reviews for their products in their dashboard.

THE system SHALL send email notifications to sellers when their products receive new review submissions.

THE system SHALL provide sellers with the ability to flag reviews that violate platform policies for admin review.

## 4. Review Display

The review display system must organize customer feedback in a helpful and accessible manner.

### Product Page Review Display
THE system SHALL display the three most helpful reviews on each product page by default.

THE system SHALL provide a mechanism for users to sort reviews by:
- Most recent
- Highest rated
- Lowest rated
- Most helpful

WHEN more than three reviews exist for a product, THE system SHALL provide pagination controls to access additional reviews.

### Review Organization
THE system SHALL group reviews by star rating levels for easy filtering.

THE system SHALL allow users to filter reviews by verified purchases only.

### User Review Interactions
THE system SHALL allow users to mark reviews as helpful or not helpful.

THE system SHALL track helpfulness votes and use them to determine review prominence.

IF a customer attempts to vote on their own review, THEN THE system SHALL prevent the vote and display an appropriate message.

### Reviewer Identity
THE system SHALL display only the customer's username and not their full name or contact information with reviews.

THE system SHALL indicate whether reviewers verified their purchase for each product.

## Business Rules and Validation

### Review Submission Eligibility
THE system SHALL verify that customers have "customer" role to submit reviews.

THE system SHALL prevent guests (non-logged-in users) from submitting reviews.

WHEN a customer attempts to review a product they haven't purchased, THE system SHALL display an appropriate error message.

### Rating Integrity

## Error Handling Scenarios

IF a customer submits a review without selecting a star rating, THEN THE system SHALL display an error message requesting rating selection.

IF a customer submits review content exceeding 2000 characters, THEN THE system SHALL display an error message indicating the maximum length.

IF a customer uploads a file that is not a JPG, PNG, or GIF image, THEN THE system SHALL reject the file and display an appropriate error message.

IF image uploads exceed the 5MB limit, THEN THE system SHALL reject the file and notify the customer.
