### Platform Purpose and Market Justification
The e-commerce platform serves as a digital marketplace connecting buyers with sellers to facilitate convenient online shopping experiences. This platform addresses market demand for diverse product access with reliable vendor management capabilities.

WHEN consumers seek convenient online shopping experiences, THE ecommerce platform SHALL connect them with diverse product sellers to fulfill their purchasing needs across multiple categories.

WHEN users access the platform homepage, THE system SHALL display featured products, category navigation, and user account options.

THE platform SHALL organizes products into hierarchical categories to facilitate browsing (e.g., Electronics > Smartphones > Android Phones).

### Revenue Strategy
THE platform SHALL generate revenue through:
- Transaction fees from seller sales (typically 5-15% of sale price)
- Premium seller account subscriptions with enhanced features
- Advertising revenue from featured product placements
- Monthly subscription tiers for sellers based on inventory capacity

### Growth Plan
THE platform SHALL acquire users through:
1. Social media marketing targeting online shoppers

WHEN a user clicks the verification link, THE system SHALL activates their account if the link is valid and not expired.

#### Login Requirements
WHEN a user submits login credentials through email and password, THE system SHALL authenticate their identity within 2 seconds.

WHEN authentication succeeds, THE system SHALL generates JWT tokens with appropriate role permissions and redirects to role-specific dashboard.

IF authentication fails after 3 consecutive attempts, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily locks the account for 15 minutes and notifies the user by email.

#### Session Management
THE user session SHALL remain active for 30 days of inactivity with refresh token implementation.

THE system SHALL maintains separate sessions for different devices and browsers without interference.

WHEN a user logs out actively, THE system SHALL invalidates current session tokens immediately while preserving other device sessions.

WHEN suspicious activity is detected through multiple geographic logins, THE system SHALL automatically terminates sessions and requires re-authentication.

#### Password Recovery
WHEN a user requests password reset through forgotten password link, THE system SHALL sends verification email with reset instructions to their registered address.

WHEN a user clicks password reset link, THE system SHALL allows them to set a new password if the link is valid and not expired after 24 hours.
