WHEN a user submits customer registration information, THE system SHALL validate:
- Email format matches standard email pattern
- Password is at least 8 characters with mixed case letters and numbers
- Email is not already registered in the system
- All required fields are completed

IF registration validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL display specific error messages for each failed validation criterion.

WHEN a user successfully completes registration, THE system SHALL create an account with pending verification status and send confirmation email within 1 minute.

### Login Requirements
WHEN a user submits valid email and password credentials, THE system SHALL authenticate the user and create an active session within 2 seconds.

WHEN a user submits invalid login credentials, THE system SHALL display generic authentication failure message without revealing if email exists in system.

IF a user enters invalid credentials 5 consecutive times, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 30 minutes and notify the user by email.

WHEN a user with an active session accesses protected features, THE system SHALL verify authentication status and allow access without re-authentication.

### Session Management
THE system SHALL maintain user sessions using JWT tokens with 30-minute expiration for access tokens.

THE system SHALL support refresh tokens with 30-day expiration to maintain persistent sessions.

WHEN a user accesses the platform with a valid refresh token, THE system SHALL automatically generate new access tokens without requiring re-authentication.

WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL invalidate current session tokens immediately and redirect to homepage.

WHEN session tokens expire during user activity, THE system SHALL automatically attempt refresh token renewal before prompting for re-authentication.

### Password Recovery
WHEN a user requests password reset through the login page, THE system SHALL verify the email exists in the database and send password reset link to that address within 30 seconds.

WHEN a user clicks password reset link, THE system SHALL validate the link expiration (24-hour validity) and present password change form if valid.

WHEN a user submits new password through reset form, THE system SHALL validate password complexity requirements and update account credentials.

IF password reset link is expired or invalid, THEN THE system SHALL display error message and provide option to request new reset link.

### Email Verification
WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL send verification email with unique activation link within 1 minute.

WHEN a user clicks verification link, THE system SHALL activate account if link is valid and not expired (7-day validity).

IF email verification link is expired, THEN THE system SHALL display error message with option to request new verification email.

WHEN account is successfully verified, THE system SHALL grant full platform access based on assigned user role.

## 5. Address Management System

### Address Storage
THE system SHALL allow customers to store up to 10 shipping addresses in their profile.

WHEN a customer adds a new address, THE system SHALL validate:
- Street address is provided
- City is provided
- State/region is provided
- Postal code format matches country requirements
- Country selection is valid

IF address validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL highlight specific fields with validation errors and prevent saving.

### Default Address Selection
THE system SHALL allow customers to mark one address as default for shipping.

WHEN a customer places an order without specifying shipping address, THE system SHALL use their default address automatically.

WHEN a customer updates their default address, THE system SHALL apply the change to future orders immediately.

### Address Security
WHEN customer addresses are displayed, THE system SHALL only show them to authenticated owners or authorized administrators.

THE system SHALL encrypt address information at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols.

## 6. Account Management Features

### Profile Information
THE system SHALL store customer profile information including:
- Full name
- Phone number

### Account Security
THE system SHALL require password confirmation for sensitive account changes including:
- Email address modification
- Password change
- Payment method updates
- Account deletion requests

WHEN suspicious account activity is detected, THE system SHALL temporarily suspend access and require additional verification.

### Account Status Management
THE system SHALL maintain account statuses including:
- "active" - fully functional account
- "pending_verification" - registered but email not verified
- "suspended" - temporarily restricted access
- "deactivated" - voluntarily disabled by user
- "banned" - permanently restricted access

WHEN an administrator changes account status, THE system SHALL log the action with timestamp, admin ID, and reason.

WHEN an account status changes, THE system SHALL notify the account owner by email within 5 minutes.

## 7. Role-based Access Control

### Authentication Verification
WHEN users access role-specific features, THE system SHALL verify their assigned role has appropriate permissions before granting access.

IF a user attempts to access unauthorized features, THEN THE system SHALL redirect them to appropriate role-based dashboard.

### Feature Permissions
THE system SHALL prevent customers from accessing seller dashboard functions.

THE system SHALL prevent sellers from accessing administrative functions without explicit admin role assignment.

THE system SHALL prevent unauthorized role escalation attempts through form manipulation or parameter injection.

### Data Visibility
WHEN customers access order history, THE system SHALL only display orders associated with their account.

WHEN sellers access order management, THE system SHALL only display orders for their own products.

WHEN administrators access order information, THE system SHALL allow viewing of any order in the system.

## 8. Performance and Security Standards

### Authentication Response Times
WHEN users submit login credentials, THE system SHALL respond within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.

WHEN users register new accounts, THE system SHALL complete registration process within 3 seconds.

WHEN users request password reset, THE system SHALL send reset email within 30 seconds.

### Concurrent Session Handling
THE system SHALL support up to 5 concurrent sessions per user account.

WHEN users exceed maximum concurrent sessions, THE system SHALL terminate the oldest session automatically.

### Session Security
WHEN user sessions are managed, THE system SHALL regenerate session IDs after login to prevent session fixation attacks.

THE system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on authentication endpoints (maximum 10 attempts per minute).

THE system SHALL log authentication attempts for security monitoring.

### Data Protection
THE system SHALL encrypt all passwords using bcrypt hashing with salt rounds set to 12.

WHEN personal information is transmitted, THE system SHALL use HTTPS encryption with TLS 1.3.

THE system SHALL sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## 9. Error Handling and Recovery

### Registration Errors
IF email format is invalid during registration, THEN THE system SHALL display "Please enter a valid email address" message.

IF password requirements are not met, THEN THE system SHALL display specific password complexity requirements.

IF email is already registered, THEN THE system SHALL display "An account with this email already exists" message with login option.

### Login Errors
IF credentials are invalid during login, THEN THE system SHALL display "Invalid email or password" message.

IF account is locked due to failed attempts, THEN THE system SHALL display "Account temporarily locked. Please try again later or reset password" message.

IF account is not verified, THEN THE system SHALL display "Please verify your email address" message with resend option.

### Session Errors
IF session tokens are invalid or expired, THEN THE system SHALL redirect users to login page with appropriate messaging.

IF refresh token renewal fails, THEN THE system SHALL require full re-authentication.

### Recovery Process Errors
IF password reset request uses non-existent email, THEN THE system SHALL display generic "If account exists, reset instructions sent" message for privacy protection.

IF password reset link is invalid or expired, THEN THE system SHALL display "Invalid or expired reset link" with request new link option.

IF new password doesn't meet complexity requirements, THEN THE system SHALL display specific validation errors without exposing old password.
