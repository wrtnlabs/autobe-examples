It includes automated and manual processes for reviewing posts and comments, handling user reports, and maintaining community standards.\n\n### Workflow Description\nUsers create content which flows through the moderation system based on platform settings and user privileges. Content visibility and status depend on moderation decisions and user roles.\n\n### Content Lifecycle States\n- **Draft**: Content being composed by user but not yet submitted\n- **Pending Review**: Content submitted but not yet reviewed by moderators\n- **Published**: Content approved and visible to appropriate audience\n- **Flagged**: Content reported by users awaiting moderator review\n- **Rejected**: Content that did not meet community standards\n- **Archived**: Content removed from public view but retained for records\n- **Deleted**: Content permanently removed from system\n\n## Content Approval\n\n### Automatic Approval Rules\nWHEN a user with \"member\" role creates a post in a public discussion, THE system SHALL automatically approve the content for publication within 5 seconds.\n\nWHEN a user with \"member\" role creates a comment on an already published post, THE system SHALL automatically approve the comment for publication within 3 seconds.\n\nWHEN a user with \"moderator\" or \"administrator\" role creates any content, THE system SHALL automatically approve the content for publication within 2 seconds.\n\n### Manual Review Requirements\nWHERE the platform settings require all new posts to be manually reviewed, THE system SHALL place content in \"pending review\" state and notify moderators within 10 seconds of submission.\n\nWHERE content contains keywords from the predefined filter list, THE system SHALL automatically flag the content and place it in \"pending review\" state regardless of user role.\n\nWHEN content is flagged by the automatic system, THE system SHALL notify all online moderators with permission to review content within 15 seconds.\n\n### Approval Process\nTHE system SHALL allow moderators to approve posts and comments with a single action.\n\nTHE system SHALL require moderators to provide a reason when rejecting content during the approval process.\n\nWHEN a moderator approves pending content, THE system SHALL make that content visible to all appropriate users within 5 seconds.\n\nWHEN a moderator rejects content, THE system SHALL notify the content creator of the rejection and reason within 10 seconds.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to override any moderation decision with proper justification.\n\n### Content Visibility Rules\nWHILE content is in \"pending review\" state, THE system SHALL only display it to the content creator and users with moderation privileges.\n\nWHILE content is in \"rejected\" state, THE system SHALL only display it to the content creator and users with administrative privileges.\n\nWHILE content is in \"flagged\" state, THE system SHALL maintain its current visibility but highlight it for moderator attention.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow users with \"member\" role or higher to view approved content in economic and political discussion categories.\n\n## User Management\n\n### User Status Management\nTHE system SHALL allow moderators to temporarily suspend user posting privileges for violations of community standards.\n\nTHE system SHALL require moderators to select from predefined suspension durations when suspending user accounts: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 30 days, or permanent.\n\nWHEN a moderator suspends a user account, THE system SHALL notify the user via email (if verified) of the suspension reason and duration within 1 minute.\n\nTHE system SHALL automatically restore user posting privileges after the suspension duration has elapsed.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to permanently ban users from the platform.\n\nWHEN an administrator bans a user, THE system SHALL immediately terminate all active sessions for that user.\n\n### User Role Management\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to change user roles between \"member\", \"moderator\", and \"administrator\".\n\nWHEN an administrator changes a user's role, THE system SHALL update all permissions immediately and notify the user of the change.\n\nTHE system SHALL prevent administrators from changing their own role to \"guest\" or removing their administrative privileges without another administrator present.\n\n### User Content Review\nTHE system SHALL allow moderators to review all content created by a specific user across all discussion categories.\n\nTHE system SHALL provide filtering options for reviewing user content by date range, content type (posts/comments), and moderation status.\n\nTHE system SHALL display a user's moderation history including all content decisions with timestamps.\n\n## Reporting System\n\n### Report Submission\nTHE system SHALL allow authenticated users to report posts and comments that violate community standards.\n\nTHE system SHALL require users submitting reports to select from predefined violation categories: spam, harassment, misinformation, hate speech, or other.\n\nTHE system SHALL limit guests to reporting only public content that clearly violates community standards.\n\nWHEN a user submits a report, THE system SHALL acknowledge receipt with a confirmation message within 3 seconds.\n\n### Report Management\nTHE system SHALL create a queue for all submitted reports accessible only to moderators.\n\nTHE system SHALL automatically prioritize reports based on severity and user reputation of the reporter.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow moderators to view the reported content, reporter information, and reason for report.\n\nWHEN a moderator resolves a report, THE system SHALL record the resolution action, moderator who resolved it, and timestamp.\n\nTHE system SHALL notify the reporter of report resolution status when possible.\n\n### Violation Tracking\nTHE system SHALL track the number of content violations per user and automatically escalate penalties based on recurrence.\n\nWHEN a user accumulates 3 rejected content items within 30 days, THE system SHALL automatically suspend the user for 1 day.\n\nWHEN a user accumulates 5 rejected content items within 60 days, THE system SHALL automatically suspend the user for 7 days.\n\nWHEN a user accumulates 10 rejected content items within 90 days, THE system SHALL automatically suspend the user for 30 days.\n\nIF a moderator determines that a user is deliberately attempting to violate community standards, THE system SHALL allow immediate escalation to permanent ban with administrator approval required.\n\n## Role-Based Access Controls\n\n### Guest User Permissions\nTHE system SHALL NOT allow guests to access the moderation dashboard or any administrative functions.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow guests to view public content that has been approved.\n\nTHE system SHALL restrict guests from submitting reports on content, but allow anonymous flagging through automatic systems.\n\n### Member User Permissions\nTHE system SHALL allow members to submit reports on content that violates community standards.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT allow members to access the moderation queue or resolve reports.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow members to view moderation status of their own content.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow members to appeal moderation decisions through a designated process.\n\n### Moderator Permissions\nTHE system SHALL allow moderators to access the moderation dashboard and review queues.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow moderators to approve, reject, or flag content for administrator review.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow moderators to suspend users temporarily based on content violations.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow moderators to resolve user reports within their permission scope.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT allow moderators to permanently ban users or change user roles.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT allow moderators to access administrative settings or user management beyond suspensions.\n\n### Administrator Permissions\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators full access to all moderation functions.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to permanently ban users and override any moderation decisions.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to change user roles at any level.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to access and modify all platform settings.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to view all reports and user violations.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to export audit logs for compliance purposes.\n\n## Business Rules and Validation\n\n### Content Review Workflow\nWHEN a post or comment receives 3 or more flags from different users, THE system SHALL automatically place that content in the moderator review queue with high priority.\n\nTHE system SHALL prevent users from repeatedly flagging the same content.\n\nWHERE content has been rejected more than twice by different moderators, THE system SHALL automatically escalate it for administrator review.\n\n### Decision Consistency\nTHE system SHALL require at least one moderator to review content before it can be published when manual review is enabled.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow multiple moderators to review the same content but only apply the first decision that is executed.\n\nWHEN a moderator is reviewing content, THE system SHALL lock that content for review to prevent multiple simultaneous moderations.\n\n### Automated Moderation\nTHE system SHALL automatically flag content containing predefined prohibited words or phrases.\n\nTHE system SHALL apply automatic flags based on content patterns that match known spam or harassment indicators.\n\nWHERE automated systems flag content, THE system SHALL still allow manual review by moderators before applying restrictions.\n\n### User Notification Rules\nWHEN a user's content is rejected, THE system SHALL send a notification explaining the reason using predefined categories.\n\nWHEN a user is suspended, THE system SHALL send an email notification (if available) explaining the duration and reason for suspension.\n\nTHE system SHALL provide users with an appeals process when their content is rejected or their account is suspended.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT notify content creators of individual user reports to protect reporter anonymity.\n\n## Error Handling and Edge Cases\n\n### Content Management Errors\nIF a moderator attempts to approve content that has been deleted by the user, THE system SHALL display an error message indicating content is no longer available.\n\nIF a user attempts to edit content that is currently under moderation review, THE system SHALL prevent editing and display a message that content is pending review.\n\nIF a moderator tries to access content from a deleted account, THE system SHALL still allow access to maintain content integrity.\n\n### System Performance\nWHEN processing content moderation actions, THE system SHALL complete all operations within 5 seconds under normal load.\n\nWHEN sending user notifications for moderation actions, THE system SHALL queue messages for delivery within 1 minute but not guarantee immediate delivery.\n\n### Concurrent Access\nIF multiple moderators attempt to access the same content for review simultaneously, THE system SHALL allow the first moderator to proceed and place others in a holding pattern with notification.\n\n### Data Integrity\nTHE system SHALL maintain a permanent log of all moderation actions including user ID, content ID, action taken, timestamp, and moderator who performed the action.\n\nIF a moderation decision needs to be reversed, THE system SHALL require an audit trail entry explaining the reason for reversal.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n### Scalability Requirements\nTHE system SHALL support at least 10 concurrent moderators reviewing content during peak usage periods.\n\nTHE system SHALL process and queue user reports within 2 seconds regardless of volume.\n\nTHE system SHALL maintain moderation performance with up to 1 million content items in any combined status state.\n\n### Audit and Compliance\nTHE system SHALL retain all moderation logs for a minimum of 2 years to comply with content regulation requirements.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to export moderation logs for compliance auditing.\n\nTHE system SHALL maintain anonymized statistics on moderation actions for community health analysis.\n\n### Moderation Dashboard Features\nTHE system SHALL provide moderators with a dashboard showing:\n- Pending content requiring review\n- Recent reports from users\n- User violation statistics\n- Category-specific moderation queues\n- Quick action buttons for common moderation tasks\n\nWHEN a moderator accesses the dashboard, THE system SHALL display content prioritized by:\n- Automatic flag severity\n- Report count from different users\n- Content age (older pending content gets higher priority)\n- Category activity levels\n\n### Appeal Process\nTHE system SHALL allow users to appeal moderation decisions through a dedicated form.\n\nWHEN a user submits an appeal, THE system SHALL:\n- Store the appeal with original content and moderation decision\n- Assign the appeal to an administrator for review\n- Notify the user that their appeal is being processed\n- Provide a timeline of 3-5 business days for appeal resolution\n\nTHE system SHALL maintain separate logs for appeal submissions and resolutions.\n\n### Category-Specific Moderation\nTHE system SHALL allow administrators to configure different moderation rules for economic and political categories.\n\nWHERE political discussions become heated during election periods, THE system SHALL automatically apply additional review requirements.\n\nWHEN economic discussions reference market-sensitive information, THE system SHALL flag them for expedited review.\n\n### Performance Monitoring\nTHE system SHALL track moderation performance metrics including:\n- Average time to moderate content\n- Moderator agreement rates on similar content\n- User appeal success rates\n- Report resolution times\n\nTHE system SHALL generate weekly reports for administrators on moderation team performance.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[\"User Content Creation\"] --> B{\"Content Validation\"}\n    B -->|Pass|

These rules define how content is validated, how users should behave, and the standards that govern both economic and political discussions.\n\n## Content Validation Rules\n\n### Post Content Requirements\nWHEN a member creates a new discussion post, THE system SHALL require the post to contain a title between 5 and 100 characters and body content between 10 and 5000 characters.\n\nWHEN a member submits a post, THE system SHALL validate that the post contains at least one category tag from the approved economic or political topic list.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to create a post with inappropriate language, THE system SHALL reject the submission and return an error message indicating content policy violation.\n\nWHEN a member uploads an attachment to a post, THE system SHALL limit file size to 5MB and only accept JPG, PNG, PDF, or DOC file types.\n\n### Comment Validation Standards\nWHEN a member submits a comment, THE system SHALL validate that the comment contains between 1 and 1000 characters.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to post a comment with duplicate content within the same discussion thread, THE system SHALL reject the submission with a warning about duplicate posts.\n\nWHEN a member creates a comment, THE system SHALL prevent excessive punctuation or special characters that could disrupt the user interface.\n\n### Tag and Category Validation\nTHE system SHALL maintain a predefined list of approved categories for economic discussions including: \"Macroeconomics\", \"Microeconomics\", \"Fiscal Policy\", \"Monetary Policy\", \"Trade Policy\", \"Labor Markets\", \"Financial Markets\", \"Economic Theory\", and \"Economic History\".\n\nTHE system SHALL maintain a predefined list of approved categories for political discussions including: \"Domestic Policy\", \"International Relations\", \"Legislation\", \"Electoral Politics\", \"Political Theory\", \"Public Administration\", \"Governance\", \"Civil Rights\", and \"Political History\".\n\nWHEN a user attempts to create a new category or tag, THE system SHALL reject the request and only allow administrators or moderators to manage the official category list.\n\n### Content Moderation Validation\nWHEN a member posts content, THE system SHALL automatically check for spam patterns and reject posts that match predefined spam characteristics.\n\nWHEN a member submits a post containing external links, THE system SHALL require the links to be from approved domains or flag them for moderator review.\n\nTHE system SHALL prevent users from posting content that contains personal information of other users without explicit consent.\n\n## User Behavior Guidelines\n\n### Registration and Profile Requirements\nWHEN a new user registers, THE system SHALL require a unique username, valid email address, and password that meets security criteria (minimum 8 characters with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number).\n\nWHEN a user updates their profile, THE system SHALL validate that biographical information does not exceed 500 characters and does not contain inappropriate content.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to change their username, THE system SHALL allow changes only once every 30 days to prevent identity confusion.\n\n### Posting Behavior Rules\nTHE system SHALL require all members to verify their email address before they can create posts or comments.\n\nWHEN a member posts content, THE system SHALL record the timestamp and associate it with the user's account for accountability purposes.\n\nTHE system SHALL prevent members from editing posts after 24 hours have elapsed since the original posting time.\n\nWHEN a guest views content, THE system SHALL allow browsing of public discussions but SHALL deny access to private or restricted categories.\n\n### Reputation and Activity Guidelines\nTHE system SHALL track user activity including posts created, comments made, and moderation actions received.\n\nWHEN a member accumulates more than 5 moderation strikes within 30 days, THE system SHALL automatically suspend the account for 7 days.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to excessively quote other users' content without attribution, THE system SHALL flag the behavior for potential plagiarism review.\n\nTHE system SHALL reward constructive participation through an internal reputation system that grants privileges at specific milestone levels.\n\n## Economic Discussion Standards\n\n### Content Quality Requirements\nWHEN a member posts in economic categories, THE system SHALL encourage inclusion of factual data, sources, or references to support arguments.\n\nWHEN a user submits an economic analysis post, THE system SHALL validate that monetary values are expressed clearly (specifying currency) and that economic terms are used appropriately.\n\nTHE system SHALL flag posts that make definitive economic predictions without acknowledging uncertainty or providing supporting methodology.\n\nWHEN a member creates a post about economic policy, THE system SHALL prompt the user to specify whether they are discussing theoretical, historical, or proposed policy.\n\n### Citation and Source Standards\nTHE system SHALL encourage members to cite sources when discussing economic statistics, research findings, or policy impacts.\n\nWHEN a user references economic data from government sources, THE system SHALL validate that current data is preferred over outdated information (flagging data older than 2 years).\n\nTHE system SHALL prevent users from posting economic content that misrepresents correlation as causation without appropriate caveats.\n\nWHEN a member discusses economic models, THE system SHALL flag posts that oversimplify complex economic relationships without mentioning limitations.\n\n### Discussion Formatting Guidelines\nWHEN a member posts economic analysis content, THE system SHALL support formatting features including data tables, mathematical notation, and chart embedding.\n\nTHE system SHALL prevent economic discussion posts from using misleading visual representations of data or statistics.\n\nWHEN a user creates an economic forecast discussion, THE system SHALL encourage use of ranges and confidence intervals rather than fixed predictions.\n\n## Political Discourse Requirements\n\n### Civil Discourse Standards\nWHEN a member posts in political categories, THE system SHALL enforce rules against personal attacks, hate speech, and deliberately inflammatory language.\n\nTHE system SHALL encourage respectful disagreement and evidence-based political discussion while discouraging tribalism or echo chamber behavior.\n\nWHEN a member references political figures, THE system SHALL validate that posts focus on policies and positions rather than personal characteristics.\n\n### Fact-Checking Guidelines\nTHE system SHALL flag political posts that contain verifiable factual claims without supporting evidence for moderator review.\n\nWHEN a user posts political content, THE system SHALL encourage distinction between fact, analysis, and opinion through clear labeling.\n\nTHE system SHALL prevent members from posting political misinformation that has been debunked by reputable fact-checking organizations.\n\nWHEN a member discusses election results or poll data, THE system SHALL require citation of sources and dates for the information.\n\n### Content Scope Requirements\nWHEN a user creates political content, THE system SHALL focus discussions on policy implications, governance structures, and public administration rather than personal attacks.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow political discussions that span international perspectives while respecting cultural and legal differences.\n\nWHEN members reference legislation, THE system SHALL validate that discussions cite actual legislative text or reliable reporting of proposed changes.\n\nTHE system SHALL prevent political discussions from devolving into purely partisan arguments without substantive policy analysis.\n\n## Implementation Business Rules\n\n### User Account Management\nTHE system SHALL automatically delete unverified accounts after 30 days of inactivity.\n\nWHEN a user requests account deletion, THE system SHALL anonymize their content rather than removing it completely.\n\nTHE system SHALL require email verification within 24 hours of registration to activate posting privileges.\n\n### Content Lifecycle Management\nTHE system SHALL archive discussion threads with no activity for 180 days to reduce homepage clutter.\n\nWHEN content is archived, THE system SHALL maintain all comments and replies but make the thread read-only.\n\nTHE system SHALL remove posts that violate community guidelines within 24 hours of moderator review.\n\n### Data Privacy and Retention\nWHERE users request personal data deletion, THE system SHALL remove all personally identifiable information within 30 days.\n\nTHE system SHALL retain anonymized discussion content for research and platform improvement purposes indefinitely.\n\nWHEN user accounts are permanently banned, THE system SHALL preserve content for legal compliance but disassociate it from the user's identity.\n\n### Platform Governance\nTHE system SHALL display community guidelines prominently during user registration and post creation.\n\nTHE system SHALL require users to acknowledge updated community guidelines after significant policy changes.\n\nWHEN users violate community standards, THE system SHALL implement progressive discipline including warnings, temporary suspensions, and permanent bans based on severity and repetition.\n\nWHERE discussion threads become unproductive or heated, THE system SHALL allow moderators to lock threads to prevent further comments.\n\n## Error Handling and Exception Rules\n\n### System Validation Errors\nWHEN users submit content that fails validation, THE system SHALL provide specific error messages identifying which requirements were not met.\n\nTHE system SHALL maintain a log of repeated validation failures for spam detection purposes.\n\nWHEN system errors occur during content submission, THE system SHALL preserve user content in draft form and notify administrators.\n\n### User Experience Exceptions\nIF a user attempts to access non-existent content, THE system SHALL display a user-friendly error page with navigation options to active discussions.\n\nWHERE technical issues prevent content display, THE system SHALL notify users of temporary unavailability rather than displaying blank pages.\n\nTHE system
