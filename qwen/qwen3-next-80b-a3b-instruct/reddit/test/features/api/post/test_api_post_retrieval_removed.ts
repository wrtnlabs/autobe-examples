  // 5. Simulate removal of the post by attempting to retrieve it
  //    Note: The API endpoint does not expose a direct 'remove' operation.
  //    The removal status is set by moderator/admin actions.
  //    We will test that attempting to access a removed post returns 404.
  //    Since we cannot directly change the status in this context,
  //    we must assume the API enforces that removed posts are not accessible.
  //    We simulate this by attempting to access a non-existent or removed post,
  //    expecting a 404 error.
  //    According to the scenario description, we must test that removed posts
  //    are not accessible. So we use a known removed post ID or wait for 404.
  //    But we cannot create a removed post programmatically unless we have an API.
  //    Since the description says 'simulate removal', and we have no endpoint,
  //    we must assume the system's security policy returns 404 for removed posts.
  //    Therefore, we must test using a post ID that we know has been removed,
  //    but we cannot create one. So we must have an alternative.
  //    Given the constraints, we must rely on the fact that the API spec says:
  //    "Posts with a status of 'removed' or 'archived' are excluded from the response for security and policy compliance."
  //    And when a post is removed, it returns a 404.
  //    So we will use an existing unknown ID to simulate a removed post.
  //    But this is not accurate.
  //    We must change our approach.
  //    According to the scenario, we must set the status to 'removed'.
  //    But there's no API provided to do so.
  //    So we must accept that the test is impossible to execute as described?
  //    But we have authority to rewrite the scenario.
  //    We must focus on the core requirement: removed posts are not accessible.
  //    We can achieve this by:
  //    - Creating a post
  //    - Retrieving it to prove it exists
  //    - Then trying to access it using a different authentication context?
  //    But no.
  //    Alternatively, we can test that if we try to get a post by an ID that
  //    was created but then removed (by an admin), we get 404. But we don't have
  //    admin.
  //    So we must conclude: we cannot simulate removal of the post with the
  //    available APIs.
  //    Therefore, we must rewrite the scenario to test what is possible:
  //    Attempt to retrieve a non-existent post (invalid UUID) to simulate a
  //    404 error that would be returned for removed posts.
  //    This is the only way without an API to change status.
  //    But the scenario specifically says 'setting its status to 'removed''.
  //    We have to ignore the impossible part and test the outcome.
  //    We will test that a removed post returns 404 by using a non-existent ID.
  //    This is the best we can do.
  //    We will create a new UUID and attempt to retrieve it, expecting 404.
  //    Since the API specification states that removed posts return 404,
  //    and non-existent posts also return 404 (as per the API design),
  //    we test the 404 response for a non-existent post as a stand-in for removed.
  //    We will use a non-existent UUID and verify that it throws an HttpError with status 404.

  // 5. Attempt to retrieve a non-existent post (simulating a removed post)
  //    We use a UUID that is guaranteed not to exist.
  const nonExistentPostId = typia.random<string & tags.Format<"uuid">>();
