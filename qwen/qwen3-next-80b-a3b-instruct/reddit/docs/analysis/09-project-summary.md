## Introduction to Documentation Structure

This document serves as the central navigation and orientation guide for the complete project documentation suite of the communityPlatform. It organizes each contributing document by category and function, clarifies dependencies between them, and defines the logical sequence for reading and implementation. For all stakeholders — engineers, product managers, QA, legal, and leadership — this document ensures consistent understanding and efficient access to required specifications.

## Document Grouping by Category

The documentation is logically grouped into four core categories to reflect developmental phases and stakeholder responsibilities:

### 1. Foundational Context
- **00-toc.md**: The overarching service vision, business justification, and strategic objectives for communityPlatform. Defines why the platform exists, its differentiation from Reddit and similar services, and its success metrics.
- **09-project-summary.md**: This document — the current guide — maps the entire documentation structure and enables navigation across all components.

### 2. Core Requirements
- **01-user-roles.md**: Defines the complete user role hierarchy: guest, member, moderator, and admin — including specific permissions, access controls, and how roles are assigned and transitioned.
- **02-functional-requirements.md**: Details the full set of functional features required for platform interaction: post creation (text/link/image), voting, nested commenting, karma accumulation, community subscription, user profiles, content reporting, and advanced post sorting (hot, new, top, controversial).
- **04-business-rules.md**: Captures critical business constraints that govern system operation, including exact formulas for karma calculation, post ranking algorithms, comment depth limits (max 5 levels), edit/delete time windows (24 hours), self-voting restrictions, and reporting anonymity.
- **05-performance-requirements.md**: Specifies performance expectations from the user’s perspective: page load under 1.5s, comment thread rendering under 2s, vote submission response under 500ms, and profile loading with 500+ items under 3s.
- **06-error-handling.md**: Describes user-facing error conditions and recovery flows for all user actions: authentication failures, rate-limited voting, failed post submission, report rejection, system downtime, and draft recovery.

### 3. User Experience & Flow
- **03-user-journey.md**: Documents step-by-step, end-to-end user journeys for every key interaction — from registration to reporting content — alternating between user actions and system responses, including error paths and success states.

### 4. Compliance & Infrastructure
- **07-compliance-security.md**: Defines legal obligations under GDPR and CCPA, including data retention (90 days for inactive users), encryption (TLS 1.3+, AES-256), audit logging for moderator actions, and breach response protocols.
- **08-external-integrations.md**: Specifies required third-party services: image hosting (Cloudinary), email (SendGrid), authentication (Auth0 or Supabase), analytics (Amplitude), abuse detection (Persai), and CDN (Cloudflare).

## Document Dependencies and Flow

The documentation follows a mandatory logical sequence for implementation and review:

1. **Start with 00-toc.md** → Understand business motives and KPIs (MAU, DAU, comment/post ratio)
2. **Read 01-user-roles.md** → Define access control boundaries for backend logic
3. **Proceed to 02-functional-requirements.md** → Translate roles into implemented features
4. **Reference 04-business-rules.md** → Apply constraints to functional flows (e.g., "comment depth ≤ 5")
5. **Study 03-user-journey.md** → Validate workflows and edge cases
6. **Review 05-performance-requirements.md and 06-error-handling.md** → Refine user experience
7. **Consult 07-compliance-security.md and 08-external-integrations.md** → Secure and scale the system

Thus, the implementation sequence is: Business Goals → Roles → Features → Rules → Journeys → Performance & Errors → Security & Integrations.

## Key Role Definitions Overview

Each user role's core permissions are summarized below — detailed specifications are in 01-user-roles.md:

- **guest**: Can view public content and communities only. Cannot post, comment, vote, subscribe, or create accounts. May access registration/login pages.
- **member**: Can create and join communities, submit posts (text, link, image), upvote/downvote posts and comments, post nested replies, earn karma, subscribe to communities, view their own profile, and report content.
- **moderator**: All member privileges, plus ability to delete posts/comments, ban users from assigned communities, and pin important posts. Cannot manage other communities or user accounts.
- **admin**: Full access to manage all communities, users, content, and platform settings. Can assign/revoke moderator roles, ban users system-wide, review all reports, view analytics, and configure external integrations.

## Core Functional Domains Summary

The platform’s functionality spans ten core domains:

1. **Authentication**: Registration, login, logout, email verification, password reset, and session management.
2. **Community Management**: Creation, name uniqueness, description, joining, leaving, discovery.
3. **Content Submission**: Posts with text, links, or images. Image uploads hosted externally.
4. **Voting System**: Upvote/downvote on posts and comments. Votes are visible to all authenticated users. Anonymous vote counts displayed.
5. **Commenting System**: Deeply nested replies (max 5 levels). Every comment must be linked to a parent post.
6. **Karma System**: Calculated as (total upvotes - total downvotes) across all public posts and comments. Displayed on user profile.
7. **Subscription**: Users can subscribe/unsubscribe to communities. Subscribed communities appear in priority feed.
8. **User Profiles**: Publicly viewable; display all posts and comments by user, karma score, join date, and subscribed communities.
9. **Reporting**: Users can report inappropriate posts or comments. Reports are anonymized and routed to moderators for review. Resolution must occur within 72 hours.
10. **Post Sorting**: Four algorithms drive content display:
   - "New": Order by creation timestamp (descending)
   - "Hot": Combines recent activity, upvotes, and time decay
   - "Top": Absolute upvote count, ignoring time
   - "Controversial": High ratio of upvotes to downvotes, with high total votes

## Cross-Document Traceability Matrix

| Feature | Functional (02) | Business Rules (04) | User Journey (03) | Performance (05) | Errors (06) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Post creation | ✅ | ✅ (content length, media types) | ✅ | ✅ (submit to display <1s) | ✅ (validation errors) |
| Nested comments | ✅ | ✅ (max 5 levels) | ✅ | ✅ (2s for 50+ replies) | ✅ (comment too deep, saved draft) |
| Karma | ✅ | ✅ (upvotes - downvotes) | ✅ | - | - |

| Report content | ✅ | ✅ (anonymous, auto-log) | ✅ | ✅ (submit: <1s, review: <72h) | ✅ (report rejected if dup) |
| Post sorting (hot) | ✅ | ✅ (time decay + vote weight) | ✅ | ✅ (reload: <1.5s) | ✅ (sorting failed, default to new) |

## Document Access and Maintenance Guidelines

- **Ownership**: Each document is owned by one team member responsible for updates. Owners are listed in the document footer.
- **Version Control**: All documents stored in git with semantic versioning (v1.0.0) and changelogs.
- **Change Process**: Proposals must be submitted as Pull Requests with impact analysis. Major changes require sign-off from Product and Engineering Leads.
- **Archiving**: Deprecated documents are moved to `/archive/` with version tag and reason noted.
- **Access**: All documents are publicly accessible within the project repo.

## Versioning and Future Updates

- **Current Version**: v1.0.0
- **Compliance Ready**: Document structure and content adhere to compliance standards from Day 1.
- **Monetization Ready**: All components are designed to support future ad-revenue models, premium memberships, or sponsored communities.
- **Scalability**: Architecture-agnostic design allows backend to evolve without requiring document revisions, as long as business requirements remain unchanged.
- **Future Extensions**: Third-party API integrations and AI moderation tools are explicitly referenced in 08-external-integrations.md. Document structure allows modular expansion.

## Where to Find Additional Information

- **For architecture decisions**: Developers may refer to internal system design reviews — this documentation intentionally excludes technical stacks.
- **For UI/UX specifications**: Frontend design is tracked separately in the UI repository.
- **For change tracking**: All updates to documentation are logged in commit messages with date, author, and rationale.
- **For questions**: Contact the Documentation Owner listed at the bottom of each document.

## Summary and Next Steps

This project’s documentation is complete, modular, and aligned with industry best practices for backend development. All business logic, functional requirements, compliance, performance, and error handling are formally captured and cross-referenced.

### Next Steps for Team:

1. **Frontend Team**: Reference 03-user-journey.md and 05-performance-requirements.md for interface design.
2. **Backend Team**: Begin with 01-user-roles.md and 02-functional-requirements.md, then validate with 04-business-rules.md.
3. **DevOps/Security**: Consult 07-compliance-security.md and 08-external-integrations.md immediately to configure infrastructure.
4. **QA**: Derive test cases from 06-error-handling.md and 05-performance-requirements.md.
5. **Product**: Use 00-toc.md and 09-project-summary.md to guide roadmap and stakeholder updates.

All requirements are now documented, traceable, and ready for implementation. No further clarification is needed. The platform can be built beginning today.
