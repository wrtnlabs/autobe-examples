## Page Load Time Expectations

THE communityPlatform SHALL load the main feed page (homepage) in under 1.5 seconds for users with a standard broadband connection (10 Mbps+).

THE communityPlatform SHALL load any community page (e.g., /r/technology) in under 2.0 seconds, even when displaying up to 50 posts per page.

WHEN a user navigates from the homepage to a post page (e.g., /r/technology/post/12345), THE system SHALL render the full post content and initial comment thread in under 2.5 seconds.

WHILE a user is waiting for any page to load, THE system SHALL display a skeleton loading placeholder (with approximate layout and placeholder content) to provide immediate visual feedback.

THE system SHALL prioritize critical rendering assets (HTML, CSS, essential JavaScript) to enable progressive rendering, ensuring visible content appears within 1 second.

## Post Loading and Rendering Performance

WHEN a user scrolls through a feed of posts, THE system SHALL load and render each new post as it enters the viewport with a maximum delay of 300 milliseconds.

THE system SHALL cache previously loaded posts locally in the user’s browser to avoid reloading identical content during a single session.

WHEN a user refreshes a page containing previously loaded posts, THE system SHALL use the browser cache to render existing posts instantly while simultaneously validating freshness in the background.

WHILE a post is being loaded asynchronously, THE system SHALL display a low-fidelity placeholder (text width and image aspect ratio only) to prevent layout shifts.

## Voting and Comment Submission Latency

WHEN a user clicks an upvote or downvote button, THE system SHALL acknowledge the action visually (e.g., change color, icon) within 200 milliseconds and update the vote count in the UI within 500 milliseconds.

IF a user attempts to vote again within 1 second of their previous vote, THEN THE system SHALL prevent the action and display a message: "You may only vote once every 2 seconds."

WHEN a user submits a comment, THE system SHALL respond with confirmation and render the comment in the thread within 800 milliseconds under normal network conditions.

THE system SHALL validate comment length (max 5,000 characters) and content rules on the client side before submission to reduce server round-trip failures.

## Comment Thread Loading Performance

WHEN a user opens a post containing 100+ comments, THE system SHALL load and display the first 20 top-level comments within 1.5 seconds.

WHILE a user scrolls down a comment thread, THE system SHALL load additional comment levels (nested replies) in batches of 10, each batch rendering within 400 milliseconds.

THE system SHALL support loading comment threads up to 8 levels deep without requiring a full page reload or additional API calls to retrieve earlier nesting levels.

IF a comment thread exceeds 1,000 total replies, THEN THE system SHALL display a message: "This thread has over 1,000 comments. Load more to see the full conversation." and provide a button to load the next 100 comments.

## Search and Discovery Response Time

WHEN a user types in the global search bar to find a community or post, THE system SHALL return autocomplete suggestions within 400 milliseconds as the user types.

THE system SHALL limit autocomplete suggestions to a maximum of 10 results per query to maintain performance.

WHEN a user submits a search query (e.g., "cats"), THE system SHALL display results within 1.2 seconds, sorted by relevance, even when scanning across 100,000+ posts.

THE system SHALL cache common search queries for 5 minutes to reduce database load and improve response time for repeat users.

## Report Submission and Review Lag

WHEN a user submits a content report, THE system SHALL display a confirmation message: "Thank you for reporting this content. Our moderators will review it shortly." within 300 milliseconds.

THE system SHALL log the report in the backend within 1 second of submission, regardless of network latency or user device.

WHILE reports are pending moderation, THE system SHALL hide the reported content from all non-administrative users.

WHEN a moderator responds to a report (approve, remove, ignore), THE system SHALL update the content status and notify the reporter via email within 24 hours.

## Profile Data Loading Expectations

WHEN a user visits their own profile page (e.g., /u/johnsmith), THE system SHALL load and display up to 500 of their recent posts and comments in under 3 seconds.

WHEN a user visits another user’s public profile with 5,000+ total posts, THE system SHALL load the first page of 20 items and enable infinite scrolling.

THE system SHALL paginate profile data with 20 items per page and support loading up to 200 pages without performance degradation.

WHILE profile data is loading, THE system SHALL display a placeholder avatar, username, and a horizontal loading bar indicating progress.

## Real-time Update Behavior

THE system SHALL update vote counts on posts and comments in real time for the current user only — no WebSocket connection to other users is required.

WHILE a user is viewing a page with active voting or commenting activity, THE system SHALL poll the server every 15 seconds to update local vote counts and comment counts.

IF a post or comment receives a new vote or reply while the user is viewing it, THEN THE system SHALL update only the affected UI element (e.g., upvote counter, comment list) without refreshing the entire page.

THE system SHALL NOT push real-time notifications to users unless explicitly subscribed through email or push notification settings.

## Concurrency Requirements

THE system SHALL support 500 concurrent users viewing the same popular community (e.g., /r/news) without performance degradation.

WHEN 100+ users simultaneously vote on the same post within a 3-second window, THE system SHALL process each vote sequentially and ensure accurate final counts without race conditions or data corruption.

WHEN 50+ users comment on the same post within 10 seconds, THE system SHALL handle each submission with a queue-based processing system to prevent timeouts or server overload.

THE system SHALL support up to 10,000 concurrent users across the entire platform without server-side degradation, using horizontal scaling and load balancing.

## Timeout and Retry Behavior

IF a request to vote, comment, or submit a post times out after 5 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL display a message: "Your action couldn’t be completed. Please check your connection and try again."

WHEN a network request fails (status 5xx or timeout), THE system SHALL attempt up to 2 automatic retries with exponential backoff (1s, 3s).

IF all retry attempts fail, THEN THE system SHALL allow the user to manually retry the action via a "Try Again" button.

WHEN a draft post or comment is interrupted by network failure, THE system SHALL auto-save the text locally and restore it when the user returns to the page, up to 24 hours.

WHILE a user is offline, THE system SHALL store any attempted actions (votes, comments, reports) in browser storage and attempt transmission when connectivity is restored.
