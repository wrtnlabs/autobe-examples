/**
 * Creates a temporary guest account with limited read-only access to public
 * content.
 *
 * This API operation creates a temporary guest account for users who have not
 * registered or logged in. The system generates a unique guest identifier
 * (UUID) and assigns it to the guest user entity, creating a temporary session
 * that persists across page views. This functionality enables users to browse
 * public communities, view posts, and explore platform content without
 * providing any personal credentials. Upon successful creation, a time-limited
 * JWT access token is issued with a scope restricted to read-only operations on
 * public entities. The guest account is not associated with any authentication
 * credentials and will expire after a short session timeout period. This design
 * aligns with the business requirement that guests have minimal access rights
 * while maintaining platform security by preventing permanent anonymous access.
 * The operation is implemented by creating a record in the
 * community_platform_guest table, which captures the session initiation
 * timestamp, IP address, and user agent information for security analytics and
 * abuse detection. Since guests are unauthenticated by design, there are no
 * password fields or email verification requirements associated with this
 * process.
 *
 * The implementation leverages the community_platform_guest table to store the
 * ephemeral session state. The generated guest ID becomes the unique identifier
 * for all subsequent guest interactions during the session. The JWT token
 * issued contains only the guest ID as a claim with no role assignments beyond
 * guest status, ensuring no elevated privileges are granted. Tokens are signed
 * with a short lifespan (typically 15 minutes) and are not refreshable, as per
 * the security requirements for temporary access. This approach satisfies the
 * business rule that guests cannot interact with the platform (post, comment,
 * vote, subscribe) while preserving their ability to browse public content.
 *
 * From a business context perspective, this operation supports the platform's
 * mission by allowing potential users to explore the community ecosystem before
 * committing to registration. It aligns with the success metric of
 * guest-to-member conversion rate by providing a frictionless pathway for
 * initial content exploration. The operation respects the principle that
 * authentication is required for interaction, while providing sufficient access
 * to demonstrate platform value. Security considerations are paramount: no
 * personal data is collected, no authentication credentials are stored, and
 * sessions are purged automatically.
 *
 * The implementation is tightly constrained by the schema: the system can only
 * use the fields present in the community_platform_guest table (id, created_at,
 * ip_address, user_agent, last_active). No additional fields can be used since
 * they don't exist in the schema. This operation is fundamentally different
 * from member registration (join) as it does not require email, password, or
 * username verification. Related authentication operations include the guest
 * refresh operation, but there is no login operation because guests have no
 * credentials to authenticate against.

/**
 * Extends temporary guest session by renewing the access token without
 * authentication.
 *
 * This API operation refreshes an existing temporary guest session by issuing a
 * new time-limited JWT access token. The system validates the presence of a
 * valid guest access token in the Authorization header and verifies that the
 * associated guest entity exists in the community_platform_guest table with an
 * active session state. Upon confirmation, a new token is generated with an
 * extended expiration time, extending the guest's capability to access public
 * content. This operation is essential for maintaining uninterrupted browsing
 * experiences during extended sessions while adhering to the security principle
 * than guest sessions are temporary and not refreshable indefinitely.
 *
 * The implementation strictly adheres to the guest session model defined in the
 * Prisma schema. The system references the existing guest_id from the incoming
 * token and confirms the record's existence in the community_platform_guest
 * table using the id field as the primary identifier. The last_active timestamp
 * is updated to reflect the refresh operation, ensuring session activity
 * records are maintained for abuse detection and analytics purposes. The
 * refresh operation does not create a new guest account, does not modify any
 * user-supplied information (as none exists), and has no interaction with
 * authentication credentials since guests are anonymous by design. The token
 * refresh mechanism is implemented with a short maximum session lifespan
 * (typically 2 hours total) that cannot be extended beyond this limit even with
 * multiple refresh calls.
 *
 * From a business context perspective, this operation supports the guest
 * exploration experience by preventing users from being logged out during
 * prolonged browsing sessions while still enforcing the platform's security
 * model that guests have ephemeral, temporary access. It aligns with the user
 * journey where guests may spend significant time exploring communities before
 * deciding to register. The operation is constrained to the schema fields
 * available in community_platform_guest table (id, created_at, ip_address,
 * user_agent, last_active) - no additional fields can be referenced since they
 * don't exist. Security considerations are paramount: the refresh operation
 * cannot be used to extend access indefinitely, cannot be used to elevate
 * privileges, and cannot be exploited since guest sessions are automatically
 * purged after the maximum timeframe. Related operations include the guest join
 * operation which initiates the session, and there is no login operation as
 * guests do not authenticate with credentials.
