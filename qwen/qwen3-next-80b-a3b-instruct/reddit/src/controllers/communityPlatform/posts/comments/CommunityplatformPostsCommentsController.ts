  /**
   * Retrieve a specific comment by its ID within a post.
   *
   * Retrieve a specific comment by its unique identifier within a post. This
   * operation targets the community_platform_comments table in the database,
   * returning the full details of a single comment including its content, vote
   * count, creation timestamp, and moderation status. The comment must be
   * associated with the specified post via the community_platform_post_id
   * foreign key relationship and must have a status of 'published' to be
   * returned. Comments with status 'removed', 'archived', or 'unreviewed' are
   * excluded from results and will return a 404 error.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring that only authenticated users can
   * retrieve comments, although visibility of the comment is based on its
   * moderation status rather than user permissions. The operation does not
   * require any special role privileges beyond authentication, as comment
   * content is generally public-facing. The response includes the comment's
   * depth_level, which determines its visual nesting in the thread, and its
   * updated_at timestamp to reflect any recent edits.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the community_platform_comments table as
   * defined in the Prisma schema, incorporating all available comment fields
   * and relationships. The implementation follows the business rule that
   * comment content cannot be edited after 10 minutes, so the updated_at field
   * may be identical to the created_at field for older comments. This endpoint
   * is typically called after a user navigates to a specific comment from a
   * post listing or from an external link, making fast response time critical
   * for user experience.
   *
   * Related API operations include PATCH /posts/{postId}/comments to retrieve a
   * paginated list of comments for a specific post, and DELETE
   * /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId} to remove a comment (only permitted
   * for authors or moderators). Error handling follows the platform-wide
   * pattern, returning 404 for non-existent or inaccessible comments and 403
   * for unauthorized access.
   *

  /**
   * Search and retrieve a paginated, filtered list of comments for a post.
   *
   * Retrieve a paginated, filtered, and sorted list of comments associated with
   * a specific post. This operation targets the community_platform_comments
   * table in the database and supports complex querying to filter comments by
   * moderation status, sort by creation date or vote count, and paginate
   * results with customizable page sizes. The operation returns only comments
   * with status 'published', excluding those with 'removed', 'archived', or
   * 'unreviewed' statuses. This ensures users only see finalized, approved
   * content.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring that only authenticated users can
   * request comments, although the visibility of comments themselves is
   * determined by their moderation status rather than the requesting user's
   * role. The operation supports sorting by created_at (descending) for a
   * 'newest first' view, or vote_count (descending) for a 'most popular' view,
   * aligning with business rules that promote high-quality discussion. The
   * limit parameter defaults to 20 comments per page (matching client-side
   * loading patterns) and can be increased up to a maximum of 50 to prevent
   * performance degradation.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the community_platform_comments table as
   * defined in the Prisma schema, incorporating all available comment fields
   * and relationships. The response returns a paginated structure with metadata
   * including total count, current page, and page size, optimized for efficient
   * client-side rendering. Related API operations include GET
   * /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId} to retrieve a single comment by ID and
   * POST /posts/{postId}/comments to create a new comment within the post.
   * Implementation follows the platform-wide constraint that comment depth is
   * limited to a maximum of 8 levels as defined in
   * community_platform_platform_settings.max_comment_depth, but this operation
   * does not filter by depth level itself.

   * @param connection
