  /**
   * Register a new member account by creating a record in the
   * community_platform_member table with provided email, username, and
   * password_hash.
   *
   * This API operation handles user registration (join) for member accounts on
   * the communityPlatform. When a user submits registration details, the system
   * validates the email and username for uniqueness against the
   * community_platform_member table, ensures the password meets complexity
   * requirements (min 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, digit), and creates a
   * new record in the community_platform_member table with is_verified set to
   * false. The password is securely hashed using bcrypt before storage in the
   * password_hash column. A verification token is generated and stored in the
   * community_platform_email_verifications table linked to the new member's ID.
   * The operation creates an initial record in the community_platform_member
   * table with default values for created_at, updated_at, deleted_at (null),
   * and karma (0). This operation does not invoke any authentication tokens
   * directly but sets the foundation for subsequent login and refresh
   * operations by establishing the member's identity in the database.
   *
   * The implementation is constrained by the community_platform_member table
   * structure which contains precisely the required fields: email, username,
   * password_hash, is_verified, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at, and karma.
   * The operation must not attempt to populate fields not present in the schema
   * such as phone_number, first_name, or last_name. The email and username
   * fields have unique constraints which the operation must respect and
   * validate against. The password_hash field is mandatory and must be
   * populated through server-side hashing. The email_verifications table
   * referenced for token storage is linked to community_platform_member through
   * member_id foreign key, requiring the new member to be created first before
   * token generation.
   *
   * This registration flow is critical to the member role's authentication
   * chain. Without successful registration, members cannot subsequently log in,
   * refresh tokens, or access any authenticated features of the platform. The
   * action is irreversible from the user perspective (no self-deletion of
   * accounts), and the created_at timestamp establishes the account's birthdate
   * for lifetime value calculations. The member_count in
   * community_platform_communities is not directly affected by this operation;
   * it is only incremented when the user subscribes to a community in a
   * separate process.
   *
   * The operation is intentionally stateless with no side effects on other
   * tables beyond community_platform_member and
   * community_platform_email_verifications. It does not trigger profile
   * creation, karma calculation, notification preferences, or stripe customer
   * creation - those are handled by separate operations triggered after
   * successful verification. This separation ensures a clear authentication
   * boundary and prevents accidental data pollution during registration.
   *
   * The operation is publicly accessible and requires no authentication, though
   * it is subject to rate limiting as defined in
   * community_platform_platform_settings.max_posts_per_hour (though this
   * setting applies to posts, not registration). The operation uses the email
   * and username to uniquely identify accounts and prevent duplicate
   * registrations. All failures return appropriate error codes (400 for
   * validation failures, 409 for duplicate data) rather than attempting to
   * recover or auto-resolve conflicts.

   * @param body Request payload for member registration containing email,
   *   username, and password.

  /**
   * Authenticate a member user and issue access/refresh JWT tokens based on
   * email and password verification from the community_platform_member table.
   *
   * This API operation handles user login for member accounts on the
   * communityPlatform. When a user submits their email and password, the system
   * retrieves the corresponding community_platform_member record and validates
   * the password_hash against the provided password using bcrypt comparison.
   * The system verifies that the account is active by ensuring deleted_at is
   * null and that email verification is complete (is_verified is true). Upon
   * successful validation, the system generates a short-lived access token
   * (15-minute expiration) and a refresh token (7-day expiration), both stored
   * in hashed form in the community_platform_user_sessions table with the
   * member's ID, IP address, and user agent. The user agent and IP are used for
   * security monitoring in the community_platform_security_logs table. The
   * operation returns a response containing the access token, refresh token,
   * and member's ID, which constitutes the ICommunityPlatformMember.IAuthorized
   * response type.
   *
   * The operation is constrained by the fields in the community_platform_member
   * table. It requires email to identify the account and password_hash to
   * validate credentials. The system does not infers or uses any other fields
   * that are not part of the schema such as last_login_at, login_count, or
   * device_id, despite these being common in other systems. The verification
   * status (is_verified) is checked to ensure only verified accounts can log
   * in, preventing access to unverified registrations. The operation does not
   * increment a login counter or update the updated_at timestamp in the member
   * table as these are not schema-defined fields.
   *
   * This login flow enables the member role to access protected resources.
   * Without successful login, none of the member-specific operations (posting,
   * commenting, voting) are accessible. The authentication tokens are protected
   * by being stored only in HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies, as
   * referenced in the security requirements. The login operation is subject to
   * rate limiting based on
   * community_platform_platform_settings.max_posts_per_hour, which is extended
   * to authentication attempts for security. Failures return appropriate error
   * codes (401 for invalid credentials, 403 for non-verified accounts) rather
   * than providing account enumeration hints.
   *
   * The operation uses the community_platform_member table's unique constraints
   * on email to ensure precise user identification. Each successful login
   * creates a new session record in community_platform_user_sessions with a
   * unique session ID, refresh_token_hash, access_token_hash, and corresponding
   * timestamps, with support for the device_type classification. The operation
   * does not directly interact with any other tables than
   * community_platform_member and community_platform_user_sessions. Password
   * reset capability is handled by a separate operation (not this one) and
   * requires a different flow entirely.

  /**
   * Refresh expired access token using a valid refresh token from
   * community_platform_user_sessions, issuing a new access/refresh token pair
   * for continued authentication.
   *
   * This API operation handles token refresh for member accounts on the
   * communityPlatform. When a member's short-lived access token expires (after
   * 15 minutes), they can submit their refresh token to this endpoint to obtain
   * a new access token without requiring re-authentication. The system
   * validates the provided refresh token against the refresh_token_hash stored
   * in the community_platform_user_sessions table corresponding to the member's
   * ID. The system checks that the session's is_active flag is true and the
   * session_expiry hasn't been reached (7 days). If validation succeeds, a new
   * access token is generated with 15-minute expiration and a new
   * refresh_token_hash is generated (replaced) with 7-day expiration that is
   * stored in the same community_platform_user_sessions record. The existing
   * session's updated_at timestamp is refreshed. The response contains the new
   * access token and the new refresh token, forming the
   * ICommunityPlatformMember.IAuthorized type.
   *
   * The operation is constrained by the community_platform_user_sessions table
   * schema, which contains refresh_token_hash and is_active fields that are
   * critical for validation. The operation does not rely on or verify any
   * fields outside the schema such as device_id, location, or last_ping. The
   * refresh token is not renewed after every use but has a fixed lifetime (7
   * days) and the operation allows only one active session per member (the
   * refresh token is rotated on each use). The old refresh_token_hash is
   * immediately invalidated, ensuring session uniqueness and security. The
   * operation does not update the member table (community_platform_member) or
   * trigger any other side effects like notification or audit logging beyond
   * what is mandated by schema references.
   *
   * This refresh flow is critical to the member role's session management.
   * Without this operation, users would need to re-authenticate frequently,
   * which would degrade the user experience. The refresh token stored in cookie
   * is protected by HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict attributes as defined in
   * security requirements. The operation accepts the refresh token exclusively
   * in the cookie header and does not allow it in request headers or body to
   * prevent interception. Failure to validate the refresh token produces a 401
   * Unauthorized response, which triggers client-side login redirection. The
   * session record in community_platform_user_sessions is used to determine
   * token validity and does not reference any other tables for this operation.
   * The refresh logic does not interact with password_resets or
   * email_verifications tables as those are unrelated to session management.
