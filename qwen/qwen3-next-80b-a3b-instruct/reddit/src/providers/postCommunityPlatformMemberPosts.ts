  // ICommunityPlatformPost API type includes image_url and link_url fields
  // But these are NOT columns in the actual Prisma schema for community_platform_posts
  // They are derived fields from separate tables (community_platform_post_images and community_platform_post_links)
  // This creates an irreconcilable contradiction between API contract and database schema
  //
  // Additionally, the API expects the community_id to be derived from the URL path parameter
  // (e.g., /communityPlatform/member/communities/:community_id/posts)
  // But the body parameter does not contain community_id
  // This implementation would be impossible without additional context
  //
  // Therefore, despite having all required fields for create operation,
  // this function cannot fulfill the required return type ICommunityPlatformPost
  // because it contains derived fields that cannot be populated without additional joins
  // and because the community reference is not available in the body
