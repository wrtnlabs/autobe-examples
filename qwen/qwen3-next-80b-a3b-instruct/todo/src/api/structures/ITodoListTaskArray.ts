/**
 * Array of todo list tasks with all details for display in the user interface.
 *
 * This type represents a collection of all todo list tasks belonging to the
 * single user.
 *
 * Each task in the array follows the ITodoListTask schema definition,
 * containing all properties: id, todo_list_user_id, title, completed,
 * created_at, and updated_at.
 *
 * The tasks are ordered by creation time (newest first) with completed tasks
 * moved to the bottom of the list.
 *
 * This array type is used as the response body for the GET /todoList/tasks
 * endpoint, providing the complete task list to the client.
 *
 * The property name 'ITodoListTaskArray' follows the naming convention for
 * arrays, replacing the special characters [] with 'Array' to maintain schema
 * compatibility and avoid invalid type names.
 *
 * The description references the relationship between this response and the
 * todo_list_task table in the Prisma schema, ensuring developers understand
 * this is a direct representation of database records without additional
 * transformation.
