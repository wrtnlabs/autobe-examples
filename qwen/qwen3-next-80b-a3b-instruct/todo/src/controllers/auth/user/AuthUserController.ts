   * Creates a new user account for the Todo List application to establish a

   *
   * This API operation handles user registration for the Todo List application.
   * The system operates as a single-user personal application where no
   * authentication is required, but a persistent identity mechanism is needed
   * to maintain task data between sessions. When a user first accesses the
   * application, this operation creates a new todo_list_user record with a
   * system-generated UUID and timestamps. The user's identity is maintained
   * through a JWT token issued upon successful registration, which contains the
   * user ID in its payload. The operation uses the todo_list_user table from
   * the Prisma schema, which defines fields for id (UUID), created_at, and
   * updated_at, but does not include any authentication fields such as email,
   * password, or username, as these are not part of the application design. The
   * registration process is designed to be transparent to the user, occurring
   * automatically when the application is first loaded, with no user-facing
   * registration form or interaction required.
   *
   * The system implements an implicit identity model where the user's identity
   * is tied to their browser device, with no external login or credential
   * collection. The todo_list_user table maintains the single user record, and
   * the registration operation ensures this record exists and is properly
   * initialized. Since the schema has no password or credential fields, the
   * application does not implement any credential validation or secure storage
   * mechanisms.
   *
   * The JWT token returned includes the user ID in the payload and is stored in
   * browser localStorage to maintain session state. This allows the application
   * to restore the user context upon subsequent visits without prompting for
   * authentication. The operation does not create, modify, or validate any user
   * credentials as none are defined in the schema.
   *
   * The implementation aligns with the business requirements that specify a
   * single-user system with no authentication mechanism, using the
   * todo_list_user table to maintain a persistent identifier for the user. No
   * password reset, email verification, or account management operations are
   * supported or needed, as these features are explicitly excluded from the
   * system design.

  /**
   * Issues a new JWT token to maintain the device-bound user session for the
   * Todo List application without requiring user credentials.
   *
   * This API operation handles user authentication for the Todo List
   * application, serving as a token renewal mechanism rather than traditional
   * credential-based login. Although the application is designed as a
   * single-user system without password, email, or username authentication,
   * this operation provides session management by issuing a new JWT token when
   * the user opens the application. The operation confirms the existence of a
   * todo_list_user record in the database using the user's device/browser
   * identifier, which is persisted in localStorage. The todo_list_user schema
   * only contains id, created_at, and updated_at fields, with no password,
   * email, or authentication-related columns, which aligns with the business
   * requirement of having no authentication mechanism.
   *
   * Integration with the Prisma schema requires no credential validation, as
   * the system relies on the existence of a user record rather than any
   * security credentials. The login operation does not validate passwords or
   * collect user input, since the schema does not contain fields like
   * password_hash, email_verified, or authenticator_secret. Instead, it simply
   * ensures the user's identity record exists and issues a JWT token containing
   * the user ID from the existing todo_list_user record.
   *
   * This operation exists to maintain consistent API patterns and to provide
   * the client with a current authentication token. All authentication logic
   * happens on the client side in localStorage; this backend operation simply
   * responds with a new token when requested. The operation has no requirement
   * for external input, and all validation occurs by verifying the existence of
   * the user's device-bound record in the database.
   *
   * The implementation follows the business model where identity is
   * device-bound and session management is automated. No authentication flows
   * involving passwords, email verification, or security questions are
   * supported, as the schema lacks fields for these features. This operation
   * ensures that even though there's no user authentication in the traditional
   * sense, the application maintains consistent API contracts for client-side
   * authentication logic.

  /**
   * Refreshes the user's access token by validating the client-provided refresh
   * token against an existing todo_list_user identity.
   *
   * This API operation handles token refresh for the Todo List application's
   * authentication system. The system operates as a single-user personal
   * application with no traditional authentication mechanismâ€”no passwords,
   * emails, or credentials are collected or stored. The refresh functionality
   * is implemented as a client-side session persistence mechanism, where the
   * user's browser maintains a refresh token in localStorage. This operation
   * receives this refresh token from the client, validates its association with
   * a todo_list_user record in the database, and issues a new access token.
   *
   * The Prisma schema for todo_list_user contains only id, created_at, and
   * updated_at fields, with no column for storing refresh tokens, refresh token
   * expiration, or any authentication-related data. Therefore, the refresh
   * operation cannot validate refresh tokens against database-stored values as
   * in traditional authentication systems. Instead, it treats the refresh token
   * received from the client as a linked identifier for the user's session,
   * trusting the client's persistence of the token as proof of identity. The
   * implementation relies on the fact that the user has a todo_list_user record
   * (created during join/login) and matches this record with the user ID
   * embedded in the refresh token.
   *
   * The operation works by extracting the user ID from the refresh token that
   * the client presents, verifying that a todo_list_user with that ID exists in
   * the database, and then issuing a new access token. Since there are no
   * refresh token storage columns in the schema, the system assumes that the
   * client's refresh token has not been tampered with and that the user's
   * identity is correctly maintained through the browser's localStorage. The
   * refresh operation does not check expiration dates, token usage counts, or
   * other security measures because these features are unsupported by the
   * Prisma schema and are outside the scope of the minimal application design.
   *
   * The implementation follows the business requirement of a single-user,
   * no-authentication system while maintaining API consistency for client-side
   * authentication logic. As the schema lacks any authentication-specific
   * fields, the refresh mechanism is a formality that provides the application
   * with consistent token renewal patterns without any actual credential
   * validation.
