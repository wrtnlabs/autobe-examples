{"operations":[{"specification":"Authentication operation for user registration. Creates a new user account with a system-generated ID. This operation is public and does not require prior authentication, as the system is designed as a single-user application with no authentication mechanism. The operation returns a JWT token that contains the user's ID in the payload for client-side recognition. The operation corresponds to the todo_list_user entity in the Prisma schema, which contains id, created_at, and updated_at fields, but does not include username, email, or password fields.","authorizationType":"join","description":"This API operation handles user registration for the Todo List application. The system operates as a single-user personal application where no authentication is required, but a persistent identity mechanism is needed to maintain task data between sessions. When a user first accesses the application, this operation creates a new todo_list_user record with a system-generated UUID and timestamps. The user's identity is maintained through a JWT token issued upon successful registration, which contains the user ID in its payload. The operation uses the todo_list_user table from the Prisma schema, which defines fields for id (UUID), created_at, and updated_at, but does not include any authentication fields such as email, password, or username, as these are not part of the application design. The registration process is designed to be transparent to the user, occurring automatically when the application is first loaded, with no user-facing registration form or interaction required.\n\nThe system implements an implicit identity model where the user's identity is tied to their browser device, with no external login or credential collection. The todo_list_user table maintains the single user record, and the registration operation ensures this record exists and is properly initialized. Since the schema has no password or credential fields, the application does not implement any credential validation or secure storage mechanisms.\n\nThe JWT token returned includes the user ID in the payload and is stored in browser localStorage to maintain session state. This allows the application to restore the user context upon subsequent visits without prompting for authentication. The operation does not create, modify, or validate any user credentials as none are defined in the schema.\n\nThe implementation aligns with the business requirements that specify a single-user system with no authentication mechanism, using the todo_list_user table to maintain a persistent identifier for the user. No password reset, email verification, or account management operations are supported or needed, as these features are explicitly excluded from the system design.","summary":"Creates a new user account for the Todo List application to establish a persistent device-bound identity without requiring user credentials.","parameters":[],"requestBody":null,"responseBody":{"description":"Returns a JWT token that contains the user's ID in the payload for client-side identity recognition in the single-user Todo List application.

This operation validates the existing todo_list_user identity by returning a new JWT token after confirming the user's browser/device identity.

The operation corresponds to the todo_list_user entity in the Prisma schema, which has id, created_at, and updated_at fields but no authentication credentials.","authorizationType":"login","description":"This API operation handles user authentication for the Todo List application, serving as a token renewal mechanism rather than traditional credential-based login. Although the application is designed as a single-user system without password, email, or username authentication, this operation provides session management by issuing a new JWT token when the user opens the application. The operation confirms the existence of a todo_list_user record in the database using the user's device/browser identifier, which is persisted in localStorage. The todo_list_user schema only contains id, created_at, and updated_at fields, with no password, email, or authentication-related columns, which aligns with the business requirement of having no authentication mechanism.\n\nIntegration with the Prisma schema requires no credential validation, as the system relies on the existence of a user record rather than any security credentials. The login operation does not validate passwords or collect user input, since the schema does not contain fields like password_hash, email_verified, or authenticator_secret. Instead, it simply ensures the user's identity record exists and issues a JWT token containing the user ID from the existing todo_list_user record.\n\nThis operation exists to maintain consistent API patterns and to provide the client with a current authentication token. All authentication logic happens on the client side in localStorage; this backend operation simply responds with a new token when requested. The operation has no requirement for external input, and all validation occurs by verifying the existence of the user's device-bound record in the database.\n\nThe implementation follows the business model where identity is device-bound and session management is automated. No authentication flows involving passwords, email verification, or security questions are supported, as the schema lacks fields for these features. This operation ensures that even though there's no user authentication in the traditional sense, the application maintains consistent API contracts for client-side authentication logic.","summary":"Issues a new JWT token to maintain the device-bound user session for the Todo List application without requiring user credentials.","parameters":[],"requestBody":null,"responseBody":{"description":"Returns a JWT token that contains the user's ID in the payload for client-side identity recognition in the single-user Todo List application.

This operation extends the validity of the user's session by issuing a new JWT token using a valid refresh token. The refresh mechanism is implemented as a client-side persistence mechanism tied to the todo_list_user in the Prisma schema, which has only id, created_at, and updated_at fields but no refresh token storage capability. The operation uses the user's stored client-side token to validate identity.","authorizationType":"refresh","description":"This API operation handles token refresh for the Todo List application's authentication system. The system operates as a single-user personal application with no traditional authentication mechanism—no passwords, emails, or credentials are collected or stored. The refresh functionality is implemented as a client-side session persistence mechanism, where the user's browser maintains a refresh token in localStorage. This operation receives this refresh token from the client, validates its association with a todo_list_user record in the database, and issues a new access token.\n\nThe Prisma schema for todo_list_user contains only id, created_at, and updated_at fields, with no column for storing refresh tokens, refresh token expiration, or any authentication-related data. Therefore, the refresh operation cannot validate refresh tokens against database-stored values as in traditional authentication systems. Instead, it treats the refresh token received from the client as a linked identifier for the user's session, trusting the client's persistence of the token as proof of identity. The implementation relies on the fact that the user has a todo_list_user record (created during join/login) and matches this record with the user ID embedded in the refresh token.\n\nThe operation works by extracting the user ID from the refresh token that the client presents, verifying that a todo_list_user with that ID exists in the database, and then issuing a new access token. Since there are no refresh token storage columns in the schema, the system assumes that the client's refresh token has not been tampered with and that the user's identity is correctly maintained through the browser's localStorage. The refresh operation does not check expiration dates, token usage counts, or other security measures because these features are unsupported by the Prisma schema and are outside the scope of the minimal application design.\n\nThe implementation follows the business requirement of a single-user, no-authentication system while maintaining API consistency for client-side authentication logic. As the schema lacks any authentication-specific fields, the refresh mechanism is a formality that provides the application with consistent token renewal patterns without any actual credential validation.","summary":"Refreshes the user's access token by validating the client-provided refresh token against an existing todo_list_user identity.","parameters":[],"requestBody":null,"responseBody":{"description":"Returns a JWT token that contains the user's ID in the payload for client-side identity recognition in the single-user Todo List application.

This functionality enables users to mark tasks as incomplete after they've been completed if circumstances change. The operation is designed to be used with the single-user identity model where all tasks belong to one implicit user bound to the browser session.\n\nSecurity is enforced at the application level: only tasks belonging to the currently active user session can be modified, enforced by the client-side implementation which only sends task IDs from tasks loaded into the user's local context.
