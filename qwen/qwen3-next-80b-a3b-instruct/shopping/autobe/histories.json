Consumers face inconsistent product discovery, limited seller interaction, and opaque shipping and refund processes. Sellers struggle with high platform fees, limited control over their inventory and customer relationships, and lack of tools to manage orders and analytics effectively. Admins operate reactively, without centralized control over fraud, account integrity, or system performance.\n\nThis platform solves these problems by creating an integrated marketplace where:\n- Customers have a unified experience for discovering, purchasing, and receiving products with transparent tracking and recourse.\n- Sellers can independently manage their catalogs, inventory, orders, and customer communications without platform interference.\n- Administrators can oversee quality, trust, and system-wide health with governance controls.\n\n## Solution Summary\n\nShoppingMall is a multi-role e-commerce platform that connects customers, sellers, and administrators in a seamless, trust-based ecosystem. Customers browse categories, search products with variants (SKUs), add items to cart or wishlist, complete purchases with secure payment, track shipments, and leave authentic reviews. Sellers onboard via admin approval, manage their own products and inventory per SKU, fulfill orders, respond to reviews, and view sales analytics. Administrators verify sellers, moderate content, resolve disputes, override orders, suspend bad actors, and generate system reports.\n\nThe platform’s core innovation is the clear separation of responsibilities:\n- Buyers focus on discovery and purchase.\n- Sellers focus on product and fulfillment.\n- Admins focus on integrity and growth.\n\nThis structure lowers barriers for small sellers, builds customer trust through verified purchases, and enables scalable, sustainable marketplace operations.\n\n## Revenue Streams\n\nThe platform generates revenue through three primary streams:\n\n1. **Transaction Fees on Sales**\n   - THE ShoppingMall platform SHALL charge a service fee of 8% on every completed order.\n   - THE fee SHALL be calculated based on the total item value (excluding shipping and taxes) at the time of payment processing.\n   - THE fee SHALL be deducted automatically before payout to the seller.\n   - THE customer SHALL NOT see the fee amount displayed during checkout.\n   - THE seller SHALL see the fee amount itemized in their earnings report.\n\n2. **Seller Subscription Tier (Premium Store)**\n   - WHEN a seller upgrades to a Premium Store tier, THE ShoppingMall platform SHALL charge a monthly subscription of $29.99.\n   - THE Premium Store SHALL unlock the following benefits:\n     - Priority listing in category search results\n     - Custom storefront branding with logo and banner\n     - Enhanced analytics (customer demographics, repeat buyer rates)\n     - Ability to offer limited-time promotional codes\n     - Dedicated seller support channel\n   - WHEN a seller cancels the Premium Store subscription, THE platform SHALL retain all benefits until the end of the current billing cycle, then downgrade to free tier.\n   - THE seller SHALL receive email reminders 7 days before renewal.\n\n3. **Featured Product Placement**\n   - WHERE a seller requests to feature a specific product in the homepage carousel or category hero section, THE ShoppingMall platform SHALL charge a one-time placement fee of $199 per product.\n   - THE featured placement SHALL last for 14 days.\n   - THE system SHALL display a \"Featured\" badge next to the product in search and category listings.\n   - THE platform SHALL limit featured placements to 5 products per category at any time to ensure fairness.\n   - IF the featured product is removed from inventory or disabled, THE placement SHALL be automatically canceled and refunded proportionally based on remaining days.\n\n## Cost Structure\n\nThe primary operating costs of the ShoppingMall platform include:\n\n1. **Platform Maintenance & Infrastructure**\n   - THE platform SHALL incur costs for cloud hosting, database storage, content delivery, and backend server operations.\n   - THESE costs SHALL scale with transaction volume and user base growth.\n\n2. **Payment Processing Fees**\n   - WHEN a customer completes a payment, THE platform SHALL pay third-party payment gateways a fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.\n   - THESE fees SHALL be absorbed by the platform and not passed directly to sellers or customers.\n\n3. **Customer Support Operations**\n   - WHILE customers submit refund requests or report issues, THE platform SHALL allocate staff time to investigate, mediate, and resolve cases.\n   - THE support team SHALL handle cases involving order errors, seller disputes, and fraud reports.\n\n4. **Admin Tools & Security**\n   - THE platform SHALL invest in fraud detection tools, data encryption, audit logging, and compliance systems to protect all users.\n   - THESE investments SHALL be mandatory and scale with regulatory requirements.\n\n5. **Marketing & User Acquisition**\n   - WHEN acquiring new customers or sellers, THE platform SHALL spend on digital advertising, influencer partnerships, and referral programs.\n   - THESE costs SHALL be optimized based on customer acquisition cost (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV) metrics.\n\n## Customer Acquisition Strategy\n\nThe platform will attract users through a phased approach:\n\n1. **Seller Recruitment**\n   - WHEN new sellers sign up, THE platform SHALL provide a 30-day fee waiver on transaction fees for their first 10 sales.\n   - WHERE a seller refers another verified seller who completes 5 sales, THE referring seller SHALL receive a $50 platform credit.\n   - THE platform SHALL actively recruit niche sellers through industry-specific online communities and marketplaces.\n\n2. **Customer Acquisition**\n   - WHEN customers make their first purchase, THE platform SHALL offer a $10 discount (applied automatically at checkout).\n   - THE customer SHALL receive a welcome email series highlighting top-rated sellers and best-selling categories.\n   - WHEN a customer leaves a verified review, THE platform SHALL enter them into a monthly draw for a $100 shopping credit.\n\n3. **Retention Through Loyalty**\n   - WHILE a customer makes 3 or more purchases, THE platform SHALL unlock a \"Loyal Buyer\" badge on their profile.\n   - THE platform SHALL email customers with personalized product recommendations based on past purchases and wishlists.\n   - THE system SHALL notify customers when items in their wishlist drop in price.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nSuccess will be measured through the following business metrics:\n\n1. **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**\n   - THE platform SHALL track and report MAU as the number of unique customers who log in or place an order per month.\n   - TARGET: Increase MAU by 20% month-over-month for the first 6 months.\n\n2. **Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)**\n   - THE platform SHALL calculate GMV as the total value of all completed orders before any fees or refunds.\n   - TARGET: Achieve $1M in GMV within the first 12 months.\n\n3. **Seller Retention Rate**\n   - THE platform SHALL measure seller retention as the percentage of approved sellers who list at least one product and make at least one sale within 60 days of approval.\n   - TARGET: Achieve 80% seller retention at 90 days.\n\n4. **Transaction Fee Revenue**\n   - THE platform SHALL track the total monthly amount collected from the 8% transaction fee.\n   - TARGET: Achieve $50,000 in monthly transaction fee revenue by month 10.\n\n5. **Average Order Value (AOV)**\n   - THE platform SHALL calculate AOV as GMV divided by the number of orders.\n   - TARGET: Raise AOV from $45 to $65 within 8 months.\n\n6. **Refund Rate**\n   - THE platform SHALL monitor refund rate as the percentage of total orders that are fully or partially refunded.\n   - TARGET: Maintain refund rate below 5% of total orders.\n\n7. **Customer Review Rate**\n   - THE platform SHALL count the percentage of completed orders that receive a review within 45 days.\n   - TARGET: Achieve 35% of orders receiving verified reviews.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nThe ShoppingMall platform will be considered successful when all of the following criteria are met for three consecutive months:\n\n1. The platform generates at least $150,000 in total monthly revenue (from transaction fees, subscriptions, and product placements).\n2. The seller retention rate remains above 75%.\n3. The customer refund rate remains below 6%.\n4. The average order value exceeds $60.\n5. The monthly active user count exceeds 50,000.\n6. At least 20% of sellers are subscribed to the Premium Store tier.\n7. The platform receives fewer than 100 high-priority fraud or abuse reports per month.\n\nSuccess is not defined by technical performance or application speed — it is defined by the health of the marketplace ecosystem: growing seller participation, increasing customer trust, and sustainable revenue generation.\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

Each product SHALL be represented as a distinct entity with a unique identifier, a primary name, a detailed description, and associated media.\n\n## Category and Subcategory Hierarchy\n\nWHEN a customer navigates the product catalog, THE system SHALL display categories and subcategories in a nested, hierarchical tree structure with up to three levels: Primary Category > Subcategory > Sub-subcategory. Each category SHALL have a unique identifier, a display name, and an optional description.\n\nTHE system SHALL support the assignment of one or more categories to a single product to allow cross-category visibility (e.g., a product can belong to both \"Men's Shoes\" and \"Running Gear\").\n\nWHILE browsing a category, THE system SHALL display only products assigned to that category and its directly nested subcategories. Products shall not be displayed in sibling or parent categories unless explicitly assigned.\n\n## Search and Filtering Capabilities\n\nWHEN a customer enters a search query in the global search bar, THE system SHALL return matching products based on:\n- Product name (substring match)\n- Product description (keyword match)\n- Product brand (exact or partial match)\n\nTHE system SHALL return results in real-time as the user types for common queries, with a maximum latency of 1.5 seconds from query submission to result display.\n\nWHEN a customer selects a category, THE system SHALL provide dynamic filtering options based on the products within that category and its subcategories. Filters SHALL include:\n- Price range (slider with min/max values derived from visible products)\n- Brand (unique brand names from visible products)\n- Customer rating (rating thresholds: 4 stars and above, 3 stars and above)\n- Availability (In Stock / Out of Stock toggle)\n\nTHE system SHALL support multi-select filtering. When multiple filters are applied, THE system SHALL return products that meet ALL selected criteria simultaneously.\n\nIF a search returns zero results, THE system SHALL display a friendly message prompting the customer to adjust search terms or browse categories, and SHALL suggest popular or related categories.\n\n## Product Variant (SKU) Management\n\nWHEN a product has multiple variations (e.g., color, size, style), THE system SHALL represent each variation as a unique Stock Keeping Unit (SKU).\n\nTHE product SHALL have a master product entity that defines:\n- The core product name and description\n- The set of configurable attributes (e.g., \"Color\", \"Size\", \"Material\")\n- Common media (images, videos)\n\nEACH SKU SHALL have:\n- A unique, system-generated SKU code (e.g., \"SH-RED-M-2024\")\n- Values for each configurable attribute (e.g., \"Color: Red\", \"Size: M\")\n- A distinct, independent inventory level\n- A distinct price (which may differ from the base price)\n- Unique images if the difference is visual (such as color variants)\n\nTHE system SHALL display the product's master information and list all available SKUs as selectable options (e.g., color swatches, size buttons).\n\nTHE system SHALL prohibit selection of SKUs that have zero available inventory, unless the product has been marked as \"Backorderable\" by the seller.\n\n## Inventory and Availability Rules\n\nTHE inventory level SHALL be tracked per SKU, not per master product. EACH SKU SHALL maintain its own stock count.\n\nWHEN a product's SKU inventory level reaches zero, THE system SHALL:\n- Display the SKU as \"Out of Stock\" and disable selection\n- Prevent addition to cart or wishlist\n- Display a clear \"Out of Stock\" badge on the product page\n- Allow the SKU to remain visible for informational purposes (e.g., to show past availability)\n\nWHEN a seller adds new inventory to an out-of-stock SKU, THE system SHALL immediately update the availability status and re-enable the SKU for selection and purchase.\n\nWHERE a seller has set a minimum inventory threshold (e.g., \"Show when below 5 units\"), THE system SHALL display a \"Low Stock\" warning (e.g., \"Only 3 left!\") when inventory falls below that threshold.\n\n## Product Media Requirements\n\nTHE system SHALL require each product to have at least one primary image.\n\nEACH product SHALL support:\n- A minimum of one main product image\n- An optional gallery of up to 10 supplementary images\n- Up to 2 product videos (maximum 2 minutes each)\n\nTHE system SHALL display all images and videos within a scrollable carousel on the product detail page.\n\nWHERE a SKU has a unique visual appearance (e.g., color variation), THE system SHALL provide a dedicated image for that SKU to reflect its specific appearance.\n\nWHEN a customer selects a SKU variant, THE system SHALL update the displayed product image in real-time to match the selected variant's appearance.\n\nTHE system SHALL maintain responsive image rendering across device types (mobile, tablet, desktop) and SHALL use appropriate image formats (WebP preferred) for performance optimization.\n\n### Business Rule: SKU Attribute Consistency\n\nWHILE a product is published with defined attribute names (e.g., \"Color\", \"Size\"), THE system SHALL prevent sellers from changing the names of those attributes once a SKU has been created with that name. New variants may be added, but existing attribute names are locked to ensure data integrity.\n\n### Business Rule: Media Association\n\nWHEN a product's primary image is changed, THE system SHALL not change the media associated with existing SKUs unless explicitly requested by the seller. Each SKU retains its own images even if overridden by the master product.\n\n### Business Rule: Cross-Category Visibility\n\nTHE system SHALL maintain consistent product visibility based on category assignment, regardless of SKU selection. If a product is assigned to multiple categories, selecting a SKU does not restrict the product to a single category.\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Product Catalog and SKU Relationship\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Master Product\"] --> B[\"Product Name\"]\n  A --> C[\"Product Description\"]\n  A --> D[\"Primary Image\"]\n  A --> E[\"Available Attributes: Color, Size\"]\n  A --> F[\"Category Assignments\"]\n  B --> G[\"SKU 1\"]\n  C --> G\n  D --> G\n  E --> G\n  A --> G\n  G[\"SKU 1: Color=Red, Size=M\"] --> H[\"SKU ID: SH-RD-M-2024\"]\n  G --> I[\"Price: $59.99\"]\n  G --> J[\"Inventory: 12\"]\n  G --> K[\"Main Image: red-m.jpg\"]\n  B --> L[\"SKU 2\"]\n  C --> L\n  D --> L\n  E --> L\n  A --> L\n  L[\"SKU 2: Color=Blue, Size=M\"] --> M[\"SKU ID: SH-BL-M-2024\"]\n  L --> N[\"Price: $59.99\"]\n  L --> O[\"Inventory: 5\"]\n  L --> P[\"Main Image: blue-m.jpg\"]\n  F --> Q[\"Category: Men's Footwear\"]\n  F --> R[\"Category: Running Gear\"]\n  Q --> G\n  Q --> L\n  R --> G\n  R --> L\n```\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Product Search and Filtering Workflow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Customer Enters Search Query\"] --> B{\"Query Length > 3?\"}\n  B -->|Yes| C[\"Search Name, Description, Brand\"]\n  B -->|No| D[\"Show Recent Searches or Popular Products\"]\n  C --> E[\"Filter Results by Category, if selected\"]\n  E --> F[\"Apply Price Filter\"]\n  F --> G[\"Apply Brand Filter\"]\n  G --> H[\"Apply Rating Filter\"]\n  H --> I[\"Apply Availability Filter\"]\n  I --> J[\"Return & Display Ordered Results\"]\n  J --> K[\"Display \"Low Stock\" indicator if applicable\"]\n  J --> L[\"Display \"Out of Stock\" indicator for unavailable SKUs\"]\n```\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: SKU Inventory and Availability Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Customer Selects SKU Variant\"] --> B{\"Inventory > 0?\"}\n  B -->|Yes| C[\"Enable Add to Cart\" and \"Add to Wishlist\"]\n  B -->|No| D[\"Disable Add to Cart\" and \"Add to Wishlist\"]\n  D --> E[\"Display 'Out of Stock' badge\"]\n  C --> F[\"Customer Adds to Cart or Wishlist\"]\n  F --> G[\"System Checks Inventory Again Before Final Purchase\"]\n  G --> H{\"Inventory Still Available?\"}\n  H -->|Yes| I[\"Process Order\"]\n  H -->|No| J[\"Show Error: \\\"Item out of stock.

Please update your cart.\"\n- Provide a link back to the product page to allow selection of another variant\n- Log the event as an inventory conflict for seller analytics\n\n### Business Rule: Category-Specific Filters\n\nWHEN a customer navigates to the \"Electronics\" category, THE system SHALL display filters that are relevant to electronics products, such as: \"Brand\", \"Warranty Period\", \"Connectivity Type\".\n\nWHEN a customer navigates to the \"Clothing\" category, THE system SHALL display filters such as: \"Fabric Type\", \"Season\", \"Fit (Slim, Regular, Loose)\".\n\nTHE system SHALL auto-generate available filters based on the pattern of attribute values used by sellers in products within that category and its subcategories.\n\n### Business Rule: Real-Time Inventory Integrity\n\nWHILE multiple customers are browsing or adding items to cart, THE system SHALL maintain real-time inventory accuracy. Inventory levels MUST reflect actual counts as they are modified, even under concurrent access.\n\nIF a customer partially completes checkout and leaves the process (e.g., closes browser), THE system SHALL not decrease inventory until the order is confirmed and payment is authorized. Inventory is reserved only after successful payment processing."},{"reason":"To define how users interact with products through wishlists and shopping carts — key intermediate states before purchase.

Each step must validate dependencies from previous steps and enforce business rules before proceeding.\n\n### Shipping Address Selection\n\nWHEN a customer initiates checkout, THE system SHALL display all registered shipping addresses associated with their account.\n\nWHERE a customer has no registered addresses, THE system SHALL prompt them to add a new address before continuing.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow customers to select one address as primary for delivery.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow customers to create or edit an address during checkout without leaving the flow.\n\nWHEN an address is modified during checkout, THE system SHALL temporarily store the edited version for this order only (without saving to the user's address book).\n\nIF the selected shipping address is outside the seller's delivery region, THEN THE system SHALL disable the \"Proceed to Payment\" button and display: \"This seller does not ship to the selected location. Please choose another address or contact seller for special arrangements.\"\n\n### Payment Method Selection\n\nWHEN a customer reaches the payment step, THE system SHALL display all payment methods linked to their account.\n\nTHE system SHALL permit customers to add a new payment method (credit/debit card or digital wallet) during checkout.\n\nWHEN a customer adds a new payment method, THE system SHALL validate the payment details in real-time (format, card number checksum, expiry date) without processing an actual charge.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow customers to override account defaults and select any valid payment method for this order.\n\nWHERE a customer has no active payment methods, THE system SHALL require them to add at least one before proceeding.\n\n### Order Summary Review\n\nWHEN a customer selects a shipping address and payment method, THE system SHALL display a detailed order summary.\n\nTHE order summary SHALL include:\n- List of products with item name, selected SKU variant, and quantity\n- Price per unit and total for each item\n- Shipping cost based on address and seller policy\n- Estimated delivery date range (based on seller fulfillment time and shipping carrier)\n- Tax amount calculated by region\n- Order subtotal\n- Order total (subtotal + shipping + tax)\n\nTHE system SHALL highlight any products in the cart that have been updated since the cart was created:\n- Stock level changed (e.g., now out-of-stock)\n- Price changed\n- Product discontinued\n\nWHEN a product has changed, THE system SHALL display a warning: \"[Product Name] has changed. The item may be unavailable or priced differently.\"\n\nWHEN customer reviews the summary, THE system SHALL require explicit confirmation before allowing payment to proceed.\n\nTHE system SHALL display a single button labeled \"Place Order and Pay Now\" — no other payment buttons are allowed.\n\n### Payment Processing Flow\n\nWHEN the customer clicks \"Place Order and Pay Now\", THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Lock inventory for all items in the order for 15 minutes\n2. Reserve the payment amount in the selected payment method\n3. Generate a unique order ID with format \"ORD-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX\" where XXXXX is a 5-digit sequential identifier\n4. Create an order record in system with status \"PENDING_PAYMENT\"\n5. Prompt the external payment gateway with the total amount and payment method details\n6. Display a loading state with message: \"Processing payment...\"\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT declare the order complete until it receives an approved response from the payment gateway.\n\nIF multiple payment gateways are supported, THE system SHALL:\n- Attempt payment through the selected gateway first\n- If gateway connection fails or returns timeout, show: \"Payment provider is temporarily unavailable. Please try another method or contact support.\"\n- Do not automatically retry with alternative gateway unless requested by customer\n\nThe payment gateway shall not be named or specified — the system must support infrastructure-agnostic gateway integration.\n\n### Order Confirmation\n\nWHEN payment is successfully authorized by the gateway, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Change order status to \"PAID\"\n2. Release the inventory lock and decrement inventory per SKU\n3. Notify the selected seller(s) with new order notification\n4. Send order confirmation email to customer\n5. Clear the cooperative cart\n6. Redirect customer to \"Order Confirmation\" page\n\nTHE confirmation page SHALL display:\n- Order ID\n- Order date and time (in Asia/Seoul timezone)\n- Estimated delivery window\n- Shipping address\n- Payment method used (e.g., \"Visa ending in 4242\")\n- List of items with final prices and quantities\n- Total amount charged\n- Link to \"View Order Details\"\n\nTHE system SHALL persist the order in database immediately after confirmation.\n\n### Payment Failure Handling\n\nWHEN payment is declined by the gateway (insufficient funds, expired card, fraud block, etc.), THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Immediately release the inventory lock and return stock levels to prior state\n2. Set order status to \"PAYMENT_FAILED\"\n3. Display: \"Payment was not completed. Please review your payment details and try again.\"\n4. Keep the order record in system with error code and message from gateway\n5. Do not delete the cart — allow customer to return to cart and retry\n6. Allow customer to select a different payment method without restarting the entire checkout flow\n\nIF the customer returns to checkout after a failure, THE system SHALL pre-fill all previously selected shipping address and payment method with error indication:\n\n- Shipping address: normal display\n- Payment method: displayed with yellow warning icon and text: \"Payment was declined for this method. Try another.\"\n\nWHEN gateway returns timeout error after 10 seconds of no response, THE system SHALL:\n\n- Display: \"We couldn't confirm the payment status. Please check your bank statement. You may have been charged.\"\n- Set order status to \"UNKNOWN_PAYMENT_STATUS\"\n- Allow customer to:\n    - Retry payment (creates new transaction attempt)\n    - Cancel order (cancels request and releases inventory)\n    - Contact support\n\nTHE system SHALL monitor for late payment confirmations up to 2 hours after timeout. If a payment is later confirmed externally, THE system SHALL auto-update order to \"PAID\" and notify user via email.\n\n### Pending Payment State\n\nWHILE an order is in \"PENDING_PAYMENT\" state, THE system SHALL:\n\n- Keep inventory locked for 15 minutes\n- Prevent modification to cart, address, or method by customer\n- Display countdown timer: \"Your order will be canceled in 14:30 if payment is not completed.\"\n- Allow customer to cancel the order manually at any time (e.g., \"Cancel Order\" button)\n- If customer cancels, release inventory and set status to \"CANCELLED_BY_USER\"\n\nAFTER 15 minutes, IF no payment confirmation is received, THE system SHALL:\n\n1. Automatically release inventory lock\n2. Update order status to \"EXPIRED\"\n3. Send notification to customer: \"Your order expired due to uncompleted payment. Items may have been sold to someone else.\"\n4. Empty the cart\n\nTHE system SHALL log all payment state transitions, gateway responses, and inventory locks for audit and reconciliation purposes.\n\n### Order Success and Failure Scenarios\n\n#### Normal Success Path:\nCart → Address Selected → Payment Method Selected → Confirmation → Payment Authorized → PAID → Inventory Updated → Seller Notified → User Redirected\n\n#### Failure Path 1 (Card Declined):\nCart → Address Selected → Payment Method Selected → Confirmation → Payment Declined → PAYMENT_FAILED → Inventory Restored → User Notified → Can Retry\n\n#### Failure Path 2 (Time Out):\nCart → Address Selected → Payment Method Selected → Confirmation → Payment Timeout → UNKNOWN_PAYMENT_STATUS → User Options: Retry / Cancel / Contact Support → If 2h later payment confirmed → Auto-update to PAID\n\n#### Failure Path 3 (Inventory Changed):\nCart → Address Selected → Payment Method Selected → Confirmation → One Item Discontinued → Warning Shown → User Can Remove Item or Cancel → If Proceed —> Update Total → Payment → PAID → Adjusted Inventory Only\n\n#### Failure Path 4 (Fraud Flag):\nCart → Address Selected → Payment Method Selected → Confirmation → Payment Gateway Flags as High Risk → PAYMENT_FAILED → User Notified → Requires Customer Verification → Can Try Alternative Method\n\n### Business Rules Summary\n\n- **Inventory must be locked before payment initiation** — NOT before cart review\n- **An order is only confirmed after successful payment authorization** — not when \"Place Order\" is clicked\n- **Every payment failure must restore inventory** — no exceptions\n- **User must explicitly confirm final order and price before payment** — no auto-payment\n- **Payment handling must be gateway-agnostic** — no provider names hardcoded\n- **Shipping address validation is mandatory** — cannot proceed if seller does not ship there\n- **All status changes are permanent entries in order history** — no soft deletes\n- **Users may always cancel a PENDING_PAYMENT order** — even after 14 minutes remaining\n- **Payment retries must preserve original order context** — address, items, quantities, tax\n- **Customers must be notified if an item in their cart changes price or availability**\n- **Customer-facing messages must always be clear, non-technical, and action-oriented**\n- **The system must handle concurrent transactions** — if two users buy last item simultaneously, second user must be notified inventory is gone before payment tries to complete\n\n### Mermaid: Order Placement Workflow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Cart Validated] --> B[Select Shipping Address]\n    B --> C[Select Payment Method]\n    C --> D[Review Order Summary]\n    D --> E{Confirm Order}\n    E -->|Yes| F[Lock Inventory: 15min]\n    E -->|No| Z[Cancel Checkout]\n    F --> G[Initiate Payment]\n    G --> H{Payment Success?}\n    H -->|Yes| I[Update Order Status: PAID]\n    H -->|No| J[Update Order Status: PAYMENT_FAILED]\n    I --> K[Release Inventory Lock]\n    I --> L[Notify Seller]\n    I --> M[Send Confirmation Email]\n    I --> N[Redirect to Confirmation Page]\n    J --> O[Restore Inventory]\n    J --> P[Show Error & Retry Options]\n    J --> Q[Order Status: PAYMENT_FAILED]\n    H -->|Timeout| R[Update Status: UNKNOWN_PAYMENT_STATUS]\n    R --> S[Display: Check Bank Statement]\n    R --> T[Allow: Retry / Cancel / Contact Support]\n    F --> U{15 Minutes Passed?}\n    U -->|Yes| V[Auto-cancel: EXPIRED]\n    U -->|No| G\n    V --> W[Restore Inventory]\n    V --> X[Send Expired Notice]\n    V --> Y[Clear Cart]\n    Y --> Z\n```"},{"reason":"To define the workflow of order tracking, shipping updates, and post-purchase feedback — critical elements for customer trust and retention.","filename":"06-order-management.md","documentType":"user-flow","outline":["Order Status Lifecycle","Shipping Status Updates","Tracking Information Display","Customer Cancellation Requests","Refund Request and Approval Flow","Product Return Policy"],"audience":"development team","keyQuestions":["What are the defined order statuses?","How are shipping updates communicated?","Who can approve refunds — customer, seller, or admin?","Is partial refund allowed?"],"detailLevel":"detailed specification","constraints":["Must include at least five distinct order statuses","Must allow seller to update shipping information","Must allow admin to override cancellation/refund decisions","Must support partial refunds if item is partially returned"],"relatedDocuments":["05-checkout-flow.md","07-authentication-flow.md"],"content":"## Order Management Workflow\n\n### Order Status Lifecycle\n\nThe system SHALL maintain a clear, sequential order status lifecycle that tracks the journey of an order from initiation to completion. Every order SHALL begin in the 'Created' status and progress through predefined stages. The following statuses are mandatory and must be used in exactly this sequence:\n\n- \"Created\" — The order has been submitted and payment is pending. Cart items are reserved but inventory is not yet decremented. This state lasts until payment is confirmed.\n\n- \"Paid\" — Payment has been successfully processed and verified. At this stage, inventory for each SKU in the order SHALL be decremented immediately, and the order SHALL be assigned to the respective seller for fulfillment.\n\n- \"Awaiting Shipment\" — The seller has acknowledged the order and is preparing items for dispatch. Seller SHALL have the ability to manually update this status only after confirming the order details and packaging. Shipping label generation is permitted but not required at this stage.\n\n- \"Shipped\" — The seller has attached a tracking number and carrier information to the order. The system SHALL publish this tracking information to the customer's dashboard and send notification. Status shall be updated ONLY by the seller or admin.\n\n- \"Delivered\" — The system SHALL automatically transition to this status when the designated delivery service reports successful delivery. If the delivery service does not provide automated tracking updates, admin SHALL have the authority to manually set this status after verifying customer confirmation.\n\n- \"Completed\" — The order SHALL reach this final state 48 hours after the \"Delivered\" status, provided no return or refund request has been initiated. If a return or refund request is submitted in the interim, the order SHALL remain in \"Delivered\" and the refund process SHALL override the auto-transition.\n\n- \"Canceled\" — This status may be reached at any point before \"Shipped\" via customer-initiated cancellation (see below) or admin override. \"Canceled\" orders SHALL NOT reduce inventory. Customer SHALL be instantly refunded in full.\n\n- \"Refunded\" — A status that can only be reached after successful processing of a full or partial refund. SHALL not be set manually; SHALL be the result of refund approval.\n\nNo custom statuses shall be allowed. Only the system, seller, or admin SHALL be permitted to update order status — no customer-initiated status changes beyond cancellation.\n\n### Shipping Status Updates\n\nWHEN a seller updates the order status from \"Awaiting Shipment\" to \"Shipped\", THE system SHALL require the entry of:\n\n- Carrier name (free text, maximum 100 characters)\n- Tracking number (alphanumeric, required field)\n- Estimated delivery window (optional date range)\n- Actual shipping date (auto-populated as the timestamp of status change)\n\nWHEN a shipping update is saved, THE system SHALL:\n\n- Send an automatic notification to the customer via email and in-app push\n- Update the order tracking page to display the carrier, tracking number, and estimated delivery date\n- Log the update in the audit trail with the seller's user ID and timestamp\n\nWHERE an order has multiple shipments (e.g., split fulfillment from different warehouses), THE system SHALL support multiple tracking updates. Each shipment SHALL be displayed as a separate entry on the tracking page with:\n\n- Shipment number (e.g., “Shipment #1 of 2”)\n- Carrier and tracking number for that parcel\n- Expected delivery date for that parcel\n- Status (Shipped, In Transit, Delivered)\n\nWHILE an order is in “Shipped” status, THE system SHALL monitor automated tracking updates from supported carriers (via integration) and automatically update the customer-facing tracking status (In Transit, Out for Delivery, Delivered). If no automatic update arrives within 4 business days, THE system SHALL send an alert to the admin.\n\n### Tracking Information Display\n\nTHE customer dashboard SHALL display tracking information in a persistent, always-visible section entitled \"Order Tracking\". The display SHALL include:\n\n- Order ID and date\n- Current status with visual indicator (color-coded)\n- Carrier logo and name\n- Tracking number with clickable link to carrier’s tracking site\n- Estimated delivery date\n- A timeline of all status changes, displayed as a vertical list with timestamps\n- If multiple shipments exist, a collapsible accordion per shipment\n\nIF the tracking number is invalid or carrier is unsupported, THE system SHALL display: \"Tracking information is pending verification. Please contact seller for details.\" and SHALL prevent clickable links.\n\nWHEN the order status is \"Delivered\" or \"Completed\", THE tracking timeline SHALL remain visible for 90 days after delivery. After 90 days, the tracking section SHALL be closed and archived, with only the final status still visible.\n\n### Customer Cancellation Requests\n\nWHEN a customer requests cancellation of an order, THE system SHALL evaluate the request based on the current status:\n\n- IF the order status is \"Created\" or \"Paid\", THEN THE system SHALL allow cancellation and immediately initiate full refund.\n- IF the order status is \"Awaiting Shipment\", THEN THE system SHALL permit cancellation ONLY if requested within 24 hours of order creation. If request is made after 24 hours, THE system SHALL notify the customer: \"Cancellation requested. Your seller has 48 hours to approve. If unapproved, the order will proceed to shipment.\"\n- IF the order status is \"Shipped\" or later, THEN THE system SHALL deny automatic cancellation and instead redirect the customer to the Return Request flow.\n\nWHEN a cancellation is pending seller approval (in \"Awaiting Shipment\" after 24 hours), THE system SHALL:\n\n- Immediately notify the seller via email and admin panel\n- Place a 48-hour countdown timer visible to both seller and customer\n- If seller does not approve or deny within 48 hours, THE system SHALL automatically deny the cancellation and proceed to \"Shipped\" status\n\nWHEN a cancellation is approved, THE system SHALL:\n\n- Set status to \"Canceled\"\n- Release all reserved inventory back to the seller’s stock\n- Initiate full refund through the original payment method\n- Send confirmation notification to customer\n- Log the cancellation request, approval, and refund in audit trail\n\n### Refund Request and Approval Flow\n\nWHEN a customer requests a refund for an order, the system SHALL factor the order status:\n\n- IF the order status is \"Delivered\", THEN customer SHALL be allowed to request either full or partial refund (e.g., for damaged goods, missing items, wrong product).\n- IF the order status is \"Shipped\", THEN refund request SHALL NOT be permitted. Customer SHALL be advised to wait for delivery and then initiate return.\n- IF the order status is \"Created\", \"Paid\", or \"Awaiting Shipment\", cancellation SHALL be used instead of refund.\n\nWHEN a refund request is submitted, THE system SHALL require:\n\n- Reason for refund (from dropdown: \"Damaged items\", \"Incorrect item\", \"Item not as described\", \"Didn't receive\", \"Changed mind\")\n- Order of items to refund (checkboxes, each with SKU and quantity — defaults to whole order)\n- Upload option for photos (optional if reason is \"Damaged items\" or \"Incorrect item\")\n- Delivery confirmation code (if \"Didn’t receive\" is selected)\n\nIF the refund request is for less than the full order, THEN THE system SHALL:\n\n- Calculate refund amount based on item price and tax\n- Deduct original shipping cost if item shipped was part of free shipping promotion\n- Apply restocking fee if requested by seller (if configured by admin, max 15% per item)\n- Show preview of refund amount (item subtotal, shipping adjustments, fees) before submission\n\nWHEN the refund request is submitted, THE system SHALL:\n\n- Set order status to \"Refund Requested\"\n- Notify seller via dashboard alert\n- Place a 72-hour timer for seller response\n\nIF the seller approves the refund:\n\n- SET status to \"Refund Approved\"\n- Notify admin on refund amount\n- Initiate refund payment through original gateway\n- SET status to \"Refunded\"\n- Update inventory (if returning physical items, inventory remains decremented until returned)\n- Send confirmation to customer\n\nIF the seller denies the refund:\n\n- SET status to \"Refund Denied\"\n- Notify customer with reason given by seller\n- Allow customer to escalate request to admin\n\nIF the seller does not respond within 72 hours:\n\n- AUTO-APPROVE refund for full amount\n- SET status to \"Refunded\"\n- Send notification to customer\n- Notify admin of auto-approval\n\nWHEN an admin overrides a seller’s decision (to approve or deny):\n\n- Admin SHALL be able to override at any point after request submitted\n- Changes SHALL be logged with admin ID and reason\n- System SHALL auto-update status and trigger refund if approved\n\nTHEN THE system SHALL record all refund actions, communication, and final payment state in the order audit log with associated timestamps.\n\n### Product Return Policy\n\nTHE system SHALL allow customer returns only for items with status \"Delivered\" or \"Refunded\".\n\nWHEN a refund is approved and return is required, THE system SHALL:\n\n- Generate a prepaid return shipping label (based on carrier, region, and product weight — determined by seller’s configured return policy)\n- Email the label to the customer\n- Display the label in the order's \"Returns\" section\n- Provide a 14-day window from time of approval to return item\n\nIF the customer does not initiate return within 14 days:\n\n- THE system SHALL auto-cancel the return request\n- THE order SHALL revert to \"Completed\" status\n- NO inventory shall be restored\n- NO further refund shall be issued\n\nIF the customer sends the item back:\n\n- Seller SHALL receive notification with return tracking number\n- Seller SHALL have 10 business days to inspect the returned item\n- Seller SHALL mark return as either \"Received & Approved\" or \"Received & Rejected\"\n\nIF seller rejects return:\n\n- THE system SHALL notify customer with reason provided by seller\n- THE system SHALL reverse the refund if already paid\n- THE order SHALL be set to \"Refund Reversed\"\n- the returned item DOES NOT return to inventory\n\nIF seller approves return:\n\n- THE system SHALL restore inventory of returned SKUs to seller’s available stock\n- THE system SHALL confirm: \"Your return has been processed. The refund of [amount] has been fully credited.\"\n- THE order SHALL be set to \"Refunded & Returned\"\n\nWHERE the seller has configured a \"no returns\" policy on a specific SKU (admin must approve flag):\n\n- THE system SHALL block return request for that item\n- WHEN customer attempts to return, THE system SHALL display: \"This item is final sale and cannot be returned. Contact seller for assistance.\"\n\nThe return labeling system SHALL be responsible only for generation and display:\n\n- The responsibility of ensuring the package is sent, tracking number is entered, and item is received lies entirely with the customer\n- The system SHALL NOT verify physical receipt — only that the return label was generated and claimed\n\nAll return activities SHALL be logged in audit trail:\n\n- Return request timestamp\n- Return label generation timestamp\n- Return shipping scan (customer-provided or carrier-provided)\n- Seller inspection and decision\n- Inventory restoration or rejection event\n- Final refund reversal or confirmation\n\nAny return activity not logged shall be considered invalid.\n\n## Business Rule Summary\n\n- Admin ALWAYS has final authority over cancellations and refunds — overrides seller decisions\n- Seller CAN update shipping details and approve/deny refund requests but cannot change order status directly past \"Shipped\"\n- Customer may request cancellation only up to \"Awaiting Shipment\" with conditions\n- Customer may request refund only after \"Delivered\"\n- Refund requires three-party alignment: customer request → seller approval → system processing\n- Inventory is only restored upon physical return and seller acceptance\n- Every action is immutable and permanently logged in audit trail\n- No custom statuses or manual status skips allowed\n\nThe system SHALL prevent any status transitions that violate this lifecycle. Any attempt to manually set an invalid status shall be blocked and logged as a security violation."},{"reason":"To define the processes by which users and sellers interact after purchase — reviews, ratings, and seller responsiveness.

Administrators have full authority to manage users, products, orders, and system integrity. This document defines the operational workflows, permissions, and constraints for administrative functions.\n\n### User Management\n\nAdmins have unrestricted control over all user accounts regardless of role (customer, seller, or admin). The system SHALL support the following user management capabilities:\n\n- WHEN an admin selects a user account, THE system SHALL display full user profile data, including registration date, email, phone, shipping addresses, last login, and active sessions.\n- WHEN an admin initiates a suspension, THE system SHALL immediately revoke all active sessions and prevent further login attempts.\n- WHEN an admin initiates a permanent ban, THE system SHALL permanently disable the account, retain all associated data for audit purposes, and prevent future registration using the same email or phone number.\n- WHILE a user account is suspended, THE system SHALL NOT allow any actions requiring authentication (e.g., placing orders, leaving reviews, accessing cart or wishlist).\n- WHILE a user account is banned, THE system SHALL NOT allow any interaction with the platform, including viewing public product listings.\n- IF an admin attempts to ban or suspend their own account, THE system SHALL display an error message and prevent the action.\n- IF an admin attempts to delete a user account, THE system SHALL NOT permit deletion; instead, THE system SHALL only allow suspension or banning to preserve audit trails.\n- WHERE an admin selects multiple users, THE system SHALL enable bulk suspension or banning operations with confirmation step.\n- WHERE a user has an active order in progress, THE system SHALL display a warning before suspending or banning that user.\n- THE system SHALL maintain an immutable audit log of all admin actions performed on user accounts, including timestamp, admin ID, action type, and reason provided.\n\n### Seller Approval Panel\n\nSellers are provisioned accounts that require explicit administrative approval before they can list products or receive orders.\n\n- WHEN a new seller registers, THE system SHALL create an account in \"Pending Approval\" status.\n- WHEN an admin accesses the seller approval panel, THE system SHALL display a list of pending sellers with their business name, contact information, documents uploaded (e.g., ID, business license), and registration date.\n- WHEN an admin approves a seller, THE system SHALL change their status to \"Approved\", send a notification email, and grant access to seller dashboard features.\n- WHEN an admin rejects a seller, THE system SHALL change their status to \"Rejected\", send a notification with reason, and prevent reapplication for 30 days.\n- IF a seller submits multiple approval requests within 30 days of rejection, THE system SHALL block further attempts and notify the admin via email.\n- WHILE a seller is pending approval, THE system SHALL NOT allow them to list products, update inventory, or view sales analytics.\n- WHERE a seller's submitted documents appear fraudulent or inconsistent, THE system SHALL highlight flags for admin review (e.g., mismatched names, invalid document numbers, stock photo indicators).\n- THE system SHALL support one-click re-approval for sellers previously approved and deactivated.\n- THE system SHALL maintain a history of all seller approval actions, including approver, decision time, and rationale.\n\n### Product Moderation\n\nAdmins regulate product listings to ensure compliance with platform standards and legal requirements.\n\n- WHEN an admin opens the product moderation panel, THE system SHALL display all products with moderation status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Flagged).\n- WHEN an admin flags a product, THE system SHALL immediately remove it from public search and catalog results, notify the seller, and trigger a review queue.\n- WHEN an admin approves a flagged product, THE system SHALL restore its visibility to customers.\n- WHEN an admin rejects a product, THE system SHALL remove it from the catalog, notify the seller with specific violation reason (e.g., \"infringes copyright\", \"misleading description\", \"prohibited item\"), and log the action.\n- IF a product is flagged by multiple customers and confirmed as invalid, THE system SHALL automatically escalate to admin review.\n- IF a seller has three or more rejected products in a 30-day period, THE system SHALL trigger a seller audit flag for admin review.\n- WHERE a product contains regulated content (e.g., pharmaceuticals, weapons, adult material), THE system SHALL require explicit admin approval before publication.\n- WHERE a product listing violates local legal restrictions in the user's region, THE system SHALL hide it from users in that region and notify the seller.\n- THE system SHALL maintain a log of all moderation actions, including product ID, seller ID, admin ID, timestamp, action taken, and reason provided.\n- THE system SHALL allow admin to edit product titles, descriptions, categories, and images directly without requiring seller intervention, with all changes recorded in an audit trail.\n\n### Order Override and Investigation\n\nAdmins may override seller-initiated order decisions to protect platform integrity and customer experience.\n\n- WHEN an admin accesses an order under investigation, THE system SHALL display full order history, payment details, seller communication logs, shipping updates, and customer service interactions.\n- WHEN an admin overrides a seller's order fulfillment decision, THE system SHALL immediately notify the seller that fulfillment has been overridden and auto-assign fulfillment to a backup vendor if available, or initiate admin-managed fulfillment.\n- WHEN an admin cancels an order after payment processing, THE system SHALL refund the customer automatically and update the payment gateway.\n- WHEN an admin deactivates a seller's order processing privileges, THE system SHALL place all pending orders from that seller into \"Admin Hold\" status and notify the customer.\n- WHILE an order is under admin investigation, THE system SHALL prevent the seller from shipping or updating the order status.\n- WHILE an order is in \"Admin Hold\" status, THE system SHALL display a visual badge on the order in customer and seller dashboards.\n- IF an order volume from a single seller exceeds 80% of the overall daily order count, THE system SHALL trigger an automated alert for admin review.\n- IF an admin detects patterns of fraudulent order creation (e.g., high-value orders with common shipping addresses), THE system SHALL flag the associated accounts for investigation.\n- THE system SHALL log all override actions, including original seller decision, admin override, timestamp, reason, and whether refund was issued.\n\n### Refund Approval Authority\n\nAdmins have final authority over refund decisions when seller and customer disagreement persists.\n\n- WHEN a customer requests a refund, THE system SHALL notify the seller and wait for response within 48 hours.\n- IF the seller denies the refund within 48 hours, THE system SHALL escalate the request to admin review.\n- WHEN an admin reviews a refund request, THE system SHALL display order details, reason given by customer, seller’s justification, delivery confirmation, product condition report, and communication history.\n- WHEN an admin approves a refund, THE system SHALL initiate full or partial refund to the original payment method and notify both parties.\n- WHEN an admin denies a refund request, THE system SHALL notify the customer with reason and indicate if appeal is possible.\n- WHERE a product has been returned, THE system SHALL require physical return confirmation from the shipping carrier before processing refund, unless value is below $10.\n- WHERE a refund request originates from a banned or suspended account, THE system SHALL require dual admin approval before processing.\n- WHERE the seller is suspended or no longer active, THE system SHALL auto-process approved refund requests without seller confirmation.\n- THE system SHALL maintain a refund audit trail, including customer, seller, admin, amount, payment method, reason, and outcome.\n\n### System-Wide Analytics and Reporting\n\nAdmins must access comprehensive analytics to monitor platform health and compliance.\n\n- WHEN an admin opens the analytics dashboard, THE system SHALL display real-time metrics: total active users, daily transactions, revenue per day, pending seller approvals, flagged products, and active refunds.\n- WHILE an admin generates a report, THE system SHALL allow selection of date range, metric type, and user segment (customers, sellers, regions).\n- WHEN an admin exports a report, THE system SHALL generate PDF or CSV files with the following data:\n  - Daily and monthly revenue trend\n  - Top 10 products by sales volume\n  - Top 10 sellers by order count\n  - Customer retention rate\n  - Refund rate by product category\n  - Seller approval success rate\n  - Order fulfillment time distribution\n  - Active suspension and ban counts\n- WHERE an admin selects ‘financial’ report type, THE system SHALL include tax calculation summary and payment gateway fees.\n- WHERE an admin selects ‘compliance’ report type, THE system SHALL include list of all rejected products, suspended sellers, and banned users.\n- THE system SHALL generate monthly compliance reports automatically and send them to designated regulatory email addresses.\n- THE system SHALL enable export of raw data for external audit tools.\n\n### Suspension and Ban Procedures\n\nSuspension and banning are administrative actions to protect platform integrity. These procedures follow strict policy and audit controls.\n\n- WHEN an admin suspends a user, THE system SHALL immediately prevent access to private features (cart, wishlist, orders) but maintain public visibility of user reviews and ratings.\n- WHEN an admin bans a user permanently, THE system SHALL hide all user-generated content (reviews, ratings, messages) from public view, but retain data for legal compliance.\n- WHEN an admin suspends a seller, THE system SHALL immediately remove their products from search and catalog results, cancel pending orders, and freeze all payouts.\n- WHILE a seller is suspended, THE system SHALL notify customers who were scheduled to receive products from them that fulfillment is under review.\n- IF a user is suspended three times within 6 months, THE system SHALL automatically trigger permanent ban after the third incident.\n- IF a seller is suspended three times within 30 days for inventory fraud, payment abuse, or customer harassment, THE system SHALL automatically deem it a permanent ban.\n- IF admin action results in direct financial loss to a customer, THE system SHALL auto-initiate refund with first-level approval.\n- THE system SHALL require a mandatory reason selection from a predefined list for all suspension and ban actions (e.g., \"Fraudulent activity\", \"Violation of terms\", \"Customer complaints\", \"Legal violation\").\n- THE system SHALL store all suspension/ban events in an immutable log, including IP address, device fingerprint, time, admin ID, and reason.\n- WHERE a user claims wrongful suspension or ban, THE system SHALL allow submission of appeal request, which shall be routed to a second-level admin for review within 24 hours.\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

Neither\r\n * adding extensions with `client` component only cause other components to\r\n * recompute.\r\n */\r\ndeclare class MergedExtensionsList {\r\n    private head?;\r\n    private constructor();\r\n    static empty(): MergedExtensionsList;\r\n    static single(extension: ExtensionArgs): MergedExtensionsList;\r\n    isEmpty(): boolean;\r\n    append(extension: ExtensionArgs): MergedExtensionsList;\r\n    getAllComputedFields(dmmfModelName: string): ComputedFieldsMap | undefined;\r\n    getAllClientExtensions(): ClientArg | undefined;\r\n    getAllModelExtensions(dmmfModelName: string): ModelArg | undefined;\r\n    getAllQueryCallbacks(jsModelName: string, operation: string): any;\r\n    getAllBatchQueryCallbacks(): BatchQueryOptionsCb[];\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport declare type MergeExtArgs<TypeMap extends TypeMapDef, ExtArgs extends Record<any, any>, Args extends Record<any, any>> = ComputeDeep<ExtArgs & Args & AllModelsToStringIndex<TypeMap, Args, 'result'> & AllModelsToStringIndex<TypeMap, Args, 'model'>>;\r\n\r\nexport declare type Metric<T> = {\r\n    key: string;\r\n    value: T;\r\n    labels: Record<string, string>;\r\n    description: string;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare type MetricHistogram = {\r\n    buckets: MetricHistogramBucket[];\r\n    sum: number;\r\n    count: number;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare type MetricHistogramBucket = [maxValue: number, count: number];\r\n\r\nexport declare type Metrics = {\r\n    counters: Metric<number>[];\r\n    gauges: Metric<number>[];\r\n    histograms: Metric<MetricHistogram>[];\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare class MetricsClient {\r\n    private _client;\r\n    constructor(client: Client);\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns all metrics gathered up to this point in prometheus format.\r\n     * Result of this call can be exposed directly to prometheus scraping endpoint\r\n     *\r\n     * @param options\r\n     * @returns\r\n     */\r\n    prometheus(options?: MetricsOptions): Promise<string>;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns all metrics gathered up to this point in prometheus format.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param options\r\n     * @returns\r\n     */\r\n    json(options?: MetricsOptions): Promise<Metrics>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare type MetricsOptions = {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Labels to add to every metrics in key-value format\r\n     */\r\n    globalLabels?: Record<string, string>;\r\n};\r\n\r\ndeclare type MetricsOptionsCommon = {\r\n    globalLabels?: Record<string, string>;\r\n};\r\n\r\ndeclare type MetricsOptionsJson = {\r\n    format: 'json';\r\n} & MetricsOptionsCommon;\r\n\r\ndeclare type MetricsOptionsPrometheus = {\r\n    format: 'prometheus';\r\n} & MetricsOptionsCommon;\r\n\r\ndeclare type MiddlewareArgsMapper<RequestArgs, MiddlewareArgs> = {\r\n    requestArgsToMiddlewareArgs(requestArgs: RequestArgs): MiddlewareArgs;\r\n    middlewareArgsToRequestArgs(middlewareArgs: MiddlewareArgs): RequestArgs;\r\n};\r\n\r\ndeclare type Model = ReadonlyDeep_2<{\r\n    name: string;\r\n    dbName: string | null;\r\n    schema: string | null;\r\n    fields: Field[];\r\n    uniqueFields: string[][];\r\n    uniqueIndexes: uniqueIndex[];\r\n    documentation?: string;\r\n    primaryKey: PrimaryKey | null;\r\n    isGenerated?: boolean;\r\n}>;\r\n\r\ndeclare enum ModelAction {\r\n    findUnique = \"findUnique\",\r\n    findUniqueOrThrow = \"findUniqueOrThrow\",\r\n    findFirst = \"findFirst\",\r\n    findFirstOrThrow = \"findFirstOrThrow\",\r\n    findMany = \"findMany\",\r\n    create = \"create\",\r\n    createMany = \"createMany\",\r\n    createManyAndReturn = \"createManyAndReturn\",\r\n    update = \"update\",\r\n    updateMany = \"updateMany\",\r\n    updateManyAndReturn = \"updateManyAndReturn\",\r\n    upsert = \"upsert\",\r\n    delete = \"delete\",\r\n    deleteMany = \"deleteMany\",\r\n    groupBy = \"groupBy\",\r\n    count = \"count\",// TODO: count does not actually exist in DMMF\r\n    aggregate = \"aggregate\",\r\n    findRaw = \"findRaw\",\r\n    aggregateRaw = \"aggregateRaw\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport declare type ModelArg = {\r\n    [MethodName in string]: unknown;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare type ModelArgs = {\r\n    model: {\r\n        [ModelName in string]: ModelArg;\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare type ModelKey<TypeMap extends TypeMapDef, M extends PropertyKey> = M extends keyof TypeMap['model'] ?

Categories form the taxonomy that enables navigation and\nfiltering in the frontend. This table enables parent-child relationships\nfor multi-level category trees, such as 'Electronics > Computers >\nLaptops'. Each category has its own display name, URL slug, and active\nstatus. This model is referenced by shopping_mall_product_categories but\nis never directly manipulated by end-users.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `parent_id`: Parent category in hierarchical tree. [shopping_mall_categories.id](#shopping_mall_categories).\n- `name`\n  > Display name of the category as shown to customers. Example:\n  > 'Electronics'.\n- `slug`\n  > URL-friendly identifier for the category. Used in routing and SEO. Must\n  > be unique. Example: 'electronics'.\n- `depth`\n  > Nesting level of the category in the hierarchy. Root categories have\n  > depth 0, children have depth 1+.\n- `is_active`\n  > Indicates whether the category is active and visible to customers.\n  > Inactive categories are hidden but preserved for historical reference.\n- `created_at`: Timestamp when the category was created.\n- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the category was last updated.\n- `deleted_at`: Timestamp when the category was soft-deleted. Null if active.\n\n### `shopping_mall_sections`\n\nDefines UI sections used across the platform for layout configuration.\nSections represent content areas on pages such as 'hero-banner',\n'featured-products', 'recommendations'. Each section has a unique\nidentifier for programmatic reference, a display name, priority for\nordering, and position for placement. Admins configure these sections to\ncontrol page layouts, but customers never interact with them directly.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `name`\n  > Display name of the section for admin interface. Example: 'Hero Banner\n  > Section'.\n- `identifier`\n  > Unique system identifier used in code and templates to reference this\n  > section. Must be unique.

Examples: 'top',\n  > 'sidebar', 'footer', 'middle'.\n- `is_active`\n  > Controls whether the section is active and rendered on pages. Inactive\n  > sections are hidden from display.\n- `created_at`: Timestamp when the section was created.\n- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the section was last updated.\n- `deleted_at`: Timestamp when the section was soft-deleted. Null if active.\n\n### `shopping_mall_system_configs`\n\nStores global system configuration parameters that control platform\nbehavior. Configuration values are stored as JSON strings to support\ncomplex structures while maintaining a simple key-value schema. This\ntable enables dynamic configuration changes without code deployment.\nValues are consumed by application services and admin tools. Key examples\ninclude 'payment_gateway_settings', 'refund_policy_defaults',\n'review_auto_moderation_rules'. This table is managed exclusively by\nsystem administrators via backend interfaces.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `key`\n  > Unique system-wide key identifying the configuration parameter. Must be\n  > unique. Example: 'payment_gateway_fee_percent'.\n- `value`\n  > JSON-encoded value of the configuration parameter. Supports strings,\n  > numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. Must be valid JSON.\n- `type`\n  > Type classification of the configuration value. Used for validation and\n  > UI rendering. Allowed values: 'string', 'int', 'boolean', 'json'.\n- `description`\n  > Human-readable description explaining the purpose and expected format of\n  > this configuration parameter.\n- `is_active`\n  > Indicates if the configuration is currently active. Inactive\n  > configurations are ignored by system processes.\n- `created_at`: Timestamp when the configuration was created.\n- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the configuration was last updated.\n- `deleted_at`: Timestamp when the configuration was soft-deleted.
