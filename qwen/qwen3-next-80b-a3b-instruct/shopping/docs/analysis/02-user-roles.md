## Role Hierarchy and Access Boundaries

The system enforces strict role boundaries to protect data integrity and business logic.

### Access Hierarchy

- **Customer** (member)
  - Can view catalog, cart, wishlist, own orders, submit reviews
  - Cannot list products, edit inventory, manage other users

- **Seller** (member)
  - Can do everything a customer can do
  - Can list products, manage SKUs and inventory, fulfill orders, respond to reviews
  - Cannot approve other sellers, view other sellers' data, override orders

- **Admin** (admin)
  - Can do everything a customer and seller can do
  - Can approve/reject sellers, override any order, view all user data, audit all actions
  - Cannot modify system architecture or programming logic

### Role Transition Rules

- WHEN a customer submits a seller application, THEN THE system SHALL retain their customer permissions until the application is approved.
- WHEN a seller application is rejected, THEN THE system SHALL downgrade their role to "customer" and revoke all seller access.
- WHEN a seller account is suspended or banned by admin, THEN THE system SHALL automatically downgrade their role to "customer" and disable all seller functionality.
- WHEN an admin removes a user from a group or deactivates an account, THEN THE system SHALL preserve data but deny any further access.
- THE system SHALL allow admin to manually elevate a customer to seller status without application, for special cases.

## Authentication and Session Requirements

User roles control access to system features, and authentication must enforce role-based permissions.

### Core Authentication Functions

- THE system SHALL allow users to register with email and password.
- THE system SHALL allow users to login using email and password.
- THE system SHALL allow users to logout and terminate their active session.
- THE system SHALL send an email verification link upon registration.
- THE system SHALL require email verification before permitting order placement or review submission.
- THE system SHALL allow password reset via verified email.
- THE system SHALL allow users to change their password at any time.
- THE system SHALL allow users to revoke sessions from all other devices.

### Session and Token Management

- THE system SHALL use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session authentication.
- THE access token SHALL expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- THE refresh token SHALL be valid for 30 days and stored in an httpOnly cookie.
- THE JWT payload SHALL include: userId (string), role (string), and permissions (array of strings).
- THE system SHALL include permissions array to ensure fine-grained authorization (e.g., ["view_products", "add_to_cart", "submit_review", "edit_seller_products"]).
- THE system SHALL validate token signature on every protected request.
- WHEN a token expires, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code "AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED".
- WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL invalidate the refresh token immediately.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- For each endpoint, THE system SHALL validate the userâ€™s role against required permissions.
- WHERE a request is made to a seller-only endpoint, THE system SHALL validate that role equals "seller" and seller account is approved.
- WHERE a request is made to an admin-only endpoint, THE system SHALL validate that role equals "admin".
- IF a userâ€™s role is modified by admin while they are active, THEN THE system SHALL require re-authentication to refresh JWT.
- THE system SHALL not permit role escalation through token tampering or frontend manipulation.
