/**
 * Create a new economic/political discussion post.
 *
 * This operation allows authenticated members to submit a new economic or
 * political discussion post. The post is created in 'pending' status and
 * remains invisible to all users until approved by an administrator, following
 * the platform's content moderation workflow.
 *
 * When a member submits a new post, the system requires a specific topic from
 * the seven predefined categories: 'Inflation', 'Tax Policy', 'Elections',
 * 'Global Trade', 'Monetary Policy', 'Labor Markets', or 'Fiscal Policy'. The
 * post must include a subject between 5 and 120 characters and content between
 * 10 and 5,000 characters. The system automatically assigns the current UTC
 * timestamp as the creation date and sets the status to 'pending' regardless of
 * the user's authentication level.
 *
 * The request body includes the topic identifier and content, with
 * authentication handled through a JWT token that identifies the member
 * creating the post. The system notes the member's ID in the database and
 * ensures all posts are properly attributed for moderation purposes. After
 * submission, the system renders a success message to the member indicating
 * that moderation is required before public visibility.
 *
 * Posts that fail validation (empty content, wrong topic format, exceeding
 * character limits) are rejected immediately with appropriate error messages.
 * The post history is preserved in the database with timestamps, and all
 * modifications are logged through the admin_id and moderation_reason fields
 * for audit purposes. This ensures accountability and compliance with the
 * platform's civil discourse principles.

/**
 * Update an existing economic board post.
 *
 * This operation allows authorized users to modify the content or subject of an
 * existing economic board post.
 *
 * The post must be in either 'published' or 'rejected' status to be eligible
 * for modification. Posts with 'deleted' status cannot be updated, and attempts
 * to update them will result in a 404 Not Found response, as the record is
 * permanently removed from active system state.
 *
 * For members, updates are only permitted within 24 hours of the post's
 * original creation timestamp. If the 24-hour window has expired, the update
 * request will be denied with a 403 Forbidden response, regardless of the
 * content changes being requested. This restriction enforces the system's
 * business rule of limiting post editing to a brief period after submission.
 *
 * Administrators have broader permissions and can update any post's content,
 * subject, or moderation status at any time. When an admin updates a post's
 * status (e.g., from 'rejected' to 'published'), the system records the admin
 * ID and any moderation_reason provided in the request. The moderation_reason
 * field can be used to document the rationale for status changes.
 *
 * The system automatically sets the updated_at timestamp to the current UTC
 * time and sets the edited flag to true when content or subject fields are
 * modified. If the original poster's user ID is provided in the JWT token, the
 * system performs ownership verification against the author_hash or member
 * association before allowing the update.
 *
 * This operation is critical for maintaining content integrity while respecting
 * both user edit windows and administrative authority. It supports the
 * platform's core principle of structured, time-limited editing balanced with
 * authoritative moderation.

/**
 * Permanently delete an economic board post.
 *
 * This operation permanently removes an economic board post from the system
 * with no possibility of recovery.
 *
 * The system performs a hard delete, as the economic_board_posts table does not
 * contain any soft delete fields (such as deleted_at or is_deleted). This
 * aligns with the requirements specified in the business rules, which state
 * that when an admin deletes a post, the content is removed permanently and
 * cannot be restored under any circumstances.
 *
 * The deletion is only permitted when performed by an admin user. Members and
 * guests cannot trigger deletion of any posts, even those they created.
 * Successful deletion requires a valid admin JWT token containing the 'admin'
 * role.
 *
 * Upon successful deletion, the system:
 *
 * 1. Completely removes all data from the economic_board_posts record
 * 2. Removes all associated replies from the economic_board_replies table using
 *    cascading delete
 * 3. Records the deletion event internally using the admin_id field (the ID of the
 *    admin who performed the deletion)
 * 4. Stores any provided moderation_reason to document why the post was deleted
 * 5. Sets the updated_at field to the deletion timestamp
 * 6. Changes the status field from its current value to 'deleted'
 *
 * The deleted record is no longer accessible through any public endpoint,
 * including search and topic filtering. Any attempts to retrieve the post by ID
 * will return a 404 Not Found response.
 *
 * For audit purposes, the system retains the deleted record's metadata in its
 * logical form (including admin_id and moderation_reason), but this data is not
 * exposed through any API endpoint and is treated as an internal operational
 * log.
 *
 * This implementation strictly adheres to the business rule that admin
 * deletions are final and irreversible. The absence of soft delete columns in
 * the schema dictates this hard delete behavior, ensuring data integrity and
 * simplifying the system's data retention model while still maintaining
 * sufficient audit trails for moderation transparency.
