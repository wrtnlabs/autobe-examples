/**
 * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated list of posts.
 *
 * This API endpoint enables users to search and retrieve a paginated list of
 * economic and political forum posts using advanced filtering criteria. Unlike
 * a simple GET request, this PATCH endpoint accepts a detailed request body
 * that specifies search parameters, topic filters, sorting preferences, and
 * pagination limits.
 *
 * The operation queries the economic_board_posts table which contains posts
 * with status indicators ('pending', 'published', 'rejected', 'deleted'),
 * associated topic IDs from economic_board_topics, timestamps for creation and
 * editing, content summaries, and processing metadata. This design supports
 * efficient filtering of content based on moderation status, publication date,
 * topic affiliation, and user context.
 *
 * For performance optimization, results are returned paginated using a standard
 * IPageIEconomicBoardPost response structure with a data array and pagination
 * metadata. The sorting defaults to chronological order (newest first) as per
 * user experience requirements, but supports custom sorting parameters. Topic
 * filtering enables users to view posts related to specific economic topics
 * like Inflation, Tax Policy, or Elections as defined by the system.
 *
 * Security considerations include limiting exposure to sensitive information -
 * user flags and moderator identifiers are normalized in the response. This
 * operation is designed to handle high-volume queries from client applications
 * without database strain. It complements other operations like at (for single
 * posts) and create (for posting new content), forming a complete content
 * discovery system.
 *
 * The request body must include a properly structured
 * IEconomicBoardPost.IRequest object with valid filter parameters. Any invalid
 * or malformed request parameters will result in a 400 Bad Request response
 * with clear error messages indicating validation failures.

/**
 * Retrieve a specific economic/political discussion post by ID.
 *
 * This operation retrieves a single economic or political discussion post
 * identified by its unique UUID. The system validates the requested post ID and
 * then checks its moderation status against the system's privacy and moderation
 * rules.
 *
 * Posts with status 'published' are returned with complete content including
 * the subject, full text, creation and update timestamps, topic reference,
 * editing status, moderation reason (if applicable), and reply count. If the
 * post has a non-'published' status (pending, rejected, or deleted), the system
 * returns a 404 Not Found response to maintain the integrity of the moderation
 * workflow and prevent exposure of unapproved content.
 *
 * The post data structure mirrors exactly the fields defined in the
 * economic_board_posts Prisma schema: id, economic_board_topics_id, created_at,
 * updated_at, status, subject, content, reply_count, edited, edited_at,
 * author_hash, admin_id, and moderation_reason. The topic field is referenced
 * via the topic relationship to economic_board_topics table, ensuring that
 * topic names are correctly resolved from the predefined fixed list.
 *
 * Post authors are displayed anonymously as requested by the platform's design
 * â€” no member names or guest identifiers are exposed in this response. The
 * system honors the business rule that all authors appear as 'Anonymous' to
 * users, with personal identifiers (including author_hash) only accessible to
 * administrators for moderation purposes and never exposed to public views.
 *
 * This operation supports public access to approved content while strictly
 * enforcing privacy rules around moderated content, aligning with the
 * platform's mission of civil discourse without public exposure of unverified
 * contributions.
