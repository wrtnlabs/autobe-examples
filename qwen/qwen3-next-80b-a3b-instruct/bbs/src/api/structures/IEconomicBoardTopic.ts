/**
 * System-defined topic categories for the economic/political discussion board.
 *
 * This model represents the fixed, immutable topic categories that govern
 * content organization and filtering across the platform. All posts must
 * reference exactly one of these predefined topics.
 *
 * The topic system is designed to be limited and controlled to maintain focus
 * and prevent fragmentation of the discussion space. There are exactly seven
 * predefined values that constitute the complete topic universe: "Inflation",
 * "Tax Policy", "Elections", "Global Trade", "Monetary Policy", "Labor
 * Markets", "Fiscal Policy".
 *
 * These topics serve as the foundational taxonomy for organizing economic and
 * political discourse. The system enforces strict adherence to these predefined
 * values to ensure consistency and avoid the creation of uncontrolled or
 * chaotic subtopics.
 *
 * Topic descriptors provide additional context for users to understand the
 * appropriate scope of each category, but the core topic names themselves are
 * strictly parameterized and immutable once created. This ensures long-term
 * stability in categorization and prevents drift or depletion of topic
 * integrity over time.
 *
 * All relationship references to this entity (such as from
 * economic_board_posts) are maintained through the id field, and this entity is
 * referenced in all post creation flows. This ensures every discussion on the
 * board is properly categorized and searchable within the defined thematic
 * boundaries.
