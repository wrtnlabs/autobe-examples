   * Retrieve a specific reply to a post by unique identifier.
   *
   * This operation retrieves a specific reply to an economic/political
   * discussion post. The reply must be identified by both the parent post's
   * unique identifier and the reply's unique identifier. This ensures the reply
   * is properly contextualized within the discussion thread hierarchy.
   *
   * The operation returns complete details about the reply including its
   * content, creation timestamp, and update timestamp. The reply content is
   * constrained to 5-1,000 characters as per business rules and includes no
   * moderation status since replies are automatically published without
   * requiring admin approval.
   *
   * Security considerations ensure that only authenticated users or guests can
   * access published replies, and that replies cannot be accessed if their
   * parent post has been deleted or rejected. The reply's guest identifier is
   * not exposed in the response for privacy purposes, as anonymous posting is
   * permitted on the platform.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the economic_board_replies table as defined
   * in the Prisma schema, incorporating all available reply fields. The
   * response includes only the essential information needed for display in a
   * discussion thread, with timestamps in ISO 8601 format for consistency with
   * system requirements.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier of the parent post to which the reply
   *   belongs
   * @param replyId Unique identifier of the specific reply to retrieve
