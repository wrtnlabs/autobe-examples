  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated list of posts.
   *
   * This API endpoint enables users to search and retrieve a paginated list of
   * economic and political forum posts using advanced filtering criteria.
   * Unlike a simple GET request, this PATCH endpoint accepts a detailed request
   * body that specifies search parameters, topic filters, sorting preferences,
   * and pagination limits.
   *
   * The operation queries the economic_board_posts table which contains posts
   * with status indicators ('pending', 'published', 'rejected', 'deleted'),
   * associated topic IDs from economic_board_topics, timestamps for creation
   * and editing, content summaries, and processing metadata. This design
   * supports efficient filtering of content based on moderation status,
   * publication date, topic affiliation, and user context.
   *
   * For performance optimization, results are returned paginated using a
   * standard IPageIEconomicBoardPost response structure with a data array and
   * pagination metadata. The sorting defaults to chronological order (newest
   * first) as per user experience requirements, but supports custom sorting
   * parameters. Topic filtering enables users to view posts related to specific
   * economic topics like Inflation, Tax Policy, or Elections as defined by the
   * system.
   *
   * Security considerations include limiting exposure to sensitive information
   * - user flags and moderator identifiers are normalized in the response. This
   * operation is designed to handle high-volume queries from client
   * applications without database strain. It complements other operations like
   * at (for single posts) and create (for posting new content), forming a
   * complete content discovery system.
   *
   * The request body must include a properly structured
   * IEconomicBoardPost.IRequest object with valid filter parameters. Any
   * invalid or malformed request parameters will result in a 400 Bad Request
   * response with clear error messages indicating validation failures.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search and filter parameters for economic board posts including
   *   pagination, topic filtering, and sorting options

  /**
   * Retrieve a specific economic/political discussion post by ID.
   *
   * This operation retrieves a single economic or political discussion post
   * identified by its unique UUID. The system validates the requested post ID
   * and then checks its moderation status against the system's privacy and
   * moderation rules.
   *
   * Posts with status 'published' are returned with complete content including
   * the subject, full text, creation and update timestamps, topic reference,
   * editing status, moderation reason (if applicable), and reply count. If the
   * post has a non-'published' status (pending, rejected, or deleted), the
   * system returns a 404 Not Found response to maintain the integrity of the
   * moderation workflow and prevent exposure of unapproved content.
   *
   * The post data structure mirrors exactly the fields defined in the
   * economic_board_posts Prisma schema: id, economic_board_topics_id,
   * created_at, updated_at, status, subject, content, reply_count, edited,
   * edited_at, author_hash, admin_id, and moderation_reason. The topic field is
   * referenced via the topic relationship to economic_board_topics table,
   * ensuring that topic names are correctly resolved from the predefined fixed
   * list.
   *
   * Post authors are displayed anonymously as requested by the platform's
   * design â€” no member names or guest identifiers are exposed in this response.
   * The system honors the business rule that all authors appear as 'Anonymous'
   * to users, with personal identifiers (including author_hash) only accessible
   * to administrators for moderation purposes and never exposed to public
   * views.
   *
   * This operation supports public access to approved content while strictly
   * enforcing privacy rules around moderated content, aligning with the
   * platform's mission of civil discourse without public exposure of unverified
   * contributions.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier of the discussion post to be retrieved
