   * Create a new economic topic category.
   *
   * This operation creates a new topic category for organizing economic and
   * political discussions on the platform. All topics must be registered in the
   * economic_board_topics table, which maintains a controlled vocabulary of
   * exactly seven predefined categories: "Inflation", "Tax Policy",
   * "Elections", "Global Trade", "Monetary Policy", "Labor Markets", "Fiscal
   * Policy".
   *
   * The system requires that topic names be exact, case-sensitive matches to
   * these predefined values. When a new topic is created, the system
   * automatically assigns the current UTC timestamp to created_at and
   * updated_at fields, and sets is_active to true by default. A description can
   * optionally be provided to clarify the scope of the topic.
   *
   * Administrative privileges are required to execute this operation, as it
   * affects the core content organization structure of the system. Creating
   * custom topics outside the predefined set is prohibited by system policy, so
   * this endpoint validates against the allowed values before persistence.
   *
   * Since topic names are immutable once created, this endpoint does not
   * support renaming or updating existing topics. To modify a topic's
   * description or activation status, a separate endpoint would be required.
   * The system does not allow soft deletion of topics; instead, topics are
   * deactivated through the is_active field to preserve historical post
   * integrity.

  /**

   * Retrieve a paginated list of economic board topics with detailed

   * operation queries the economic_board_topics table from the Prisma schema
   * and supports filtering by the is_active status field to show either active
   * or inactive topics.
   *
   * The operation implements pagination with configurable page size and offset
   * parameters to handle potentially large collections of topic categories.
   * Results are organized by creation date descending to prioritize newer
   * topics, but can be sorted by name or other metadata fields.
   *
   * For system administrators, this operation provides critical visibility into
   * topic availability, allowing them to identify inactive topics that may be
   * candidates for deprecation. The description field provides additional
   * context about each topic's scope and purpose.
   *
   * Security considerations include restricting topic modification to admin
   * users while allowing read access to all authenticated users. Rate limiting
   * is applied to prevent brute-force enumeration of topic categories. The
   * response includes only non-sensitive metadata, avoiding exposure of
   * internal identifiers or system configuration details.
   *
   * This operation integrates directly with the economic_board_topics entity as
   * defined in the Prisma schema, incorporating all available fields including
   * id, name, created_at, updated_at, is_active, and description. The
   * implementation ensures compatibility with the system's predefined topic

   * The operation validates that the topicId parameter corresponds to an

   *
   * Security is maintained by ensuring no sensitive information is exposed in

   * the scope and purpose of each category, helping users understand

   * The operation integrates directly with the economic_board_topics entity as
