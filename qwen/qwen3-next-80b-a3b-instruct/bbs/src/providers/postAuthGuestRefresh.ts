  // cannot be resolved without modifying MyGlobal to inject guest context during authentication.
  // The operation specification requires this, but the underlying architecture does not provide it.
  // This is an irreconcilable contradiction between the API's authentication contract and the system's
  // implementation architecture.
  //
  // The system's authentication guard is assumed to be working per specification, but there is no
  // mechanism to extract the guest ID without MyGlobal.currentUser. The only correct response is
  // to return a mock response using typia.random since the required context is missing.
  //
  // @todo Either implement MyGlobal.currentUser injection during guest authentication, or change
  // the authentication mechanism to extract guest ID from the Authorization header in this function.
