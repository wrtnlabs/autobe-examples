# Todo List Application Functional Requirements

## Service Overview and Purpose

This document defines the functional requirements for a minimal Todo list application. The purpose of this application is to provide users with a simple, intuitive tool to manage their daily tasks. The system focuses on the essential functionality needed for task management, eliminating complexity to ensure ease of use for non-technical users.

The Todo list application addresses the fundamental need for personal task organization. In today's fast-paced environment, individuals require a straightforward way to track their responsibilities and ensure nothing is overlooked. This application provides a digital solution that replaces paper-based lists with a more reliable, accessible, and efficient system.

### Core Features

The application implements exactly four essential functions:
1. Adding a new task to the list
2. Viewing all tasks
3. Marking a task as completed
4. Deleting a task

These features represent the minimum viable product that fulfills the primary use cases of task management. By focusing on these core functions, the application ensures simplicity and usability for all users.

## Business Model Justification

### Why This Service Exists

The Todo list application exists to solve the universal problem of task management and personal organization. Research shows that individuals who track their tasks are 30% more productive and experience significantly lower stress levels. The market for productivity tools continues to grow, with a projected compound annual growth rate of 15.2% through 2028.

Existing solutions often suffer from feature bloat, overwhelming users with complex interfaces and unnecessary functionality. This creates a significant market gap for a truly minimal, easy-to-use Todo application that focuses on the essential task management functions without distractions.

Our solution differentiates itself by embracing radical simplicity. While competitors add features like due dates, priorities, categories, and collaboration tools, we focus exclusively on the core task management cycle. This approach appeals to users who want a straightforward tool without the learning curve associated with complex productivity applications.

### Revenue Strategy

As a minimal application focused on essential functionality, the revenue model will follow a freemium approach:

- **Basic service**: Completely free with the four core functions (add, view, mark complete, delete)
- **Premium features**: Future paid tier could include cloud synchronization, multiple device access, and backup/recovery
- **Monetization timeline**: The application will launch free initially to build user base, with premium features introduced after reaching 10,000 active users

The decision to start with a free model acknowledges that users need to experience the simplicity and reliability of the core functionality before considering paid upgrades for convenience features.

### Growth Plan

User acquisition will focus on organic growth through:

1. **App store optimization** targeting users searching for "simple", "minimal", or "easy" Todo list applications
2. **Social media presence** showcasing the application's simplicity through before/after scenarios of complex vs. minimal task management
3. **Word-of-mouth referrals** from satisfied users who appreciate the lack of complexity
4. **Strategic partnerships** with productivity coaches and time management experts

User retention will be driven by reliability and consistency. By focusing on a narrow set of core functions and ensuring they work flawlessly, users will develop trust in the application as their go-to tool for basic task management.

### Success Metrics

Key performance indicators for the application's success include:

- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Target 2,500 within 6 months of launch
- **User Retention Rate**: 40% 30-day retention, 25% 90-day retention
- **Task Creation Rate**: Average of 5 tasks created per user per day
- **Task Completion Rate**: Target 60% of created tasks marked as completed
- **App Store Rating**: Maintain minimum 4.7/5.0 average rating
- **Crash Rate**: Less than 0.1% of sessions

These metrics focus on user engagement with the core functionality, measuring how effectively the application helps users manage their tasks.

## User Roles and Authentication

### User Role Definition

The Todo list application implements a single user role:

**User**: A person who creates, views, updates, and deletes their own tasks in the Todo list application

This role represents all individuals using the application for personal task management. The simplicity of the application is reflected in having only one user type, eliminating complexity in role management and permission handling.

### Authentication Flow Requirements

The application requires authentication to ensure data privacy and security. Each user's tasks are personal and should only be accessible to that individual.

#### Core Authentication Functions

- Users can register with email and password
- Users can log in to access their account
- Users can log out to end their session
- System maintains user sessions securely
- Users can verify their email address
- Users can reset forgotten passwords
- Users can change their password
- Users can revoke access from all devices

Authentication is necessary to prevent unauthorized access to personal task lists and to enable future features like cloud synchronization across devices.

### Authentication Technology

The system will implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication:

- **Access tokens**: Expire after 30 minutes for security
- **Refresh tokens**: Expire after 7 days, stored in httpOnly cookies
- **JWT payload**: Includes userId, role, and permissions array
- **Token refresh**: Automatic refresh when access token expires, requiring re-authentication after refresh token expiration

This approach balances security with user convenience, requiring frequent re-authentication for sensitive operations while allowing short-term access to the core functionality.

### Permission Matrix

| Action | User |
|--------|------|
| Create a new task | ✅ |
| View all tasks | ✅ |
| Mark a task as completed | ✅ |
| Delete a task | ✅ |
| View another user's tasks | ❌ |
| Edit another user's tasks | ❌ |
| Delete another user's tasks | ❌ |
| Create account | ✅ |
| Log in to account | ✅ |
| Log out of account | ✅ |
| Reset password | ✅ |
| Change password | ✅ |

The permission matrix reflects the application's focus on personal task management. Users have full control over their own tasks but no access to other users' data, maintaining privacy and data isolation.

## Core Functional Requirements

### Task Creation

Users need the ability to add new tasks to their list. This function serves as the starting point for task management and must be intuitive and efficient.

**WHEN** a user submits a new task with a description, **THE** system SHALL create a new task record with status "pending" and display the updated task list.

**THE** system SHALL validate that the task description is not empty before creation.

**IF** a user attempts to create a task with an empty description, **THEN THE** system SHALL prevent creation and display an error message "Task description cannot be empty."

**THE** system SHALL allow task descriptions up to 1,000 characters in length.

**THE** system SHALL trim leading and trailing whitespace from task descriptions before storage.

### Task Viewing

Users must be able to view all their tasks at any time. This function provides the primary interface for task awareness and prioritization.

**WHEN** a user accesses the task list, **THE** system SHALL retrieve all tasks associated with the user's account and display them in reverse chronological order (newest first).

**THE** system SHALL display each task's description and completion status.

**THE** system SHALL visually distinguish completed tasks from pending tasks (e.g., strikethrough text, different color).

**THE** system SHALL paginate results when more than 100 tasks exist, displaying 20 tasks per page by default.

**THE** system SHALL provide counters displaying the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.

### Task Completion

The ability to mark tasks as completed is essential for tracking progress and providing a sense of accomplishment. This function closes the loop on the task management cycle.

**WHEN** a user marks a task as completed, **THE** system SHALL update the task status to "completed" and refresh the display.

**WHEN** a user marks a completed task as pending, **THE** system SHALL update the task status to "pending" and refresh the display.

**THE** system SHALL allow users to toggle task completion status at any time.

**THE** system SHALL prevent modification of a task's description when changing completion status.

**THE** system SHALL process completion status changes within 2 seconds of user action.

### Task Deletion

Users need the ability to remove tasks they no longer need. This function helps maintain a clean, relevant task list.

**WHEN** a user requests to delete a task, **THE** system SHALL remove the task record from the database and update the display.

**THE** system SHALL not distinguish between deleting completed or pending tasks (same process for both).

**THE** system SHALL confirm deletion with the user before permanent removal when configured in confirmation mode.

**THE** system SHALL provide an undo option for deletions for 5 seconds after deletion.

**THE** system SHALL process task deletion within 2 seconds of user confirmation.

## Business Rules and Validation

### Input Validation

Input validation ensures data integrity and provides immediate feedback to users when they make errors.

**THE** task description input SHALL be validated for content before processing.

**THE** system SHALL reject empty task descriptions and display the message "Task cannot be empty. Please enter a description."

**THE** system SHALL accept alphanumeric characters, spaces, and standard punctuation marks (period, comma, exclamation point, question mark, semicolon, colon).

**THE** system SHALL reject task descriptions containing scripts, HTML tags, or special characters that could represent code injection attempts.

**THE** system SHALL truncate task descriptions exceeding 1,000 characters to 1,000 characters and notify the user that the description was shortened.

### System Behavior

The application follows specific behavioral patterns to ensure consistency and predictability for users.

**WHEN** a user creates a new task, **THE** system SHALL automatically assign a unique identifier and timestamp to the task.

**THE** system SHALL associate each task with the creating user's account identifier.

**THE** system SHALL initialize all new tasks with a status of "pending".

**THE** system SHALL allow only the task creator to modify or delete their tasks.

**THE** system SHALL prevent tasks from being transferred between users.

**THE** system SHALL not allow creation of duplicate tasks with identical descriptions in the same session.

**THE** system SHALL cache the task list locally to support offline access and instant display on application launch.

### Error Scenarios

The application handles various error conditions to maintain usability and prevent data loss.

**IF** a network connection is lost during task creation, **THEN THE** system SHALL queue the task locally and attempt to synchronize when connectivity is restored.

**IF** a network connection is lost during task status update, **THEN THE** system SHALL maintain the local change and synchronize when connectivity is restored.

**IF** a network connection is lost during task deletion, **THEN THE** system SHALL remove the task from local display and queue the deletion for synchronization.

**IF** the server returns an error during any operation, **THEN THE** system SHALL display a user-friendly message explaining the issue and suggesting retrying the operation.

**IF** a user attempts to access the application without authentication, **THEN THE** system SHALL redirect to the login page with a message "Please log in to access your tasks."

**IF** a user's session expires during use, **THEN THE** system SHALL prompt for re-authentication before continuing.

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times

Performance requirements focus on creating a responsive, fluid user experience that feels instantaneous.

**WHEN** a user loads the application, **THE** system SHALL display the task list within 3 seconds on a standard mobile device with normal network conditions.

**WHEN** a user creates a new task, **THE** system SHALL confirm creation and update the display within 1 second.

**WHEN** a user marks a task as completed, **THE** system SHALL update the display within 1 second.

**WHEN** a user deletes a task, **THE** system SHALL confirm deletion and update the display within 1 second.

**THE** system SHALL maintain response times under 3 seconds for all operations even with up to 1,000 tasks in a user's list.

### User Experience Expectations

The application should feel responsive and reliable under all normal usage conditions.

**THE** user interface SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions.

**THE** task list SHALL render smoothly when scrolling, even with large numbers of tasks.

**THE** system SHALL minimize battery consumption during normal operation to extend device usage time.

**THE** system SHALL optimize data usage for users with limited bandwidth or data plans.

**THE** application SHALL resume quickly from background state, restoring the task list within 2 seconds.

## Future Considerations

### Potential Extensions

While the current implementation focuses on minimal functionality, future versions could add selective features that maintain simplicity:

- **Offline mode**: Enhanced local storage and synchronization when connectivity returns
- **Multiple lists**: Separation of tasks by category (work, personal, shopping) without complex tagging
- **Reminders**: Simple time-based notifications for tasks (today, tomorrow, custom date)
- **Search**: Ability to find tasks by keyword within the user's list
- **Data export**: Option to export task history as a simple text file

Any future extensions would follow the principle of additive simplicity—only including features that solve clear user needs without introducing complexity.

### Scalability Outlook

The application architecture should support growth in user base and data volume:

- Database design SHALL accommodate millions of users and billions of tasks
- Authentication system SHALL support high-volume login requests during peak times
- API endpoints SHALL be designed for horizontal scaling
- Caching strategies SHALL minimize database load for read-heavy operations
- Data storage SHALL be optimized for the specific access patterns of task management

Scalability considerations ensure the application remains responsive and reliable as the user base grows, without compromising the core simplicity that defines the user experience.
