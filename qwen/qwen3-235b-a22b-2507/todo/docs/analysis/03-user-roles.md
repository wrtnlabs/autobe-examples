# Todo List Application - User Roles and Authentication Requirements

## Service Overview

The Todo list application is designed to provide users with a simple, intuitive tool for managing personal tasks. The application addresses a fundamental productivity need by allowing users to keep track of tasks they need to complete, providing a digital alternative to paper-based lists.

Core functionality is intentionally minimal: users can add tasks, view all tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. This focus on essential features ensures the application remains simple and accessible, particularly for non-technical users who need a straightforward tool without complex features like due dates, priorities, categories, or editing functionality.

## User Roles Overview

The system consists of a single authenticated user role: **User**. Authentication is required for all application functionality, as tasks are personal to each individual. The system does not support guest or anonymous access - users must create an account to use the application.

## User Role Definition

### User

The User role represents an individual who utilizes the Todo list application to manage their personal tasks. This is the only role in the system, as the application serves a personal productivity purpose rather than a collaborative one.

#### Responsibilities
- Creating new tasks to track activities they need to complete
- Viewing their complete list of tasks
- Marking tasks as complete when finished
- Removing tasks they no longer need
- Maintaining their account security (password management, etc.)

#### Limitations
- Users can only access and modify their own tasks
- Users cannot access or view tasks belonging to other users
- Users have no administrative capabilities
- Users cannot modify the application configuration or settings

### Detailed Permission Requirements

#### Task Management Permissions

WHEN a user attempts to create a new task, THE system SHALL allow the user to enter task description and save it to their personal task list.

WHEN a user attempts to view their tasks, THE system SHALL display all tasks associated with their account, including both pending and completed tasks.

WHEN a user attempts to mark a task as completed, THE system SHALL update the task status to "completed" and visually distinguish it in the task list.

WHEN a user attempts to delete a task, THE system SHALL remove the task from their personal task list permanently.

#### Authentication Permissions

WHEN a user accesses the application, THE system SHALL redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

WHEN a user submits registration information, THE system SHALL create a new account and allow the user to log in with their credentials.

WHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL authenticate the user and establish a session if credentials are valid.

WHEN a user requests to log out, THE system SHALL terminate the current session and return the user to the login page.

WHEN a user requests a password reset, THE system SHALL initiate the password recovery process by sending a reset link to their registered email address.

#### Security Restrictions

IF a user attempts to access another user's tasks, THE system SHALL deny access and return an appropriate error response.

IF a user attempts to modify another user's tasks, THE system SHALL deny the operation and maintain the integrity of the data isolation.

WHERE user account protection is concerned, THE system SHALL implement industry-standard security practices to prevent unauthorized access.

## Authentication Requirements

### Authentication Flow

The system shall implement a standard registration and login authentication flow with email/password credentials. All application functionality requires authentication, ensuring data privacy and security.

    I --> M[Delete Task]
    I --> N[Logout]
    N --> O[Terminate Session]
    O --> D
```

### Authentication Functions

#### User Registration

WHEN a new user accesses the application, THE system SHALL provide a registration option that collects email address and password.

WHEN a user submits registration information, THE system SHALL validate that the email address format is correct and that the password meets minimum security requirements.

WHEN a user successfully registers, THE system SHALL create a user account in the system and allow immediate login with the provided credentials.

WHEN a user registration requires email verification, THE system SHALL send a verification email to the provided address and restrict full functionality until verification is complete.

#### User Login

WHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL validate the email address format and password requirements.

WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, THE system SHALL authenticate the user, create a session, and redirect to the main application dashboard.

IF a user submits invalid login credentials, THEN THE system SHALL reject the login attempt and display an appropriate error message without specifying whether the email or password was incorrect.

WHEN a user successfully logs in, THE system SHALL generate an authentication token for subsequent API requests during the session.

#### Password Management

WHEN a user needs to reset their password, THE system SHALL provide a password recovery mechanism.

WHEN a user requests password recovery, THE system SHALL send a time-limited reset link to their registered email address.

WHEN a user accesses the password reset link, THE system SHALL allow them to create a new password that meets the system's security requirements.

WHEN a user changes their password successfully, THE system SHALL update the account credentials and require re-authentication for security purposes.

### Token Management

The system shall implement JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization. Tokens will be issued upon successful authentication and included in subsequent requests to validate user identity and permissions.

#### JWT Implementation Requirements

THE user authentication system SHALL use JWT tokens for session management.

THE JWT access token SHALL expire after 30 minutes of inactivity to minimize security risks.

THE JWT refresh token SHALL expire 7 days after issuance, requiring users to re-authenticate periodically.

THE JWT payload SHALL include userId, role ("user"), and permissions array for rapid authorization decisions.

THE JWT tokens SHALL be signed with a secure secret key that is stored securely in the environment configuration.

THE system SHALL provide token refresh functionality that allows users to obtain new access tokens without re-entering credentials when the refresh token is still valid.

#### Token Security

IF a JWT token is malformed or improperly signed, THEN THE system SHALL treat it as invalid and require re-authentication.

WHILE a user's session token is active, THE system SHALL validate the token on each request that requires authentication.

WHERE token storage is concerned, THE frontend application SHALL store tokens securely, preferably using httpOnly cookies to protect against XSS attacks.

IF a user explicitly logs out, THEN THE system SHALL invalidate the current session and render associated tokens unusable.

### Session Management

The system shall manage user sessions securely, implementing appropriate timeout mechanisms and providing users with control over their active sessions.

WHEN a user is inactive for 30 minutes, THE system SHALL expire the current session and require re-authentication.

WHEN a user successfully logs in, THE system SHALL establish a session that grants access to their personal task data.

WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL terminate the current session immediately and invalidate associated authentication tokens.

IF a user attempts to make a request with an expired token, THEN THE system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response and prompt for re-authentication.

## Business Model

### Why This Service Exists

The Todo list application exists to address a fundamental productivity challenge: the need to track and manage tasks that individuals need to complete. Research shows that writing down tasks improves memory retention and task completion rates. The application provides a digital solution that is more convenient than paper lists, accessible across devices, and reliable for daily use.

While many complex task management applications exist, there is a market gap for truly simple, focused applications that do very few things but do them exceptionally well. Users who are overwhelmed by feature-rich applications or who find them too complex can benefit from a minimalist approach that removes decision fatigue and cognitive load.

The service differentiates itself through extreme simplicity - by limiting functionality to only four core actions, the application becomes intuitive and accessible even to users with limited technical experience. This focused approach stands in contrast to competitors that offer extensive features like due dates, priorities, categories, reminders, collaboration features, and integrations.

### Target Users

The primary target users are individuals who need a simple tool to manage personal tasks, particularly:

- Non-technical users who feel intimidated by complex applications
- People who value simplicity and minimalism in their digital tools
