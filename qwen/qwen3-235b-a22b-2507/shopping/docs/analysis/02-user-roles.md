# User Roles and Permissions Specification for E-commerce Platform

## Introduction

This document defines the comprehensive user roles and permissions for the shoppingMall e-commerce platform. It outlines the business requirements for authentication, authorization, and role-based access control across all user types. The specifications focus on business logic and user capabilities without prescribing specific technical implementations, enabling backend developers to design a secure and functional access control system.

The platform supports four distinct user roles that reflect different user relationships with the marketplace: Customer, Seller, Administrator, and Guest. Each role has clearly defined permissions that align with their business function and responsibilities within the ecosystem.

## Customer Role Specifications

The Customer role represents registered users who purchase products through the shoppingMall platform. This role enables users to browse products, make purchases, and manage their shopping experience.

### Core Customer Capabilities

WHEN a customer has products they want to save for later consideration, THE system SHALL allow them to add products to their wishlist.

WHEN a customer has completed their product selection, THE system SHALL allow them to proceed to checkout and complete their purchase.

WHEN a customer wishes to manage their information, THE system SHALL allow them to view and edit their personal profile including shipping addresses.

WHEN a customer has completed orders, THE system SHALL allow them to track the status of their orders through the fulfillment lifecycle.

WHEN a customer has purchased a product, THE system SHALL allow them to submit a product review and rating for their purchase.

WHEN a customer has placed an order they wish to modify, THE system SHALL allow them to view their order history and, if eligible, request cancellation or modification.

### Profile and Address Management

WHEN a customer accesses their profile, THE system SHALL display their personal information including name, contact details, and order history.

WHEN a customer adds a new address, THE system SHALL allow them to save multiple addresses with labels (e.g., home, work) and designate one as primary.

WHEN a customer updates their profile information, THE system SHALL save changes and reflect them in subsequent transactions.

IF a customer has an existing saved address, THEN THE system SHALL allow them to edit or delete addresses from their address book.

IF a customer attempts to use an email address that already exists during registration, THEN THE system SHALL prevent account creation and display an appropriate message.

### Authentication Requirements

WHEN a customer registers with the platform, THE system SHALL collect email address, password, first name, and last name to create an account.

WHEN a customer submits registration information, THE system SHALL validate that the email address is properly formatted and unique before creating the account.

WHEN a customer completes registration, THE system SHALL send an email verification link to confirm the validity of the email address.

WHEN a customer clicks the email verification link, THE system SHALL activate their account and allow full access to customer features.

WHEN a customer attempts to log in, THE system SHALL authenticate using the provided email and password combination.

IF a customer provides invalid login credentials, THEN THE system SHALL return an appropriate error message without revealing whether the email or password was incorrect to prevent user enumeration.

WHEN a customer successfully authenticates, THE system SHALL generate a JWT token containing their user ID, role, and permissions.

WHEN a customer initiates a password reset, THE system SHALL send a time-limited reset token to their registered email address.

WHEN a customer uses a valid password reset token, THE system SHALL allow them to create a new password and update their account.

THE system SHALL invalidate used or expired password reset tokens to prevent unauthorized access.

### Order Management and Fulfillment

WHEN a customer proceeds to checkout with items in their cart, THE system SHALL require them to select a shipping address and payment method.

WHEN a customer submits an order, THE system SHALL generate a unique order number and send an order confirmation via email.

WHEN an order is confirmed, THE system SHALL display the order status and provide tracking information as it progresses through fulfillment stages.

WHEN a customer wishes to modify an order, THE system SHALL allow cancellation requests only if the order has not yet entered processing or shipping.

IF a customer requests an eligible cancellation, THEN THE system SHALL process a full refund to their original payment method.

WHEN a customer receives their order, THE system SHALL prompt them to review the products they purchased after a reasonable delivery period.

IF a customer submits a refund request within policy guidelines, THEN THE system SHALL process the refund according to platform policies and display the status in their order history.
