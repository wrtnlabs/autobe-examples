# E-commerce Shopping Mall Platform Requirements Analysis Report

## Business Model

### Why This Service Exists
The e-commerce shopping mall platform addresses the growing demand for online retail solutions that connect customers with multiple sellers in a unified marketplace. The platform fills a market gap by providing a comprehensive solution that combines product discovery, secure transactions, and seller management in a single system. With global e-commerce sales projected to reach $6.3 trillion by 2024, this platform capitalizes on the shift from traditional retail to digital marketplaces.

The platform differentiates itself from competitors through its multi-vendor approach, allowing various sellers to manage their inventory and sales independently while benefiting from the platform's established customer base, secure payment processing, and marketing reach. This creates a network effect where both customers and sellers benefit from increased platform activity.

### Revenue Strategy
The platform will generate revenue through multiple channels:
- Commission on each transaction (15% per sale)
- Subscription fees for premium seller accounts ($29.99/month)
- Featured listing promotions for sellers ($9.99-29.99 per week based on prominence)
- Logistics fee sharing for fulfillment services

Monetization will be phased: transaction commissions will be enabled from launch, premium subscriptions after reaching 500 active sellers, and promotional listings after achieving 10,000 monthly visitors.

### Growth Plan
User acquisition will focus on SEO optimization, targeted social media advertising, and referral programs. Seller recruitment will prioritize established small businesses with quality products but limited online presence. The platform will expand regionally, starting with domestic markets before international expansion.

### Success Metrics
- Monthly Active Users (MAU): Target 50,000 within 12 months of launch
- Daily Active Users (DAU): Target 15,000 within 12 months
- Average Order Value (AOV): Target $85
- Conversion Rate: Target 3.5% from view to purchase
- Seller Retention Rate: Target 85% month-over-month
- Customer Satisfaction Score: Target 4.5/5.0 in post-purchase surveys
