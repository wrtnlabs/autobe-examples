# Product Review and Rating System Requirements Specification

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete requirements for the product review and rating system in the shopping mall e-commerce platform. The review system enables customers to share their experiences with purchased products, providing valuable feedback for both prospective buyers and sellers. This specification covers all business requirements for review submission, verification, display, moderation, and integration with other platform features.

The review and rating system serves multiple purposes: building trust with potential customers through authentic user experiences, helping sellers improve their products based on customer feedback, enhancing product discovery through review-based filtering, and contributing to the platform's overall credibility. The system must balance openness with quality control, allowing genuine customer feedback while preventing abuse and maintaining content quality.

## Review Submission Requirements

### Customer Review Eligibility

THE system SHALL verify that customers have actually purchased a product before allowing them to submit a review. This prevents biased or fabricated reviews from competitors, sellers, or other non-customers.

WHEN a customer attempts to submit a review, THE system SHALL check their order history for completed transactions containing the product. Only customers with confirmed purchases can submit reviews.

THE system SHALL allow customers to submit exactly one review per product, regardless of the number of times they purchase it. This prevents manipulation of rating averages through multiple positive reviews.

IF a customer has purchased the same product multiple times, THEN THE system SHALL still limit them to a single review for that product, encouraging comprehensive feedback rather than multiple similar reviews.

### Review Submission Process

WHEN a customer accesses the review submission interface, THE system SHALL display a form with the following required fields:
- Star rating (1-5 stars, required)
- Review title (required, minimum 10 characters)
- Review content (required, minimum 50 characters)

THE review submission form SHALL also provide optional fields for:
- Product photos/videos from their experience
- Specific attribute ratings (quality, value, shipping speed)
- Purchase verification date

WHEN a customer submits a review, THE system SHALL save it with a "pending" status and make it visible to the customer but not to other users until approved.

THE system SHALL allow customers to edit or delete their reviews at any time before final approval from the moderation team.

### Technical Requirements for Review Content

THE system SHALL limit review text to a maximum of 5,000 characters to prevent excessively long content that may impact performance or user experience.

THE system SHALL support rich text formatting in reviews, allowing customers to use bold, italic, bullet points, and numbered lists to structure their feedback.

THE system SHALL allow customers to upload up to five media files per review, with a total size limit of 25MB for all files combined.

Media files SHALL be limited to common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF) and video formats (MP4) with resolution up to 4K for video content.

THE system SHALL automatically optimize uploaded images and videos for web display, creating appropriate thumbnails and lower-resolution versions for different device types.

## Review Verification and Moderation

### Automated Review Verification

THE system SHALL automatically verify that review authors have purchased the product being reviewed by cross-referencing the user's order history with the product ID.

THE system SHALL display a "Verified Purchase" badge on reviews from customers who bought the product through the platform, increasing trust in the review's authenticity.

THE system SHALL prevent customers from reviewing their own products, even if they made a purchase through their seller account.

THE system SHALL detect and flag patterns of suspicious review activity, including:
- Multiple five-star reviews submitted rapidly from the same IP address
- Reviews containing suspicious keywords or promotional language
- Accounts that only submit positive reviews with no purchase history
- Coordinated review campaigns across multiple accounts

### Review Moderation Workflow

THE system SHALL route all submitted reviews through a moderation workflow before making them publicly visible.

THE initial moderation step SHALL be automated, using content analysis algorithms to flag potentially problematic reviews based on language patterns, sentiment, and content type.

REVIEW status lifecycle:
1. Draft (customer is writing)
2. Submitted (awaiting moderation)
3. Under review (moderator is evaluating)
4. Approved (publicly visible)
5. Rejected (not published)
6. Archived (removed from public view)

WHEN a review is approved, THE system SHALL make it publicly visible and include it in rating calculations.

WHEN a review is rejected, THE system SHALL notify the customer with general feedback about why their review was not published, without disclosing specific moderator identities.

THE system SHALL allow moderators to request additional information from review authors before making approval decisions.

### Moderator Capabilities

THE moderator interface SHALL allow authorized staff to view all review submissions with complete context including:
- Review content and rating
- Product information
- Customer purchase history
- Submitted media files
- Previous reviews from the same customer
- Similar reviews for the same product

THE moderation system SHALL provide tools for moderators to filter and sort review submissions by:
- Submission date
- Product category
- Rating (to prioritize extreme ratings)
- Review length
- Media included
- Flagged issues

THE system SHALL allow moderators to approve, reject, or request changes to reviews with appropriate documentation of their actions.

THE moderator decisions SHALL be logged with timestamp, moderator identification, and reason for the decision to maintain accountability and support quality control of the moderation process.

## Review Display and User Interface Requirements

### Review Aggregation and Calculations

THE system SHALL calculate an overall product rating by averaging all approved, verified reviews for that product.

THE average rating SHALL be displayed as a 5-star rating with half-star increments (e.g., 4.5 stars) to provide meaningful differentiation.

THE system SHALL recalculate average ratings in real-time when new reviews are approved or existing reviews are updated or removed.

THE system SHALL display the total number of reviews next to the average rating to provide context about the rating's reliability.

THE system SHALL show rating distribution, displaying how many reviews have given each star rating (1-5) to help customers understand rating composition.

### Review Sorting and Filtering

THE system SHALL allow customers to sort product reviews by:
- Most recent
- Highest rated
- Lowest rated
- Most helpful (by user votes)
- Most recent with media
- Most helpful with media

THE default sorting shall be "Most recent" to encourage engagement with current customer experiences.

THE system SHALL allow filtering reviews by:
- Verified purchases only
- Reviews containing photos or videos
- Specific time periods (past 30 days, 6 months, year)
- Rating ranges (4-5 stars, 1-2 stars, etc.)

### User Ratings of Reviews

THE system SHALL allow customers to vote whether a review was helpful or not helpful in their purchase decision.

THE helpfulness voting SHALL not require customers to have purchased the product, encouraging engagement with the review system.

THE system SHALL display the total number of helpful votes for each review to help customers identify the most useful feedback.

THE help text for voting SHALL clarify that customers should vote based on whether the review was informative and helpful, not whether they agree with the rating.

THE system SHALL prevent customers from submitting multiple votes for the same review to maintain vote integrity.
