# Administrator Features Requirements Specification

## Introduction and Overview

This document specifies the requirements for the administrator features in the e-commerce shopping mall platform. The administrator role ("admin") has full access to manage all aspects of the platform including users, products, orders, and system settings. This document details the comprehensive capabilities required for the admin dashboard and management interface that will allow system administrators to effectively oversee and maintain the platform.

Administrators need powerful tools to monitor system health, manage content, resolve issues, and ensure smooth operation of the e-commerce platform. The admin features must provide comprehensive oversight while maintaining security and auditability of all administrative actions.

## User Management Requirements

### Administrator Access and Authentication

WHEN an administrator attempts to access the admin dashboard, THE system SHALL require multi-factor authentication using email/password credentials plus a time-based one-time password (TOTP).

THE administrator interface SHALL be accessible only through a dedicated admin subdomain (admin.shoppingMall.com) to separate it from the customer-facing application.

WHEN an administrator successfully authenticates, THE system SHALL generate a JWT token with an expiration of 30 minutes, and the payload SHALL include the administrator ID, role ("admin"), and full permission scope.

THE system SHALL log all administrator login attempts, including timestamp, IP address, and success/failure status, for security auditing purposes.

### User Account Management

THE administrator interface SHALL display a comprehensive user management console that allows administrators to view, search, and filter all user accounts in the system.

WHEN an administrator searches for users, THE system SHALL provide search functionality by customer name, email address, phone number, and registration date range.
