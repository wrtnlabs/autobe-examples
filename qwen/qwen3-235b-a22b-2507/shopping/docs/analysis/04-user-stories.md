# Requirements Analysis Report for Shopping Mall E-commerce Platform

## Business Model Overview

### Why This Service Exists
The e-commerce shopping mall platform addresses the growing demand for online retail solutions that connect multiple sellers with customers in a unified marketplace. With the global e-commerce market projected to reach $6.4 trillion by 2024, there is significant opportunity to create a platform that simplifies online shopping for customers while providing sellers with tools to manage their products and inventory effectively.

The platform fills several market gaps:
- Independent sellers lack affordable, comprehensive e-commerce solutions
- Customers face challenges comparing similar products across different vendor websites
- Small businesses need integrated tools for inventory, order management, and customer engagement

### Revenue Strategy
The platform will generate revenue through multiple streams:
- Commission on each transaction (10-15% of product value)
- Subscription fees for premium seller accounts
- Featured listing fees for product placement
- Delivery service markups

### Growth Plan
User acquisition will focus on onboarding established small businesses as initial sellers, creating critical mass of products to attract customers. Growth will be sustained through:
- Word-of-mouth from satisfied sellers and customers
- Performance-based digital marketing
- Partnership programs with logistics providers
- Referral incentives for both buyers and sellers

### Success Metrics
Key performance indicators will include:
- Monthly active customers (target: 50,000 in first year)
- Number of active sellers (target: 500 in first year)
- Average order value (target: $85)
- Order fulfillment rate (target: 98%)
- Customer retention rate (target: 40% repeat customers)
- Platform commission revenue (target: $2M annual)
