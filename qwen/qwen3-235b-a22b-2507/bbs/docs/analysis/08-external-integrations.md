# External Integrations and Third-Party Services Requirements

## 1. Introduction and Integration Strategy

This document specifies the external services and third-party integrations required for the economic/political discussion board platform. The integration strategy focuses on enhancing core functionality while maintaining system security, performance, and reliability. These integrations support critical features including user notifications, secure authentication, platform analytics, and content moderation.

The integration architecture follows a microservices pattern with isolated service boundaries. Each external integration operates through dedicated API gateways with standardized request/response patterns, error handling, and monitoring. The system employs circuit breaker patterns to maintain availability during external service outages and implements comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and security auditing.

### Business Justification

Integrating with established third-party services allows the discussion board to leverage specialized capabilities without developing them in-house, accelerating time to market and ensuring reliability. These services address complex domains like email delivery, social authentication, analytics processing, and content safety that would require significant development effort to build and maintain.

## 2. Notification Services Integration

### Email Notification Service

THE discussion board system SHALL integrate with a third-party email service provider to deliver user notifications. The system SHALL support transactional emails for registration, password reset, content moderation alerts, and engagement notifications.

WHEN a user registers an account, THE system SHALL trigger a confirmation email through the email service API within 5 seconds of successful registration.

WHEN a user requests password recovery, THE system SHALL send a secure password reset link via email within 30 seconds of the request.

WHEN a user's content is flagged by moderators, THE system SHALL notify the content creator via email within 1 minute of the moderation action.

WHEN a user receives a reply to their discussion thread, THE system SHALL send a notification email within 30 seconds of the reply being posted.

THE email service integration SHALL implement retry logic for failed deliveries, attempting redelivery 3 times with exponential backoff (1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes) before logging a permanent failure.

IF the email service API returns an error status, THEN THE system SHALL log the error with full context and notify the system administrators through the monitoring system.

THE system SHALL use template-based email content to ensure consistent branding and messaging across all notification types. Templates SHALL be stored externally and retrieved through a secure configuration service.

WHILE the email service is unavailable, THE system SHALL queue notification requests in a persistent message queue and process them when service is restored.

WHERE transactional priority levels are available, THE system SHALL classify registration and password reset emails as high priority, content notifications as medium priority, and promotional emails as low priority.

### Push Notification Service

THE system SHALL integrate with a mobile push notification service to deliver real-time alerts to users who have installed the companion mobile application.

WHEN new replies are posted to a discussion thread that a user is following, THE system SHALL send a push notification to the user's registered devices within 15 seconds.

THE push notification service SHALL support message throttling to prevent notification spam, limiting users to a maximum of 10 push notifications per hour from automatic triggers.

THE system SHALL allow users to customize their push notification preferences through the user settings interface, specifying which types of activities trigger notifications.

WHEN a user is mentioned in a discussion post or comment using the @username syntax, THE system SHALL send an immediate push notification with high priority.

THE push notification payload SHALL include sufficient context to be meaningful without requiring immediate app launch, including the discussion topic, author name, and snippet of the content.

## 3. Authentication Providers

### Social Authentication Integration

THE system SHALL support social login through major authentication providers to simplify user registration and improve conversion rates.

WHEN a user selects "Continue with Google", THE system SHALL initiate the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow with Google's authentication service, redirecting the user to Google's consent screen.

WHEN a user selects "Continue with Facebook", THE system SHALL initiate the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow with Facebook's authentication service, redirecting the user to Facebook's consent screen.

THE authentication flow SHALL request only the minimum required permissions from social providers: basic profile information and email address.

THE system SHALL verify the authenticity of social login tokens by validating their digital signatures using the provider's public keys, which SHALL be retrieved from the provider's well-known configuration endpoints.

IF a social authentication request fails due to invalid credentials or user cancellation, THEN THE system SHALL redirect the user back to the login page with an appropriate error message.

THE social authentication integration SHALL implement state parameters in OAuth requests to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

WHILE processing social authentication callbacks, THE system SHALL validate that the redirect URI matches the registered callback URLs for the specific provider.

THE system SHALL map social provider user IDs to internal user accounts, creating new accounts for first-time social login users and linking to existing accounts for returning users with matching verified emails.

WHERE users authenticate through social providers, THE system SHALL still enforce the same security policies and access controls as for locally authenticated users.

### Single Sign-On (SSO) Provider

THE system SHALL support enterprise SSO integration for organizational users who want to use the discussion board for policy analysis and economic forecasting.

WHEN an administrator enables SSO for their organization, THE system SHALL allow configuration of SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect with their identity provider.

THE SSO integration SHALL support Just-In-Time user provisioning, creating user accounts automatically when authenticated users from trusted domains first access the system.

THE system SHALL support SSO attribute mapping, allowing administrators to map identity provider attributes to user profile fields in the discussion board.

## 4. Analytics Tools

### Web Analytics Integration

THE system SHALL integrate with [Google Analytics](./07-non-functional-requirements.md) to track user engagement, content performance, and platform usage patterns.

WHEN users interact with discussion content, THE system SHALL send events to Google Analytics including page views, discussion views, comments posted, and voting actions.

THE analytics integration SHALL respect user privacy preferences, disabling tracking when users have opted out of analytics collection in their privacy settings.

THE system SHALL implement custom event tracking for key user journeys, including the registration funnel, content creation process, and moderation workflow.

THE analytics data SHALL be used to identify popular topics, measure user retention, and understand engagement patterns across different user segments.

WHEN a user deletes their account, THE system SHALL anonymize their historical analytics data within 72 hours by removing personally identifiable information while preserving aggregate usage patterns.

THE system SHALL track conversion rates for key actions, including registration completion, first post creation, and return visit frequency.

WHERE analytics data shows declining user engagement in specific features, THE system SHALL generate internal reports for the product team to investigate potential improvements.

### Business Intelligence Integration

THE system SHALL integrate with a business intelligence platform to generate comprehensive reports on discussion trends, user growth, and content quality metrics.

THE business intelligence integration SHALL extract anonymized data sets daily for analysis, including discussion volume by category, user activity patterns, and moderation statistics.

WHEN generating monthly business reports, THE system SHALL aggregate data on key performance indicators including active users, content creation rates, and community health metrics.

THE system SHALL provide data exports in standard formats (CSV, JSON) for offline analysis by research teams studying economic and political discourse patterns.

## 5. Content Moderation APIs

### Automated Content Moderation Service

THE discussion board system SHALL integrate with a third-party AI-powered [content moderation service](./06-business-rules.md) to automatically screen user-generated content for policy violations.

WHEN a user submits a new discussion or comment, THE system SHALL send the content to the moderation API for analysis before making it publicly visible.

THE content moderation API SHALL scan for hate speech, offensive language, personal attacks, and other forms of toxic content based on predefined community standards.

THE system SHALL use the moderation service's confidence scores to determine content visibility, automatically rejecting content with toxicity scores above 0.8, flagging content between 0.6-0.8 for moderator review, and allowing content below 0.6 to be published immediately.

WHEN content is flagged by the automated system, THE system SHALL notify the moderation team through their dashboard and include the specific policy violations detected.

THE system SHALL maintain a feedback loop with the moderation API, providing confirmation of human moderator decisions to help improve the AI's accuracy over time.

IF the content moderation API is unavailable, THEN THE system SHALL queue submissions for asynchronous processing and notify submitters that their content is awaiting review due to system maintenance.

THE automated moderation system SHALL support language detection and analysis for multilingual content, with initial support for English, Korean, and Spanish discussions.


### Spam Detection Service

THE system SHALL integrate with a specialized spam detection service to identify and prevent spam posts and comment flooding.

WHEN a user submits content, THE system SHALL send it to the spam detection API which SHALL analyze for spam patterns including keyword stuffing, link spam, and automated posting behavior.

THE spam detection integration SHALL analyze user behavior patterns, considering factors such as posting frequency, content similarity across posts, and account age.

THE system SHALL implement a reputation-based filtering system that adjusts spam sensitivity based on user trust levels, with stricter filtering for new accounts and more lenient filtering for established users with positive contribution histories.

WHEN the spam detection service identifies likely spam, THE system SHALL prevent immediate publication and route the content to a quarantine queue for moderator review.

THE system SHALL maintain a global spam rule database that is updated weekly based on emerging spam patterns identified by the detection service.

## 6. Error Handling for External Services

### Service Availability Requirements

THE integration system SHALL implement robust error handling for all external service interactions to maintain platform reliability despite third-party failures.

WHEN an external service returns a 5xx server error, THE system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic with a maximum of 5 retries over a 10-minute period.

WHEN an external service returns a 4xx client error, THE system SHALL log the error and, if possible, correct the request format or parameters before subsequent attempts.

THE system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns for all external integrations, temporarily halting requests to failing services and returning graceful fallback responses to users.

IF the failure duration exceeds 30 minutes, THEN THE system SHALL notify system administrators and initiate fallback procedures, such as disabling non-essential notifications while maintaining core functionality.

THE system SHALL provide health status indicators for external services in the administrator dashboard, showing current availability, response times, and error rates.

### Fallback and Degraded Operation

THE system SHALL maintain functionality during external service outages by implementing appropriate fallback mechanisms.

WHILE the email notification service is unavailable, THE system SHALL store notification requests in a persistent queue and deliver them when service is restored, with a maximum retention period of 72 hours.

WHEN the content moderation API is temporarily unavailable, THE system SHALL allow discussion submissions, mark them as pending review, and notify submitters of delayed publication.

THE system SHALL disable non-essential analytics tracking during extended outages but maintain core functionality and logging.


THE platform SHALL display appropriate status messages to users when features relying on external services are temporarily degraded.

### Monitoring and Alerting

THE system SHALL implement comprehensive monitoring for all external integrations, tracking success rates, response times, and error patterns.

WHEN the error rate for any external service exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window, THE system SHALL trigger an alert to the operations team.

THE system SHALL generate weekly reports on integration performance, including uptime percentages, average response times, and notable incidents.

THE monitoring system SHALL maintain historical data on external service performance to inform future architecture decisions and provider selection.

## 7. Security and Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection Requirements

THE system SHALL comply with GDPR, CCPA, and relevant data protection regulations in all external integrations.

THE integration with third-party services SHALL minimize data sharing, transmitting only information necessary for the specific service function.

THE system SHALL encrypt sensitive data in transit using TLS 1.3 and SHALL avoid storing sensitive third-party credentials in the application database.

WHEN integrating with external services, THE system SHALL use API keys with least-privilege permissions and SHALL rotate keys quarterly.

THE system SHALL implement service account isolation, using separate credentials for each external integration to prevent cross-service access in case of compromise.

### Compliance and Auditing

THE system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs for all external service interactions, recording request details, responses, and processing outcomes.

THE audit logs SHALL be retained for a minimum of 13 months to support security investigations and compliance requirements.

THE integration system SHALL support data subject access requests, allowing users to retrieve information about what data has been shared with third-party services.

WHEN required by law or regulatory request, THE system SHALL be able to demonstrate compliance with data protection requirements for all external integrations.
