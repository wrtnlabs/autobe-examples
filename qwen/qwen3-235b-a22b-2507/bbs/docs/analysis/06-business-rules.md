# Business Rules for Economic/Political Discussion Board

This document outlines the comprehensive business rules that govern the behavior of the economic/political discussion board platform. These rules define the constraints, policies, and operational guidelines that ensure civil discourse, maintain content quality, and provide a structured environment for users to engage in political and economic discussions.

## Business Model Context

### Why This Service Exists
THE economic/political discussion board SHALL create a structured environment for meaningful discourse on socioeconomic and political topics. IF unmoderated discussions lead to toxic environments, THEN THE system SHALL implement tiered user roles and moderation capabilities to maintain civil discourse. IF important discussions become buried in content overload, THEN THE system SHALL implement voting mechanisms and intelligent sorting to highlight valuable contributions.

WHILE misinformation spreads easily in online forums, THE system SHALL encourage evidence-based discussions by providing citation tools and content verification features. WHEN users encounter conflicting viewpoints, THE system SHALL structure conversations to promote understanding rather than confrontation.

### Revenue Strategy
WHILE the core discussion functionality SHALL remain free to access, THE system SHALL implement a freemium model with premium features for power users and organizations. WHERE user engagement reaches significant scale, THE system SHALL generate revenue through premium subscriptions, sponsored research partnerships, targeted non-intrusive advertising, and grants from foundations supporting democratic discourse.

### Growth Plan
THE system SHALL pursue user acquisition through organic growth, partnerships with educational institutions, strategic content marketing focused on the value of civil discourse, and integration with existing academic and policy research networks.

### Success Metrics
THE system SHALL measure success through key performance indicators including daily active users, average session duration, discussions created per day, comments per discussion, user retention, report resolution time, and user satisfaction score as specified in the service overview.

## Content Rules

### Content Creation and Ownership
THE system SHALL allow users to create discussions on economic or political topics following specific guidelines to ensure quality and relevance. Discussions must be substantive and contribute to meaningful discourse rather than serving as platforms for personal attacks or superficial commentary.

### Discussion Lifecycle
THE system SHALL maintain discussions indefinitely unless removed through moderation or user deletion.

THE system SHALL allow the original author to delete their own discussions within 7 days of creation.

3. **Temporary Suspension**: For repeated or severe violations
   - THE system SHALL prevent the user from posting for a defined period
   - THE system SHALL provide specific guidelines for returning to good standing

### User Reporting System
THE system SHALL allow users to report inappropriate content through a streamlined process.

WHEN a user reports content, THE system SHALL:
1. Record the report with timestamp and reason
2. Notify moderators of the report
3. Allow the reporting user to provide additional context
4. Prevent the reporting user from making duplicate reports on the same content

THE system SHALL categorize reports into types:

## Business Rules Summary

### Core Principles
The discussion board operates on several core principles that guide all business rules:

1. **Civil Discourse**: Promoting respectful exchange of ideas over confrontation
2. **Evidence-Based Discussion**: Encouraging factual accuracy and citation of sources
3. **Quality over Popularity**: Prioritizing argument quality over agreement metrics
4. **Transparency**: Making moderation processes and voting systems clear to users
5. **Accountability**: Ensuring users are responsible for their contributions

### User Journey Alignment
THE system SHALL ensure that business rules support the user journey from guest to active participant to trusted contributor. Rules are designed to lower barriers to entry while gradually introducing more responsibility as users become more engaged.

### Business Logic Flow
The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the core business logic flow for content submission and moderation:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A["User Creates Discussion"] --> B["System Validates Content"]
  B --> C{"Meets Basic Criteria?"}
  C -->|"Yes"| D["Publish to Appropriate Category"]
  C -->|"No"| E["Request Revisions"]
  D --> F["Users Engage with Content"]
  F --> G["Voting and Discussion"]
  G --> H{"Moderation Triggered?"}
  H -->|"No"| I["Continue Normal Engagement"]
  H -->|"Yes"| J["Moderator Review Process"]
  J --> K{"Violation Confirmed?"}
  K -->|"Yes"| L["Apply Moderation Action"]
  K -->|"No"| M["Inform User, No Action"]
  L --> N["Notify Affected User"]
  N --> O["Record in Moderation History"]
```

### Data Flow Constraints
THE system SHALL ensure that user data is handled in compliance with privacy regulations.

THE system SHALL anonymize voting data for analysis purposes.

THE system SHALL provide users with the ability to export their contribution history.

THE system SHALL provide users with the ability to delete their account and associated personal data.

### Business Rule Enforcement
THE system SHALL implement automated validation for certain business rules at the application level.

THE system SHALL use machine learning algorithms to flag potential violations for moderator review.

THE system SHALL provide administrators with dashboards to monitor rule compliance and system health.

THE system SHALL generate regular reports on business rule effectiveness and community health metrics.

### Future Business Rule Considerations
- Implementation of reputation systems based on consistent high-quality contributions
- Introduction of structured debate formats with timed responses
- Development of topic expertise verification for certain discussion areas
- Integration with fact-checking databases for automated source verification
