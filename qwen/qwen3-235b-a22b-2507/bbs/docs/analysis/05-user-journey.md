# User Journey Analysis Report: Economic/Political Discussion Board

## Service Overview and Business Model

### Why This Service Exists
This economic/political discussion board fills a critical gap in the digital public sphere by providing a structured platform for civil discourse on complex societal issues. Current platforms often devolve into polarized echo chambers or unmoderated flame wars, while academic forums remain inaccessible to the general public. Our service creates a balanced environment where:

- Users can engage with diverse perspectives on economic policies and political ideologies
- Discussions are structured to promote logical argumentation over emotional rhetoric
- Expertise is valued but accessibility is maintained for informed citizens

The platform serves as a digital town square for democratic engagement, supporting informed civic participation in an era of increasing political polarization and misinformation.

### Revenue Strategy
The platform will operate on a freemium model with the following revenue streams:
- Basic access and participation: free for all registered users
- Premium membership: $4.99/month for advanced features (in-depth analytics, enhanced personalization, ad-free experience)
- Institutional subscriptions: $99/month for educational institutions and think tanks (classroom management tools, research datasets)
- Non-intrusive, contextually relevant advertising: 15% of page view impressions

### Growth Plan
User acquisition will proceed through three phases:
1. **Seed phase**: Partner with political science departments and economics blogs to generate initial content
2. **Growth phase**: Target users through political event coverage and economic policy debates
3. **Maturity phase**: Expand into related topics (social policy, environmental economics) while maintaining core focus

### Success Metrics
Primary KPIs will include:
- Daily Active Users (DAU): Target 5,000 within 12 months
- Discussion Completion Rate: 70% of initiated threads reach substantive conclusion
- User Retention: 40% of users return weekly after first month
- Content Diversity: Maximum 60% of content from any single political ideology
- Moderation Response Time: 90% of reports addressed within 24 hours

```

#### Scenario Details

**Discovery Phase**

WHEN a potential user discovers the platform through search or referral, THE system SHALL display public discussions with highlighted diverse perspectives.

THE system SHALL prominently display the value proposition: "Engage in civil economic and political discourse with informed citizens."

**Registration Process**

WHEN a guest user clicks the registration button, THE system SHALL present a streamlined registration form with only email and password fields.

THE system SHALL send an email verification link to the provided address within 1 minute of registration.

WHEN a user clicks the verification link, THE system SHALL automatically log them in and redirect to profile setup.

**Profile Setup**

THE system SHALL request minimal profile information: preferred name, primary areas of interest (economics, domestic policy, foreign affairs, etc.), and political perspective spectrum (left, center-left, center, center-right, right).

THE system SHALL emphasize that political perspective is used only for content personalization and moderation balance, with all user identities otherwise private.

**First Engagement**

After profile setup, THE system SHALL guide new users to three curated discussions matching their interests.

THE system SHALL provide a tutorial overlay highlighting key interaction elements: posting, commenting, voting, and reporting.

THE system SHALL limit the first post to 300 words to encourage concise argumentation.

### Content Creation Flow

The content creation flow enables users to initiate discussions on economic and political topics with structured formats that promote civil discourse.

    end
```

#### Discussion Types

The system supports three types of structured discussions:

1. **Policy Debate**: Focused on specific legislative proposals or economic policies
2. **Ideological Comparison**: Examination of different political philosophies or economic theories
3. **Event Analysis**: Discussion of current political events with historical and policy context

WHEN a registered user initiates a new discussion, THE system SHALL require selection of one of the three discussion types.

THE system SHALL display appropriate argumentation guidelines based on the selected discussion type.

#### Content Guidelines

THE system SHALL enforce the following content rules for all discussions:

- Posts SHALL be limited to 1,000 words maximum

- Users SHALL avoid ad hominem attacks and personal insults

WHEN a user submits a post containing ad hominem language, THE system SHALL flag it for review and notify the user of community guidelines.

THE system SHALL provide real-time feedback on post structure, highlighting missing elements like supporting evidence or proper citation.

#### Publication Process

WHEN a user submits a discussion post, THE system SHALL perform automated content analysis for policy terminology, economic indicators, and argument structure.

THE system SHALL assign relevant tags based on content analysis for discovery and moderation purposes.

THE system SHALL publish the discussion immediately to the relevant category, with instant notification to followers.

### Moderation Process

The moderation process ensures civil discourse while protecting free expression. The system employs a graduated approach with user reports, automated detection, and human moderation.

```

#### Voting Mechanics

THE system SHALL implement a dual-axis voting system:

- **Agreement Scale**: Range from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree
- **Quality Assessment**: Binary upvote/downvote on argument quality regardless of agreement

WHEN a user votes on content, THE system SHALL record both agreement stance and quality assessment separately.

THE system SHALL prevent users from changing their vote after submission to ensure stability of engagement metrics.

#### Visibility and Ranking

THE system SHALL rank content based on a composite score that considers:

- Number of quality upvotes (more significant than agreement votes)
- Diversity of agreement (content receiving votes from across the political spectrum ranks higher)
- Engagement depth (length and quality of responses)
- Author reputation

THE system SHALL promote content with balanced agreement across ideological lines, even with moderate overall engagement.

#### Reputation System

THE system SHALL calculate user reputation based on:

- Quality votes received on their content
- Number of civil discussions initiated
- Community moderation ratings
- Educational contributions (verified factual claims, useful citations)

WHERE user reputation exceeds community thresholds, THE system SHALL grant additional privileges:

- Ability to moderate low-severity reports
- Influence in content ranking algorithms
- Early access to new features
- Recognition as trusted contributor
