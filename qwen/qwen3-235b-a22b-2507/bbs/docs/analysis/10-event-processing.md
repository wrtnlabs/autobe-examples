# Requirements Analysis Report: Economic/Political Discussion Board

## 1. Service Overview and Business Model

### Why This Service Exists
The economic/political discussion board fills a critical gap in the digital public discourse landscape, providing a structured platform for civil conversations on socioeconomic and political issues. As online discourse becomes increasingly polarized and toxic, this platform creates a space for users to engage in meaningful dialogue, share diverse perspectives, and deepen their understanding of complex societal challenges. The service counters the trend of unproductive online arguments by implementing structural incentives for constructive participation, evidence-based reasoning, and respectful disagreement.

The platform differentiates itself from existing social media by focusing exclusively on quality discussion rather than engagement metrics. While platforms like Reddit or Twitter host political discussions, they often lack the specialized features needed to support high-quality socioeconomic discourse. Our solution combines academic rigor with community engagement, creating a unique space between academic journals and general social media for substantive dialogue accessible to the general public.

### Target Users
The discussion board serves multiple user segments with varying levels of engagement and expertise:
- General citizens interested in political and economic issues
- Students and academics studying social sciences
- Policy professionals and public sector employees
- Journalists and media professionals
- Educators using the platform for teaching civic discourse

### Revenue Strategy
The platform follows a sustainable business model that supports long-term operation while maintaining independence and editorial integrity:

WHILE the core discussion functionality SHALL remain free to access, THE system SHALL generate revenue through:
- Premium subscriptions ($9.99/month) offering ad-free experience, advanced analytics, and exclusive content
- Institutional subscriptions ($99/month) for universities, think tanks, and media organizations with administrative controls
- Sponsored research partnerships with academic institutions studying public discourse patterns
- Non-intrusive, contextually relevant advertising focused on educational and civic organizations
- Grants from foundations supporting democratic discourse and public education

THE system SHALL prioritize user experience and discourse quality over monetization, delaying aggressive revenue generation until achieving critical user engagement metrics.

### Growth Plan
THE system SHALL pursue organic growth through:
- Partnerships with educational institutions for academic use
- Strategic content marketing focused on civil discourse and civic education
- Integration with academic and policy research networks
- Community-driven organic growth via user referrals and content sharing

WHERE user engagement reaches threshold levels, THE system SHALL expand category offerings and introduce specialized discussion formats. WHILE building community trust, THE system SHALL gradually introduce additional user roles and privileges based on contribution quality and length of participation.

### Success Metrics
THE system SHALL measure success through comprehensive key performance indicators:

| Metric | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Daily Active Users | 5,000 within 12 months | Daily |
| Average Session Duration | 12 minutes | Daily |
| Discussions Created per Day | 200 | Daily |
| Comments per Discussion | 8 | Daily |
| User Retention (30-day) | 45% | Weekly |
| Report Resolution Time | < 4 hours | Daily |
| User Satisfaction Score | 4.2/5.0 | Monthly |

THE system SHALL track these metrics to evaluate platform health and identify areas for improvement. WHEN metrics indicate specific challenges, THE system SHALL trigger review processes to consider feature adjustments or policy changes.

## 4. Authentication Requirements

### Core Authentication Functions
THE system SHALL implement these authentication capabilities for all user roles:

- Users can log in to access their account
- Users can log out to end their session
- System maintains user sessions securely
- Users can verify their email address
- Users can reset forgotten passwords
- Users can change their password
- Users can revoke access from all devices
- System detects and handles concurrent sessions
- Authentication attempts are rate-limited to prevent abuse

### JWT Token Structure
THE system SHALL use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management with the following payload structure:

```json
{
  "userId": "string (UUID format)",
  "role": "string (enum: guestUser, registeredUser, moderator, administrator)",
  "permissions": "array of strings representing specific permissions",
  "iat": "number (issued at timestamp)",
  "exp": "number (expiration timestamp)",
  "emailVerified": "boolean"
}
```

Token expiration requirements:
- Access token: 15 minutes
- Refresh token: 7 days
- Refresh token rotation on each use
- Refresh token invalidation after logout
- Blacklist mechanism for compromised tokens

### Role-Based Access Control
THE system SHALL implement role-based access control with these principles:

- All API endpoints require authentication token verification
- Requested actions are validated against user's role permissions
- Users cannot escalate their own privileges
- Permission checks occur at the service layer, not just API gateway
- Failed permission attempts are logged for security audit
- Temporary permission elevation requires explicit approval
- Permission changes take effect immediately across all services

### Security Requirements
THE system SHALL meet these security standards for user authentication:

- Passwords stored with bcrypt or equivalent strong hashing
- HTTPS enforcement across all authentication endpoints
- Protection against common OAuth threats (CSRF, token leakage)
- Regular security audits of authentication systems
- Monitoring for suspicious login patterns
- Immediate notification of successful logins from new devices
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- Support for secure password recovery workflows

### Error Handling
THE system SHALL handle authentication errors appropriately:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Authentication Error"] --> B{"Error Type"}
    B -->|"Invalid Credentials"| C["Return 401 Unauthorized"]
    B -->|"Expired Token"| D["Return 401 with token_expired code"]
    B -->|"Invalid Token"| E["Return 401 with token_invalid code"]
    B -->|"Insufficient Permissions"| F["Return 403 Forbidden"]
    B -->|"Rate Limit Exceeded"| G["Return 429 Too Many Requests"]
    C --> H["Log attempt, do not reveal which field was incorrect"]
    D --> I["Prompt for re-authentication"]
    E --> J["Treat as unauthorized access attempt"]
    F --> K["Provide generic permission denied message"]
    G --> L["Wait before retry"]
```
