# Requirements Analysis Report: Economic/Political Discussion Board

## 1. Service Overview and Business Model

### Why This Service Exists
THE discussion board platform SHALL create a structured environment for constructive discourse on economic and political topics, addressing the current degradation of online discussion quality. WHEN users engage in political and economic discussions, THE system SHALL facilitate civil dialogue through structured formats, balanced representation, and community moderation. IF unmoderated discussions lead to polarized echo chambers, THEN THE system SHALL intervene through moderation tools and balanced algorithms to maintain constructive dialogue.

THE service fills a market gap for a platform that combines free expression with quality controls, enabling nuanced discussion of complex societal issues without devolving into toxic discourse. WHEN political events generate intense public interest, THE system SHALL provide a space for informed debate rather than emotional reactions. WHERE misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, THEN THE system SHALL implement fact-checking tools and source verification to promote evidence-based discussion.

### Target Users
THE platform SHALL serve multiple user segments with varying expertise and engagement levels:

- **Civically engaged citizens** seeking to deepen their understanding of policy issues
- **Students and academics** studying political science, economics, and public policy
- **Policy professionals and analysts** requiring a forum for professional discourse
- **Journalists and media professionals** researching public opinion on policy issues
- **Educators** using the platform as a teaching tool for political and economic concepts

### Revenue Strategy
THE platform SHALL implement a freemium business model with multiple revenue streams:

- **Basic features** SHALL be free for all registered users
- **Premium subscriptions** SHALL offer enhanced features (advanced analytics, ad-free experience, priority content visibility) for $4.99/month
- **Institutional subscriptions** SHALL be available for educational organizations ($99/month for classroom management tools and research datasets)
- **Non-intrusive advertising** SHALL be displayed to free users (15% of impressions, contextually relevant to civic engagement)
- **Partnerships** SHALL be established with think tanks and research organizations for sponsored content sections

### Growth Plan
THE user acquisition strategy SHALL proceed through three distinct phases:

1. **Seed phase** (Launch - Month 3): Partner with university political science departments and economics blogs to generate initial high-quality content
2. **Growth phase** (Months 4-9): Target users through coverage of major political events and policy debates to increase user base
3. **Maturity phase** (Month 10+): Expand into related policy areas while maintaining core focus on economic and political discourse

### Success Metrics
THE system SHALL track the following key performance indicators to measure platform success:

| Success Metric | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|----------------|--------|---------------------|
| Monthly Active Users | 5,000 | Monthly |
| User Retention (30-day) | 40% | Weekly |
| New Discussions per Day | 100 | Daily |
| Comments per Discussion | 8 | Daily |
| Moderation Response Time | < 24 hours | Daily |
| User Satisfaction Score | 4.0/5.0 | Monthly |
| Content Diversity Index | Minimum 60/40 split across ideological spectrum | Weekly |
