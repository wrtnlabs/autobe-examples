IF a search query returns more than 1,000 results, THEN THE system SHALL limit displayed results to the 100 most relevant matches while indicating total count.

WHERE complex search filters are applied (e.g., date range, user, category), THE system SHALL return results within 1.5 seconds.

### Concurrent User Capacity

THE system SHALL support 1,000 concurrent users actively participating in discussions during peak hours.

THE system SHALL support 10,000 concurrent users with read-only access during peak traffic periods.

IF the number of concurrent users exceeds 1,500 active participants, THEN THE system SHALL maintain core functionality with response times not exceeding 3 seconds.

### Server Response and Throughput

THE server SHALL process 100 discussion post submissions per minute during sustained peak usage.

THE server SHALL process 500 comment submissions per minute during sustained peak usage.

THE server SHALL handle 1,000 vote actions per minute across all discussions.

WHERE a discussion thread becomes highly active with more than 10 new comments per minute, THE system SHALL update the thread in real-time without loss of submissions.

## 2. Security Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization Security

THE authentication system SHALL implement industry-standard password hashing using bcrypt with a minimum cost factor of 12.

THE password reset mechanism SHALL generate single-use, time-limited tokens that expire after 15 minutes.

THE system SHALL implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute force attacks, allowing maximum 5 failed attempts per IP address within 15 minutes.

WHEN rate limiting is triggered, THE system SHALL respond with HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status code and appropriate error message.

THE session management system SHALL issue securely generated session identifiers with sufficient entropy to prevent guessing attacks.

THE system SHALL support secure token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API access.

### Data Protection

THE system SHALL encrypt all stored user passwords using strong cryptographic hashing.

THE system SHALL implement HTTPS for all communications between client and server using TLS 1.3 or higher.

THE system SHALL implement appropriate CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies to prevent unauthorized cross-site requests.

THE system SHALL sanitize all user-generated content before storage and display to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

THE user data storage SHALL comply with applicable data protection regulations, including provisions for user data access, modification, and deletion.

### Content Security

THE system SHALL implement content moderation mechanisms to identify and prevent the posting of malicious content.

THE system SHALL scan file uploads for malware and other security threats.

THE system SHALL limit file upload sizes to prevent denial-of-service attacks through resource exhaustion.

THE system SHALL implement appropriate content security policies (CSP) to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

## 3. Scalability Requirements

### Horizontal Scalability

THE system SHALL be designed to support horizontal scaling by adding additional server instances to handle increased load.

THE application components SHALL be stateless to facilitate load balancing across multiple instances.

THE system SHALL support containerized deployment to enable rapid scaling of infrastructure resources.

### Database Scalability

THE database design SHALL support read replicas to distribute read queries across multiple database nodes.

THE system SHALL implement appropriate indexing strategies to maintain query performance as data volume grows.

THE data architecture SHALL support data partitioning strategies for large datasets, particularly for user activity logs and discussion analytics.

THE system SHALL maintain query response times under 2 seconds for discussion retrieval operations with up to 1 million total discussions.

THE system SHALL maintain query response times under 2 seconds for user search operations with up to 100,000 registered users.

### Traffic Pattern Accommodation

THE system SHALL accommodate traffic patterns characteristic of discussion boards, where certain topics may experience viral growth and sudden spikes in participation.

THE caching strategy SHALL effectively handle "hot" content that receives disproportionate traffic and engagement.

THE system SHALL implement queue-based processing for non-critical operations to maintain responsiveness during traffic spikes.

THE notification system SHALL be capable of handling burst delivery of notifications when popular discussions receive multiple concurrent responses.

### Growth Projections

THE system SHALL support growth from initial launch to 50,000 registered users within the first 12 months.

THE system SHALL support daily discussion creation of up to 1,000 new threads when at full projected capacity.

THE system SHALL support daily content contribution of up to 25,000 new comments when at full projected capacity.

THE system SHALL accommodate storage growth of approximately 50GB per year based on projected content creation rates.

## 4. Availability Requirements

### Uptime and Reliability

THE system SHALL maintain 99.5% uptime over any rolling 30-day period.

THE system SHALL implement appropriate monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to service outages.

THE system SHALL provide status reporting functionality to communicate service availability to users during maintenance or outages.

### Disaster Recovery

THE system SHALL implement automated backup procedures for all critical data with backups performed at least daily.

THE database backup strategy SHALL support point-in-time recovery to minimize data loss in the event of failure.

THE system SHALL maintain offline or geo-replicated backups to protect against catastrophic data center failures.

THE recovery process SHALL enable restoration of service within 4 hours in the event of a complete system failure.

### Maintenance and Updates

THE system SHALL support rolling updates that allow deployment of new versions without service interruption.

THE system SHALL implement feature flags to enable gradual rollout of new functionality and quick disablement if issues arise.

THE system SHALL provide administrative interfaces for managing maintenance windows and service status announcements.

## 5. System Integration Considerations

### Notification Services

THE system SHALL integrate with email delivery services to support account verification, password reset, and discussion notifications.

THE notification system SHALL support rate limiting to prevent overwhelming users with excessive notifications.

THE user notification preferences SHALL be configurable, allowing users to specify the types and frequency of notifications they receive.

### Third-Party Authentication

THE system SHALL support integration with major social identity providers for user registration and login.

THE third-party authentication integration SHALL follow industry-standard protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0) for secure user data exchange.

### Analytics Integration

THE system SHALL integrate with web analytics services to track user engagement, traffic patterns, and feature usage.

THE analytics implementation SHALL respect user privacy and provide opt-out mechanisms where required by regulations.

THE system SHALL track key engagement metrics including discussion creation rates, comment participation, session duration, and return visit frequency.
