## Subscription System Requirements Analysis

This document provides comprehensive business requirements for the subscription system in our Reddit-like community platform. The subscription system enables users to follow specific communities of interest, receive notifications about new content, and maintain a personalized feed of subscribed content.

THE subscription system SHALL be a core component of the platform, enabling users to curate their content experience by selecting communities aligned with their interests. This functionality directly supports the platform's business model of user engagement and content discovery.

### Business Model Context

The subscription system supports our core business model by increasing user engagement and retention. By allowing users to follow topics of interest, we create personalized experiences that encourage daily visits and sustained participation. This drives higher ad impressions and creates opportunities for premium features such as advanced notification controls or priority content delivery.

Subscription-based engagement creates network effects where active users attract more contributors, leading to better content and community growth. This virtuous cycle supports our revenue strategy through increased user lifetime value and platform stickiness.

### Business Objectives

- Increase user engagement by providing personalized content streams
- Drive daily active users through notification mechanisms
- Enable topic-based community discovery and content organization
- Provide moderation teams with tools to manage subscriber communications
- Support platform growth through organic content discovery
- Enhance content relevance and contribution quality
- Minimize information overload through selective content filtering

## User Role Structure and Authentication Requirements

### Core Authentication Functions

- Users must authenticate to subscribe to communities
- Subscription status is tied to user accounts, not devices or sessions
- Users can view their subscriptions across devices through account sync
- Users can manage all active sessions from account security settings
- Guest users (unauthenticated) can browse public communities but cannot subscribe
- Members can subscribe to communities after email verification
- Community moderators have additional subscription-related privileges
- Administrators have full access to subscription systems and analytics

### User Role Hierarchy

THE system SHALL implement the following user role hierarchy:

- Guest: Unauthenticated users who can only view public communities and posts
- Member: Authenticated users who have verified their email and can access full platform features
- Community Moderator: Members with additional privileges to manage specific communities
- Admin: Platform staff with full system access and oversight capabilities

### Authentication Requirements

WHEN a user attempts to subscribe to a community, THE system SHALL verify authentication status before processing.

WHEN a user is not authenticated, THE system SHALL redirect to the login page and preserve the subscription intent for after authentication.

WHEN a user completes authentication, THE system SHALL resume the intended action (subscription to the community).

WHEN a user attempts to access subscription management features, THE system SHALL verify authentication and appropriate role permissions.

### User Roles and Permissions

THE system SHALL enforce role-based access control for all subscription-related actions.

## Edge Cases and Business Rules

### Subscription Limitations

THE system SHALL allow users to subscribe to a maximum of 1,000 communities to maintain system performance.

WHEN a user reaches the subscription limit, THE system SHALL display a message suggesting they unsubscribe from inactive communities.

THE system SHALL allow administrators to adjust the subscription limit based on system capacity.

WHEN a user attempts to exceed the subscription limit, THE system SHALL prevent the action and display guidance on managing subscriptions.

THE system SHALL consider the subscription limit on a per-user basis, not shared across devices or sessions.

THE system SHALL provide metrics in user profiles showing subscription count versus maximum.

### Community Deletion and Status Changes

IF a community is deleted, THEN THE system SHALL automatically unsubscribe all members and remove it from their feed.

IF a community changes from public to private, THEN THE system SHALL automatically unsubscribe users who do not have access.

IF a community is suspended by moderators or administrators, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily disable notifications but retain subscription status.

WHEN a suspended community is reinstated, THE system SHALL resume normal subscription functionality and deliver missed notifications based on user settings.

IF a community is marked as "inactive" due to lack of participation, THEN THE system SHALL notify subscribers and suggest unsubscribing.

WHEN a community is transferred to new ownership, THEN THE system SHALL maintain subscription status for all existing subscribers.

IF a community merges with another community, THEN THE system SHALL notify subscribers and ask whether they want to subscribe to the new combined community.

IF a community splits into multiple communities, THEN THE system SHALL allow subscribers to choose which new communities to follow.

### Data Integrity and Sync

THE system SHALL synchronize subscription data across devices within 5 seconds of change.

THE system SHALL ensure transactional integrity when recording subscription changes to prevent data inconsistencies.

THE system SHALL audit all subscription changes for security monitoring and abuse detection.

THE system SHALL maintain subscription history for at least 2 years for compliance and recovery purposes.

THE system SHALL detect and resolve conflicts when subscription changes occur simultaneously on multiple devices.

THE system SHALL provide users with a subscription audit log showing their subscription history.

THE system SHALL ensure atomicity of subscription operations to prevent partial application of changes.

THE system SHALL provide reconciliation processes for subscription data after system outages.

## Error Scenarios and Recovery

### Connectivity Issues

IF network connectivity is lost during subscription attempt, THEN THE system SHALL queue the request and retry when connection is restored.

IF persistent connectivity issues prevent subscription sync, THEN THE system SHALL notify the user and provide manual sync option.

WHEN connectivity is restored after an outage, THE system SHALL synchronize all pending subscription changes in the correct order.

### Conflicting Actions

WHEN a user attempts to subscribe and unsubscribe simultaneously through different devices, THE system SHALL prioritize the most recent action and synchronize across devices.

WHEN conflicting subscription actions occur, THE system SHALL log the event for moderation review if it exceeds normal thresholds.

THE system SHALL detect potential race conditions in subscription operations and implement appropriate locking mechanisms.

### System Errors

IF the subscription system fails to process a request, THEN THE system SHALL return a specific error code and descriptive message.

IF the notification system fails to deliver messages, THEN THE system SHALL queue notifications for later delivery and monitor delivery success rates.

IF the feed generation system fails, THEN THE system SHALL display cached feed content with appropriate status messages.

WHEN recovering from system failures, THE subscription system SHALL preserve the last known consistent state.

## Success Metrics and KPIs
