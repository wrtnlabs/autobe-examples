# Reddit-Like Community Platform - Requirements Analysis Report

## Service Vision & Overview

THE community platform SHALL be a Reddit-inspired content sharing and discussion system that enables users to create specialized communities, share content, engage in discussions, and build reputation through participation. The platform SHALL facilitate knowledge sharing, community building, and content discovery through user-driven curation and voting mechanisms.

### Why This Service Exists

The platform addresses the growing need for specialized online communities where users can connect around shared interests, expertise, and passions. Unlike general social networks, this platform SHALL focus on topic-specific communities (subreddits) that foster deeper, more meaningful discussions. The service SHALL solve the problem of content fragmentation across multiple platforms by providing a unified space for community formation, content sharing, and discussion.

Competitors include existing platforms like Reddit, Discord, and various forum software, but this service SHALL differentiate itself through a more intuitive user experience, advanced content discovery algorithms, and robust community management tools that empower moderators to effectively steward their communities.

## Core Features

WHEN a user attempts to log in, THE system SHALL authenticate credentials and establish a user session.

### Community Creation and Management

THE platform SHALL support the creation of topic-specific communities (subreddits) that operate as independent discussion forums within the larger ecosystem.

THE system SHALL support multiple levels of nesting to facilitate complex discussions while maintaining readability.

### Post Sorting and Discovery

THE system SHALL display posts in chronological order when sorted by "new" to show recently created content.

THE system SHALL rank posts by their total score when sorted by "top" to display the most popular content.
