# Non-Functional Requirements for Discussion Board Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the non-functional requirements for the economic/political discussion board platform. These requirements focus on the quality attributes that ensure positive user experience and reliable platform operation. While functional requirements define what the system does, these non-functional requirements specify how well the system performs those functions from a user perspective.

All requirements are expressed in natural language using user experience terms, with measurable criteria where applicable. These specifications support the platform's business objective to provide a reliable, efficient forum for thoughtful economic and political discussions.

WHEN users first access the discussion board, THE system SHALL present a clean, professional interface that clearly indicates the platform's purpose for economic and political discourse.

THE platform SHALL maintain consistent performance standards across different devices and connection speeds to ensure equitable access to civic discussions.

IF users spend more than 30 seconds composing a response, THE system SHALL automatically save drafts at 5-minute intervals.

THE platform SHALL provide clear feedback for all user actions, including loading states, success confirmations, and error messages with resolution guidance.

## Security Considerations

Security requirements address user trust and confidence in participating in sensitive economic and political discussions. These standards ensure participants feel safe sharing their perspectives without fear of inappropriate exposure or misuse of their information.

WHEN users register accounts, THE system SHALL validate and protect their personal information against unauthorized access.

THE platform SHALL use clear visual indicators to show when discussions are moderated versus open participation.

IF suspicious activity is detected during account creation, THE system SHALL implement additional verification steps without discouraging legitimate users.

WHEN users log out of their accounts, THE system SHALL immediately terminate their access session across all devices.

THE discussion board SHALL maintain a clear privacy policy explaining how user contributions may be used for discussion purposes only.

WHEN users delete their own discussions or responses, THE system SHALL permanently remove the content within reasonable timeframes.

THE platform SHALL provide users with control over their notification preferences to prevent unwanted communication.

IF users report inappropriate content, THE system SHALL respond with acknowledgment within 24 hours and investigation within 3 business days.

THE discussion board SHALL protect against automated spam posting that could flood political discussion threads.

WHEN users change their passwords, THE system SHALL enforce complexity requirements and prevent reuse of previous passwords.

THE platform SHALL implement rate limiting for all user actions to prevent abuse while allowing normal discussion participation.

IF users receive multiple login failure attempts, THE system SHALL temporarily lock the account and provide clear unlock procedures.

THE discussion board SHALL provide secure password recovery mechanisms that don't expose user information during the reset process.

WHEN handling sensitive user data like email addresses, THE system SHALL encrypt the information both in transit and at rest.

THE platform SHALL log security events for audit purposes while protecting individual user privacy in log contents.

IF a security breach is detected, THE system SHALL notify affected users within 24 hours and provide guidance on protective measures.

## Scalability Requirements

Scalability requirements ensure the platform can accommodate growing discussion participation and increased public interest in economic and political topics. These standards support the business goal of becoming an important forum for civic discourse.

WHEN discussion interest surges during major economic events, THE system SHALL handle increased simultaneous users without degrading response times.

THE platform SHALL accommodate growing numbers of discussion threads and responses over time without requiring users to navigate more complex structures.

IF daily active discussions triple during major political events, THE system SHALL maintain performance standards for all participants.

THE storage capacity SHALL scale to support discussion threads that grow to thousands of responses each.

WHEN user registration rates increase rapidly, THE system SHALL process new accounts without delays that could discourage participation.

THE search capabilities SHALL remain fast even as the total content database grows significantly.

THE platform SHALL support increased moderator workloads during periods of high discussion activity without requiring additional interface complexity.

THE platform SHALL provide backup access methods, such as mobile-optimized views, during periods of high demand.

## Success Criteria and Measurement

The platform's success in meeting these non-functional requirements will be measured through user satisfaction metrics and operational monitoring. Business stakeholders should monitor these indicators quarterly to ensure the discussion board evolves to maintain high quality standards.

WHEN performance standards are not met, THE system SHALL provide alternative access methods to prevent complete loss of discussion capability.

THE platform documentation SHALL be updated annually to reflect evolving user expectations and technological possibilities.

Business monitoring of response times, user complaints, and participation rates SHALL guide investment in quality improvements.

Economic and political discussions represent important civic engagement opportunities. This platform must provide the reliability and usability that participants expect from critical communication tools. Regular review of these non-functional requirements against actual user experience metrics will ensure the discussion board remains a trusted forum for thoughtful discourse.
