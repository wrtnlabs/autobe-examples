# Discussion Board Functional Requirements

## Introduction

This document defines the functional requirements for the Simple Economic/Political Discussion Board system. The platform enables users to engage in discussions on economic and political topics through topics and responses. The requirements are specified using natural language and the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format where applicable, ensuring clarity for backend developers. All requirements focus on business logic, user interactions, and validation rules without specifying technical implementation details.

The discussion board operates as a business service that fosters informed discussions on economic and political issues. Users can be anonymous visitors browsing content, registered members creating and participating in discussions, or moderators managing the platform.

Business objectives include:
- Providing a space for civil discourse on economic and political topics
- Enabling user-generated content with moderation to maintain quality
- Supporting user registration, authentication, and role-based access
- Delivering real-time search and filtering capabilities for content discovery
- Implementing notifications to keep users engaged with relevant discussions

SYSTEM ROLES:
- Guest users: Can browse discussions but cannot post or interact
- Registered users: Can create topics, post responses, and moderate their own content
- Moderators: Can manage all content and users beyond basic post management

These requirements ensure the system meets user expectations for functionality while maintaining data integrity and appropriate access controls.

For detailed user scenarios that inform these requirements, refer to the [User Scenarios Document](./03-discussionBoard-userScenarios.md).
For the underlying business rules governing these functions, refer to the [Business Rules Document](./05-discussionBoard-businessRules.md).

All requirements in this document are expressed in natural language or EARS format to avoid ambiguity.

## Discussion Management Requirements

Discussion management encompasses the creation, display, and organization of discussion topics. Topics serve as the primary containers for economic and political discussions, allowing users to initiate conversations on specific subjects.

### Topic Creation
WHEN a user attempts to create a discussion topic, THE system SHALL validate the topic title meets minimum length requirements of 10 characters and maximum length of 200 characters.
WHEN the user submits the topic, THE system SHALL validate the input format and uniqueness.  
IF the topic title is empty or exceeds 200 characters, THEN THE system SHALL prevent submission and display appropriate error message.  
IF the topic description exceeds 1000 characters, THEN THE system SHALL truncate the content or prevent submission.  
WHEN a topic is successfully created, THE system SHALL assign it a unique identifier, timestamp the creation, and associate it with the creator's account.  

WHEN a user creates a topic without authentication, THE system SHALL redirect to login with a message about registration requirements.
WHEN a registered user submits a topic with invalid characters, THE system SHALL display specific validation errors for each field.
WHEN the topic content contains prohibited content, THE system SHALL flag it for moderator review before publishing.

### Topic Display
THE discussion board SHALL display topics in reverse chronological order (newest first) on the main page.  
WHEN a guest or registered user views the topic list, THE system SHALL show topic title, creator name, creation date, response count, and last activity timestamp.

WHEN a user's content is voted highly, THE system SHALL consider sending recognition notifications.

WHEN users follow specific users, THE system SHALL notify them of those users' activities.
WHEN topics reach popularity thresholds, THE system SHALL notify interested users.
WHEN responses receive significant votes, THE system SHALL send engagement notifications.

### Notification Preferences
WHEN a registered user configures settings, THE system SHALL allow enabling/disabling different notification types.  
THE system SHALL support notification delivery through in-platform alerts and email options.  
WHEN users opt out, THE system SHALL respect preferences and avoid sending unwanted notifications.

WHEN users configure granular preferences, THE system SHALL allow different settings for mentions vs. responses.
WHEN notification preferences change, THE system SHALL immediately apply them to future events.
WHEN email delivery fails, THE system SHALL fallback to in-platform notifications.

### Notification Display
WHEN users access the platform, THE system SHALL show recent notifications in a dedicated panel.  
WHEN notifications accumulate unread, THE system SHALL indicate count with visual indicators.  
WHEN users mark notifications read, THE system SHALL update status and potentially archive old notifications.

WHEN notifications exceed 50 unread, THE system SHALL group them by type and show summaries.
WHEN users access notification history, THE system SHALL provide date-ordered archive view.
