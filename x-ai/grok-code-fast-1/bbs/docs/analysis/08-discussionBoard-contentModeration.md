# Content Moderation and Administration Framework for Discussion Board

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the comprehensive business requirements for content moderation within the economic and political discussion board platform. The moderation system ensures quality discourse while protecting users from harmful content, implementing scalable workflows that balance human oversight with automated tools. All specifications focus on business logic and user experience outcomes rather than technical implementation details.

The platform operates as a moderated community space for economic and political discussions, requiring robust moderation capabilities to maintain quality and safety standards. Moderators serve as administrators with escalated privileges to manage content, enforce policies, and handle violations, supporting the business goal of fostering informed, respectful conversations on civic matters.

WHEN inappropriate content is submitted to the platform, THE moderation system SHALL detect and handle violations through graduated enforcement processes.

WHILE users participate in discussions, THE platform SHALL maintain moderation capabilities that promote constructive dialogue and prevent harm.

## Moderation Objectives

### Business Goals for Content Moderation

WHEN the discussion board launches, THE moderation system SHALL establish trust by immediately handling inappropriate content submissions.

WHEN community standards are established, THE moderation system SHALL clearly communicate rules to prevent violations and guide proper behavior.

WHEN moderators review content, THE platform SHALL provide efficient tools to maintain high-quality discussions without excessive overhead.

WHEN users report violations, THE moderation system SHALL respond promptly to address concerns and maintain community health.

### Content Policy Framework

WHEN defining content policies, THE platform SHALL prohibit speech that incites violence, discrimination, or direct threats against individuals.

WHEN economic or political content is submitted, THE platform SHALL allow vigorous debate while prohibiting misinformation that could cause harm.

WHEN users submit content, THE moderation system SHALL validate against published community guidelines before public visibility.

WHEN content violates standards, THE platform SHALL implement clear escalation procedures ranging from warnings to account restrictions.
