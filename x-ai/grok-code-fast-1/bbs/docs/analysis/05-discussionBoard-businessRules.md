# Business Rules Specification for Economic and Political Discussion Board

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive business logic, validation rules, and operational constraints governing the economic and political discussion board system. These rules ensure consistent content quality, user behavior standards, and data integrity while supporting moderated community interactions. All specifications focus on business requirements and user experience outcomes rather than technical implementation details.

## Content Validation Rules

### Discussion Topic Validation

WHEN a user attempts to create a discussion topic, THE system SHALL validate the topic title meets minimum length requirements of 10 characters and maximum length of 200 characters.

WHEN a user submits a topic title, THE system SHALL reject titles containing prohibited words or phrases defined in the content policy.

WHEN a topic is submitted without a valid title, THE system SHALL return a validation error indicating the title requirement.

WHEN a topic body is submitted, THE system SHALL ensure it contains at least 50 characters and does not exceed 10,000 characters.

IF the topic category selection is not one of the predefined economic or political categories, THEN THE system SHALL reject the submission with a category validation error.

### Response and Comment Validation

WHEN a user posts a response to a discussion topic, THE system SHALL validate the response content contains meaningful text of at least 20 characters.

WHEN a response includes links, THE system SHALL validate that all URLs follow standard HTTP/HTTPS formats.

WHEN a comment is submitted that consists primarily of repeated characters or symbols, THE system SHALL reject it as spam content.

IF a response contains more than 3 external links, THEN THE system SHALL mark it for moderator review before public display.

### Content Format and Structure Rules

THE system SHALL enforce plain text or basic markup formatting only for discussion content, excluding executable code or scripts.

WHEN content parsing detects HTML tags or script elements, THE system SHALL sanitize or reject the content automatically.

THE system SHALL preserve line breaks and paragraph formatting in discussion content during display.

## User Behavior Rules

### Authentication and Activity Tracking

WHEN a guest user attempts to create content, THE system SHALL redirect to the registration or login process.

WHILE a user is authenticated, THE system SHALL track their posting frequency to prevent abuse patterns.

IF a user posts more than 5 new topics within a 24-hour period, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily restrict new topic creation for that user.

### Interaction and Reputation Rules

WHEN a user votes up or down on a discussion, THE system SHALL prevent users from voting on their own content.

THE system SHALL limit each user to one vote per discussion topic or response.

WHEN users report abusive content, THE system SHALL accumulate reports and escalate to moderators when threshold of 3 reports is reached.

IF a user accumulates more than 10 reports within a 7-day period, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily suspend their commenting privileges.

### Account Management Behavior

WHEN a user changes their display name, THE system SHALL prevent names containing offensive language or impersonating other users.

THE system SHALL allow users to edit their posts within 30 minutes of initial publication.

WHEN users delete their own content, THE system SHALL mark it as deleted rather than removing it permanently from the database.

## Moderation Rules

### Content Review Process

WHEN new discussion topics are submitted, THE system SHALL hold them in pending status for moderator approval before making them publicly visible.

WHILE a topic is in pending status, THE system SHALL display a "under review" message to the author.

THE moderators SHALL have 24 hours to review pending content, after which unapproved content escalates.

WHEN moderators approve content, THE system SHALL immediately make it visible in the discussion feed and notify the author.

### Violation Handling Procedures

IF content violates community guidelines regarding hate speech or misinformation, THEN THE system SHALL allow moderators to remove the content and warn the user.

WHEN users receive their first warning, THE system SHALL send a notification explaining the violation and community standards.

IF users receive three warnings within 30 days, THEN THE system SHALL suspend their account for 7 days.

WHEN accounts are suspended, THE system SHALL prevent all posting and commenting activities until suspension period ends.

### Appeal and Resolution Process

WHEN users appeal moderation decisions, THE system SHALL provide a form for submitting evidence and reasons.

THE moderators SHALL review appeals within 48 hours and communicate final decisions via email.

WHEN appeals are denied, THE system SHALL provide clear reasoning and potential paths for reinstatement.

## Data Integrity Rules

### Unique Content Management

THE system SHALL prevent duplicate discussion topics with identical or nearly identical titles.

WHEN duplicate content is detected, THE system SHALL redirect users to the existing discussion instead of creating new ones.

### Historical Data Preservation

WHEN content is moderated or removed, THE system SHALL maintain audit logs of the original content and moderation actions.

THE system SHALL preserve all discussion threads and responses even when authors delete their accounts.

WHEN discussions expire based on activity rules, THE system SHALL archive them rather than delete them.

### Relationship Integrity

THE system SHALL maintain proper linking between discussion topics, responses, and user accounts.

WHEN user accounts are modified, THE system SHALL update all associated content attribution automatically.

THE system SHALL prevent orphaned responses that exist without associated parent discussions.

## Operational Constraints

### Content Lifecycle Management

THE system SHALL retire inactive discussions with no responses after 90 days by moving them to an archive category.

WHEN discussions receive significant activity (more than 50 responses), THE system SHALL pin them to featured sections.

THE system SHALL limit each discussion to a maximum of 500 direct responses to maintain usability.

### Performance and Volume Constraints

WHEN search queries return more than 100 results, THE system SHALL paginate the results with 25 items per page.

THE system SHALL limit API requests from individual users to 60 per minute to prevent system overload.

WHEN peak usage exceeds server capacity, THE system SHALL implement automatic throttling based on user priority.

### Business Hours and Support

THE moderator team SHALL respond to flagged content within 12 business hours.

WHEN users contact support, THE system SHALL provide estimated response times of 24-48 business hours.

THE system SHALL operate 24/7 but schedule maintenance windows only during low-usage hours (2:00-4:00 AM local time).

## Conclusion

These business rules establish a framework for maintaining quality discourse while enabling free expression within the economic and political discussion board. The validation and moderation processes described above balance automation with human oversight to create a trustworthy platform. All rules are designed to scale with user growth while maintaining clear boundaries on acceptable behavior.

Implementation of these rules requires careful consideration of user experience impacts and transparent communication of community guidelines. The rules serve as the foundation for building trust and engagement within the user community.
