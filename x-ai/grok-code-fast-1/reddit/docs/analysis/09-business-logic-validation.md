# Business Logic and Validation Requirements

## Overview
This document specifies the business logic validations, input rules, and user interaction workflows for the Reddit-like community platform. It defines the core business rules that govern system behavior, ensuring consistent and expected user experiences across all platform features. All requirements are presented in natural language with EARS format for clarity, focusing on business outcomes rather than technical implementation.

Key focus areas include validation of user inputs, enforcement of business rules, error condition handling, and success criteria for interactions. These requirements ensure the platform maintains integrity, fairness, and usability while supporting all user roles: guest, member, and moderator.

## Input Validation Rules

### Registration Input Validation
WHEN a user submits registration credentials, THE system SHALL validate that the email address follows proper email format with domain validation.  
WHEN a user submits registration credentials, THE system SHALL validate that the password meets minimum complexity requirements of 8 characters with mix of letters and numbers.  
WHEN a user submits registration credentials, THE system SHALL validate that the username is between 3-20 characters and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.  
IF an email address is already registered, THEN THE system SHALL reject the registration attempt and display a clear message about email availability.  
IF a username violates character constraints, THEN THE system SHALL reject the registration and suggest valid username formats.

### Login Input Validation
WHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL validate that the provided email or username exists in the system.  
WHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL validate that the provided password matches the stored password.  
WHEN a user submits login credentials with invalid format, THEN THE system SHALL return appropriate validation messages without revealing account existence.

### Community Creation Input Validation
WHEN a moderator creates a community, THE system SHALL validate that the community name is unique and between 3-21 characters.  
WHEN a moderator creates a community, THE system SHALL validate that the description is less than 500 characters and appropriate for public display.  
WHEN a community name contains special characters beyond allowed formats, THEN THE system SHALL reject creation and provide examples of valid names.

### Post Creation Input Validation
WHEN a member posts content, THE system SHALL validate that text posts are not empty and under 40,000 characters.  
WHEN a member posts content, THE system SHALL validate that links are valid URLs with proper protocols (http/https).

### Subscription Input Validation
WHEN a user subscribes to a community, THE system SHALL validate that the community exists and is accessible.  
WHEN a user unsubscribes, THE system SHALL validate that the subscription exists to prevent duplicate actions.
