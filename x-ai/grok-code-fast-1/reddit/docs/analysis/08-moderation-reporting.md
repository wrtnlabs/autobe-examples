# Moderation and Reporting System Requirements

## Overview

This document specifies the business requirements for the moderation and reporting system in the Reddit-like community platform. The system enables users to report inappropriate content and provides moderators with tools to review and resolve these reports. All requirements follow business logic focused on maintaining platform integrity while supporting user engagement.

## Report Types

Reportable content categories include:

- **Spam**: Unsolicited promotional content or repetitive posts designed to manipulate engagement
- **Harassment**: Content that threatens, insults, or intimidates users
- **Hate Speech**: Content promoting discrimination or violence based on protected characteristics
- **Adult Content**: Explicit material posted in inappropriate communities
- **Misinformation**: Deliberately false information that could harm users or society
- **Copyright Infringement**: Content that violates intellectual property rights
- **Other**: Content that doesn't fit other categories but violates platform rules

WHEN a user submits a report, THE system SHALL validate that the selected report type is valid and matches the reported content.

WHEN a report type is "Other", THE system SHALL require a mandatory description from the reporter.

## Reporting Process

### Report Submission

WHEN a member or moderator views a post or comment, THE system SHALL display a "Report" button next to the content.

WHEN a user clicks the Report button and is not authenticated as a member, THE system SHALL redirect them to the login page and return to the report form after authentication.

WHEN an authenticated member submits a report, THE system SHALL require selection of a report type and allow optional additional details up to 500 characters.

WHEN a report is submitted, THE system SHALL immediately hide the reported content from the reporter's view only.

WHEN a moderator submits a report, THE system SHALL assign it to their own moderation queue automatically.

WHEN a report is created, THE system SHALL log the reporter's user ID, reported content ID, timestamp, report type, and optional description.

### Duplicate Report Handling

WHEN a report is submitted for content that already has a pending report of the same type, THE system SHALL add the reporter to the list of supporters but not create a duplicate report.

WHEN multiple users report the same content for different reasons, THE system SHALL create separate report records for each unique report type.

WHEN a user attempts to report content they already reported, THE system SHALL show a message indicating "You have already reported this content" without creating a new report.

## Moderation Queue

### Queue Access

WHEN a moderator logs in, THE system SHALL display their moderation queue showing all assigned pending reports.

WHEN a moderator views the queue, THE system SHALL show reports sorted by priority: new reports first, then by report type severity, then by timestamp.

WHEN a report is created, THE system SHALL assign it to moderators of the community where the content was posted.

WHEN no specific community moderators exist, THE system SHALL assign reports to general platform moderators.

### Report Details Display

WHEN a moderator opens a report, THE system SHALL display:
- Full reported content (post or comment)
- Reporter's username (anonymized if requested)
- Report timestamp
- Report type and description
- Additional reporter notes
- Community context
- Previous moderation history for the content
- List of all users who reported this content

WHEN viewing reported content, THE system SHALL allow moderators to navigate to the full thread context without leaving the moderation interface.

## Resolution Workflow

### Review and Decision Process

WHEN a moderator reviews a report, THE system SHALL provide decision options:
- Dismiss (no action required)
- Remove (delete content)
- Approve (content is appropriate)

WHEN a moderator chooses to remove content, THE system SHALL require a mandatory reason selected from: inappropriate content, spam, rule violation, or custom explanation.

WHEN a moderator selects "custom explanation", THE system SHALL require a text reason between 10-200 characters.

WHEN a decision is made, THE system SHALL update the report status and record the moderator's user ID, decision, reason, timestamp.

WHEN content is removed, THE system SHALL replace it with a notice stating "This content has been removed for violating community rules" visible to all users except the content author.

WHEN content is removed, THE system SHALL prevent the original author from seeing their removed content in their profile.

WHEN a report is dismissed, THE system SHALL restore any temporary hiding of content from the reporter.

WHEN a report is resolved, THE system SHALL notify the reporter of the outcome via platform notification.

WHEN a report results in content removal, THE system SHALL notify the content author of the removal and reason.

### Automated Actions

WHEN content receives multiple reports of the same type within 24 hours, THE system SHALL automatically increase the report's priority level.

WHEN a user's posting restriction expires, THE system SHALL restore full posting capabilities.

WHEN a user accumulates 3 content removals within 30 days, THE system SHALL automatically apply a temporary posting restriction for 7 days.

WHEN a user accumulates 3 content removals within 30 days, THE system SHALL automatically apply a temporary posting restriction for 7 days.

WHEN a user accumulates 3 content removals within 30 days, THE system SHALL automatically apply a temporary posting restriction for 7 days.

WHEN a user accumulates 3 content removals within 30 days, THE system SHALL automatically apply a temporary posting restriction for 7 days.

## Appeals Process

### Appeal Submission

WHEN a content author receives a removal notification, THE system SHALL provide an "Appeal" button in the notification.

WHEN a user clicks Appeal, THE system SHALL display a form requiring explanation of why the content should be restored, up to 1000 characters.

WHEN an appeal is submitted, THE system SHALL limit users to maximum 2 pending appeals at any time.

WHEN an appeal is submitted, THE system SHALL assign it to a different moderator than the one who made the original decision when possible.

### Appeal Review

WHEN assigned, THE system SHALL add the appeal to the moderator's queue marked as "appeal" priority.

WHEN reviewing an appeal, THE system SHALL display:
- Original content (redacted if sensitive)
- Original report details
- Removal reason
- Author's appeal explanation
- Moderation history
- Community rules reference

WHEN a moderator reviews the appeal, THE system SHALL provide options:
- Uphold removal
- Restore content
- Escalate to senior moderator

WHEN restoring content via appeal, THE system SHALL require the moderator to provide a reason for reversal.

WHEN an appeal decision is made, THE system SHALL notify the appellant of the outcome within 24 hours.

WHEN content is restored via appeal, THE system SHALL immediately make it visible again and remove any posting restrictions caused by the original infraction.

WHEN an appeal is denied, THE system SHALL provide the appellant an additional appeal option that routes directly to senior moderation staff.

WHEN a user appeals the same content multiple times, THE system SHALL notify senior staff automatically if the user accumulates 3 failed appeals.

WHEN an appeal decision is made, THE system SHALL notify the appellant of the outcome within 24 hours.

## Business Rules and Validation

THE system SHALL prohibit users from reporting their own content.
