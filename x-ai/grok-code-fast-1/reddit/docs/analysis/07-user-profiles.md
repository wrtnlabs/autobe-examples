# User Profiles Requirements for Community Platform

## Overview of User Profile System

User profiles in the Reddit-like community platform serve as public-facing representations of authenticated users, displaying their activity, reputation, and contributions to build community trust and accountability. WHEN users visit a profile page, THE platform SHALL provide a transparent view of member contributions while respecting privacy controls established by profile owners. THE system SHALL integrate profiles with authentication, content management, voting, commenting, karma calculation, community subscriptions, and moderation systems to create a cohesive user experience.

### Core Purpose of User Profiles

User profiles fulfill three essential business objectives for the platform:
1. **Community Transparency**: WHEN users view profiles, THE system SHALL display contributions and reputation to foster trust through visible participation history and karma scores.
2. **Personal Branding**: WHEN members customize their profiles, THE system SHALL allow personalization that establishes expertise and community presence.
3. **Moderation Support**: WHEN moderators review user behavior, THE system SHALL provide complete activity history to assess compliance and enforce platform rules.

THE platform SHALL implement profile features that balance transparency with user privacy to support organic community growth through verified participation tracking.

## Profile Display Requirements

### Basic Profile Information Display

WHEN any user (authenticated or guest) accesses a profile page, THE system SHALL display the following core information in a prominent header section:
- User's unique username as registered during authentication
- User's account creation date in readable format such as "Member since December 2023"
- User's total karma score calculated as net upvotes minus downvotes across all posts and comments
- User's avatar image, either user-selected or system-generated default based on username
- User's current role designation (member, moderator, or admin) with visual indicators

THE system SHALL ensure all basic profile information updates in real-time when changes occur, with karma scores reflecting voting activity within 1 second of vote submissions.

### Profile Layout Structure  

THE profile page SHALL be organized into logically separated sections for improved user experience and information hierarchy:
- Header section containing avatar, username, karma score, and join date with prominent placement
- Activity summary section displaying total post count, total comment count, and engagement metrics
- Recent activity feed showing the latest 10 user actions with timestamps
- Full activity history accessible through infinite scroll or pagination controls
- Community affiliations section listing subscribed communities with subscription dates and activity levels

THE system SHALL use responsive design that adapts profile layout for mobile and desktop viewing, ensuring all sections remain accessible on screens as small as 320 pixels wide.

### Default Profile View

WHEN a guest or authenticated user first visits any profile page, THE system SHALL display the default public view with controlled information exposure:
- Complete visibility of all basic profile information including karma and role
- Summary statistics showing total posts, total comments, and communities joined
- Most recent 10 posts and comments from the past 30 days, sorted by creation timestamp
- Up to 5 most active subscribed communities ranked by user's posting frequency

THE system SHALL load the default profile view within 2 seconds for optimal user engagement, preventing abandonment due to slow performance.

## Activity History Management  

### Activity Tracking Scope

THE system SHALL maintain comprehensive tracking of all user activities for profile display purposes:
- Original posts created, including text posts, link posts, and image posts with full content and metadata
- Comments made on posts, including nested replies with parent relationships preserved
- Votes cast on posts and comments (upvotes and downvotes) with timestamps
- Communities joined through subscription actions with subscription and last activity dates
- Karma points earned or lost from voting interactions with calculation details
- Reports submitted on inappropriate content with anonymized reporting information
- Account creation milestone and role changes with historical timestamps

WHEN recording activities, THE system SHALL capture precise UTC timestamps and maintain activity logs for at least 7 years unless legally required to delete specific information.

### Activity Visibility Rules

WHEN displaying user activity history on profiles, THE system SHALL organize content with clear temporal and categorization structure:
- Default chronological sorting showing most recent activities first
- Date range groupings such as "This Week", "This Month", "This Year", and "All Time" for easy navigation
- Timestamps displayed in user's local timezone based on their browser settings
- Clear activity type labels including "Posted in Community Name", "Commented on Post Title", "Voted up/down", and "Joined Community Name"

THE system SHALL filter activity display based on privacy settings, showing only activities the profile owner has authorized for public viewing.

### Activity History Persistence

THE system SHALL maintain activity history indefinitely for active accounts unless specific business conditions apply:
- User explicitly requests data deletion through account deactivation process
- Legal requirements necessitate data removal per court orders or data protection regulations
- Platform content policies require archiving or deletion of specific violation-related activities

WHEN users request account deactivation, THE system SHALL provide options to anonymize historical activities rather than complete deletion to maintain platform integrity.

### Recent Activity Feed

THE profile activity feed SHALL provide a dynamic overview of recent user engagement:
- Display of the most recent 50 activities in reverse chronological order with automatic refresh
- Content previews limited to first 100 characters for posts and comments with "read more" links
- Direct links to full activity content within the platform for detailed viewing
- Engagement metrics showing vote counts for posts, reply counts for comments, and karma impact

WHEN new activities occur, THE system SHALL update the feed in real-time for viewers currently on the profile page, excluding guest users.

## Public Information Rules

### Default Public Information

THE following information SHALL be publicly visible on all user profiles by default without requiring authentication:
- Username displayed prominently in profile header
