# Requirements Analysis Report for Reddit-like Community Platform

## Executive Summary

This requirements analysis report outlines the business logic, user workflows, and functional specifications for a Reddit-like community platform. The platform enables authenticated users to create and manage communities, post various types of content, engage through voting and nested comments, and participate in a karma-based reputation system. Key features include content sorting algorithms, community subscriptions, user profiles, and a moderation system for handling inappropriate content.

The platform exists to provide a collaborative online space where users can share information, discuss topics of interest, and build communities around shared passions. The system emphasizes user engagement through voting mechanics and karma tracking, while maintaining platform integrity through community-driven moderation and reporting features.

All requirements are specified in business terms, focusing on what the system should accomplish rather than how to implement it technically. This document serves as the foundation for backend development, ensuring developers understand the complete business context and user expectations.

## Business Model

### Why This Platform Exists

THE community platform SHALL provide a structured environment for users to create topic-specific communities and share content. THE system SHALL foster user engagement through voting mechanisms and reputation systems. THE platform SHALL maintain content quality through user-driven moderation and reporting capabilities.

The platform addresses the need for decentralized online discussion spaces where users can organize themselves around interests rather than relying on centralized content curation. In an era where social media algorithms often prioritize engagement over quality, this platform gives users control over their information ecosystem.

### Revenue Strategy

THE platform SHALL support advertisement display within communities. THE system SHALL offer premium features for moderators and power users. THE platform SHALL implement a subscription model for advanced community management tools. THE system SHALL enable donations and crowdfunding for community projects.

Initial revenue will focus on user growth metrics, with monetization scaling as the user base increases. Advertising will be contextual to community themes, and premium features will enhance community management capabilities.

### Growth Plan

THE system SHALL prioritize organic user growth through viral community creation. THE platform SHALL implement referral programs rewarding users for bringing new members. THE system SHALL develop mobile applications to increase accessibility. THE platform SHALL establish partnerships with educational institutions and organizations.

Growth will focus on network effects: more users in communities attract more content, which attracts more users. The platform will start with niche communities before expanding to broader topics.

### Success Metrics

THE platform SHALL track monthly active users across all communities. THE system SHALL monitor engagement through posts per user and comment interactions. THE platform SHALL measure community retention rates. THE system SHALL evaluate content quality through reporting and moderation metrics.

Success will be measured by: 100,000 monthly active users within 12 months, average of 10 posts per active user monthly, retention rate above 70% for established communities.

## Target Market and User Roles

### Primary User Types

The platform caters to three main user roles with distinct permissions and responsibilities:

#### Guest Users
Guest users can browse public content without authentication requirements. THE guest users SHALL view public posts and comments without creating an account. WHEN a guest attempts to vote or post, THE system SHALL display a registration prompt. THE guests SHALL access public community pages and read-only content.

#### Member Users
Authenticated members represent the core user base. THE members SHALL create and manage their own content including text posts, links, and images. WHEN a member votes on a post, THE system SHALL update karma scores and display changes in real-time. THE members SHALL subscribe to communities for personalized feeds. IF a member reports inappropriate content, THE system SHALL process the report for moderation review.

#### Moderator Users  
Moderator users handle community management and content oversight. THE moderators SHALL approve or remove content in their assigned communities. WHEN moderators receive reports, THE system SHALL present a moderation queue with context and timestamps. THE moderators SHALL temporarily suspend users for policy violations. THE system SHALL grant moderators elevated permissions for content management within their communities.

### Complete Authentication System

#### Registration Process
THE system SHALL allow new users to register with email and password. WHEN a user submits registration information, THE system SHALL validate email format and password strength. THE platform SHALL require email verification before account activation. IF registration fails validation, THE system SHALL display specific error messages for correction.

#### Login Flow
WHEN a user provides credentials, THE system SHALL authenticate against stored information. THE platform SHALL issue JWT access and refresh tokens upon successful login. THE access tokens SHALL expire after 15 minutes to maintain security. THE refresh tokens SHALL be valid for 7 days and allow seamless token renewal.

#### Password Management
WHEN a user requests password reset, THE system SHALL send a secure reset link to their email. THE reset link SHALL expire after 10 minutes for security. THE platform SHALL enforce password complexity requirements during changes. IF the current password is incorrect during change, THE system SHALL display an error message.

#### Role Assignment
THE system SHALL assign guest role to unregistered users. WHEN a user completes registration, THE system SHALL assign member role. THE platform SHALL provide promotion to moderator role through community election or admin selection. THE roles SHALL persist across login sessions and define user permissions.

#### Session Management
WHEN a user logs in to the system, THE session SHALL remain active unless explicitly terminated. THE platform SHALL track active sessions across devices. WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL invalidate all tokens and clear client-side storage. THE sessions SHALL automatically expire after 30 days of inactivity.
