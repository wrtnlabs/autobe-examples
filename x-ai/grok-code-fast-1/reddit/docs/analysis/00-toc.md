# Requirements Analysis Table of Contents

This document serves as the central navigation guide for the requirements analysis of the community platform project. It provides an organized overview of all documentation related to building a Reddit-like community platform with features such as user registration, community creation, posting capabilities, voting systems, commenting, karma tracking, content sorting, subscriptions, user profiles, and content moderation. WHEN users need to navigate the requirements documentation, THE table of contents SHALL provide clear, descriptive links to each requirement document.

WHEN stakeholders or developers need to find specific requirement information, THE table of contents SHALL list each document with descriptive explanations of its scope and purpose. THE table of contents SHALL contain links to all 11 requirement documents in logical order, from high-level vision through detailed implementation requirements.

## Project Documents Table of Contents

1. **[Requirements Analysis Table of Contents](./00-toc.md)**  
   Current document - Provides navigation and overview of all requirements documentation for the community platform project. WHEN users first access the requirements, THE table of contents SHALL serve as the starting point for understanding document organization and selection guide for specific requirement types.

2. **[Service Vision Document](./01-service-vision.md)**  
   Defines the overall purpose, target market, and high-level goals of the community platform, including executive summary, target audience, core problems solved, and platform objectives. WHEN stakeholders need to understand the business justification and strategic direction, THE service vision document SHALL establish the foundation for all other requirements and outline success metrics for platform growth and user engagement.

3. **[User Personas Documentation](./02-user-personas.md)**  
   Details the key user personas, their needs, behavior patterns, user journey examples, key user needs, and usage scenarios within the community platform. WHEN product managers and designers need to understand user motivations and behaviors, THE user personas documentation SHALL provide comprehensive profiles of guest, member, and moderator roles with specific behavior patterns and validation requirements for each user interaction.

4. **[Authentication Requirements Document](./03-authentication-requirements.md)**  
   Specifies the complete user authentication system including registration process, login flow, password management, role assignment, session management, and security validations. WHEN backend developers need to implement secure user access mechanisms, THE authentication requirements SHALL define complete JWT token handling, password complexity rules, and role-based permission assignments for member, moderator, and guest access levels.

5. **[Content Management Requirements](./04-content-management.md)**  
   Describes the core content creation and management features including post creation with text, links, and images, community association, content moderation integration, and edit/delete permissions. WHEN developers need to build content submission systems, THE content management requirements SHALL specify media upload validations, automated content filtering, and role-based access controls for posts, images, and community-specific content placement.

6. **[Voting and Comments System Requirements](./05-voting-comments-system.md)**  
   Specifies the voting and engagement systems including upvote/downvote mechanics, comment threading with nested replies up to unlimited levels, karma calculation algorithms based on post and comment votes, and engagement tracking metrics. WHEN implementing user interaction features, THE voting and comments requirements SHALL define real-time vote updates, karma-based reputation systems, and complete business rules for engagement tracking and content visibility algorithms.

7. **[Sorting and Subscriptions Requirements](./06-sorting-subscriptions.md)**  
   Defines post sorting algorithms for hot, new, top, and controversial content organization, community subscription mechanisms with personalized feeds, and algorithm inputs based on vote counts and time decay. WHEN building content discovery features, THE sorting and subscriptions requirements SHALL specify subscription workflow validations, personalized feed generation logic, and ranking algorithms based on user engagement and content popularity metrics.

8. **[User Profiles Requirements](./07-user-profiles.md)**  
   Specifies user profile features and public display of activity, including profile display customization, activity history showing posts and comments, privacy settings management, and profile information controls. WHEN creating user account management systems, THE user profiles requirements SHALL define public information display rules, activity visibility controls, profile customization options, and privacy validation workflows for personal data protection.

9. **[Moderation and Reporting Requirements](./08-moderation-reporting.md)**  
   Details the reporting system for inappropriate content including spam, harassment, and hate speech categories, moderation workflow from report submission through resolution, and appeals process for content restoration. WHEN implementing platform safety mechanisms, THE moderation and reporting requirements SHALL define automated content filtering, moderator queue management, report categorization rules, and resolution workflows with notification systems.

10. **[Business Logic and Validation Requirements](./09-business-logic-validation.md)**    
    Documents user interaction flows and business logic validations, including input validation rules with specific error messages, business rule definitions for all platform features, workflow validations for critical processes, error handling conditions with user feedback, and success criteria measurements. WHEN establishing system consistency, THE business logic requirements SHALL outline complete input sanitization processes, role-based access validations, and comprehensive error recovery mechanisms for reliable platform operation.

11. **[Performance and Scalability Requirements](./10-performance-scalability.md)**    
    Defines performance expectations with specific response time targets, concurrency requirements for simultaneous users, scalability metrics for growing user bases, database performance optimization guidelines, and caching strategies for efficient content delivery. WHEN architecting high-performance systems, THE performance and scalability requirements SHALL establish measurable benchmarks for load handling, user concurrency limits, and system growth capacity planning to ensure consistent user experiences under varying traffic conditions.

These documents collectively provide a comprehensive requirements analysis for building a robust community platform that includes all requested features: user registration and login, community creation, multi-format posting (text, links, images), voting systems, nested commenting, karma tracking, advanced sorting algorithms, subscription management, detailed user profiles, and content moderation through reporting.

The documentation follows a logical progression from high-level vision through detailed implementation requirements, ensuring that stakeholders at all levels can understand both the business objectives and technical specifications needed to successfully develop the platform. WHEN implementing different platform components, THE requirement documents SHALL provide independent but interconnected specifications that developers can follow without requiring cross-document navigation.

> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**. All technical implementations (architecture, APIs, database design, etc.) are at the discretion of the development team.*

*Developer Note: This document serves as an organizational index for the complete requirements package, ensuring proper document sequencing and coverage of all platform features in the requirements analysis phase.*
