# Todo List Application - Business Rules

## Introduction

This document specifies the core business rules and operational constraints governing the Todo List application's task management functionality. As a minimum viable product focused exclusively on essential CRUD operations, the Todo application requires clear business rules to ensure data integrity, user experience consistency, and secure operation. Backend developers should use these business rules as implementation guidelines, focusing on the WHAT rather than HOW of system behavior.

The business rules defined here apply universally to authenticated users performing basic task management operations: creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. All rules are expressed in EARS format for clarity and testability.

## Task Validation Rules

### Task Creation Validation
WHEN a user attempts to create a new task, THE system SHALL require a non-empty task title with a minimum length of 1 character and maximum length of 100 characters.

IF the user submits a task title that exceeds 100 characters, THEN THE system SHALL reject the creation and display a validation error message "Task title cannot exceed 100 characters".

WHILE the user is entering a task title, THE system SHALL provide real-time character count feedback showing remaining characters.

WHEN a user submits a task with an empty or whitespace-only title, THE system SHALL reject the creation with the error message "Task title is required".

### Task Description Validation
WHEN a task description is provided, THE system SHALL allow descriptions up to 500 characters in length.

IF the task description exceeds 500 characters, THEN THE system SHALL truncate the description to 500 characters and notify the user of the truncation.

WHILE a user is entering a task description, THE system SHALL provide character count feedback and prevent input beyond the 500 character limit.

### Task Status Validation
WHILE tasks are being managed, THE system SHALL maintain exactly two valid task statuses: incomplete and complete.

WHEN a task is initially created, THE system SHALL automatically set the task status to incomplete.

IF a user attempts to set a task status to any value other than incomplete or complete, THEN THE system SHALL reject the update and maintain the current status.

## Business Logic

### Task Ownership and Access Control
WHEN any task-related operation is performed, THE system SHALL verify that the requesting user is the owner of the affected task.

WHILE users can only access their own tasks, THE system SHALL prevent cross-user task access through strict ownership validation.

WHERE authentication is required, THE system SHALL enforce that all task operations are performed by authenticated users only.

WHEN a user attempts to access, update, or delete a task that does not belong to them, THE system SHALL return an authorization error and log the security violation.

### Task CRUD Operations Business Logic
WHEN a user creates a task, THE system SHALL assign a unique identifier to the task and associate it exclusively with the authenticated user.

WHILE tasks are listed, THE system SHALL sort tasks by creation date with the most recently created tasks appearing first.

WHEN a user updates a task status to complete, THE system SHALL record the completion timestamp and maintain the task in the system.

IF a user attempts to update a non-existent task, THEN THE system SHALL return a "task not found" error response.

WHEN a user deletes a task, THE system SHALL permanently remove the task from the system and confirm the deletion operation.

### Task Update Logic
WHEN a user updates a task, THE system SHALL maintain the original creation date and only modify the requested fields.

WHILE performing partial updates, THE system SHALL validate only the provided fields according to the validation rules.

IF a task update contains invalid data, THEN THE system SHALL reject the entire update and return field-specific error messages.

WHEN a task status changes from incomplete to complete, THE system SHALL automatically set the completion timestamp to the current date and time.

## Data Constraints

### Task Title Constraints
WHEN storing task titles, THE system SHALL enforce a maximum length of 100 characters including spaces and special characters.

WHILE handling task titles, THE system SHALL preserve case sensitivity as entered by the user.

WHERE task titles contain special characters, THE system SHALL accept all standard Unicode characters within the length limit.

### Task Description Constraints
WHEN storing task descriptions, THE system SHALL limit content to a maximum of 500 characters.

WHILE processing task descriptions, THE system SHALL preserve formatting including line breaks and basic text styling if supported.

IF task descriptions contain potentially harmful content, THEN THE system SHALL sanitize the input to prevent security issues.

### Task Identifier Constraints
WHEN generating task identifiers, THE system SHALL use unique, non-sequential identifiers that cannot be easily guessed.

WHILE referencing tasks in user interfaces, THE system SHALL use the task identifiers for internal operations.

WHERE task identifiers are exposed in APIs or interfaces, THE system SHALL ensure they provide no user-identifiable information.

### User Data Constraints
WHILE processing user data, THE system SHALL associate all tasks with authenticated user identities.

WHEN storing user associations, THE system SHALL use secure, non-reversible user identification methods.

IF a user account is deactivated, THEN THE system SHALL preserve existing tasks but prevent new task creation.

## Operational Boundaries

### Concurrent Access Boundaries
WHEN multiple operations are performed on the same task simultaneously, THE system SHALL use "last write wins" conflict resolution strategy.

WHILE users perform bulk operations, THE system SHALL limit concurrent task modifications to prevent data corruption.

IF conflicting updates occur, THEN THE system SHALL notify the user that their changes may have been overridden.

### Performance Boundaries
WHEN users perform typical task operations, THE system SHALL complete operations within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.

WHILE handling multiple users simultaneously, THE system SHALL maintain response times under 3 seconds for basic operations.

IF system load exceeds capacity, THEN THE system SHALL implement request queuing to maintain service availability.

### Task Volume Boundaries
WHEN users accumulate tasks, THE system SHALL support up to 1,000 active tasks per user before implementing storage limitations.

WHILE enforcing task limits, THE system SHALL provide warning notifications when users approach the 1,000 task threshold.

IF a user exceeds the 1,000 task limit, THEN THE system SHALL prevent new task creation until space is freed through deletions.

### System Availability Boundaries
WHEN the system experiences outages, THE system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime annually excluding planned maintenance.

WHILE performing maintenance activities, THE system SHALL provide at least 24 hours advance notice to users.

IF critical failures occur, THEN THE system SHALL restore full functionality within 4 hours.

### Security Boundaries
WHEN handling sensitive user data, THE system SHALL encrypt task content in transit and at rest.

WHILE authenticating users, THE system SHALL implement secure session management with automatic expiration after 30 minutes of inactivity.

IF security breaches are detected, THEN THE system SHALL immediately invalidate affected sessions and require re-authentication.

### Error Handling Boundaries
WHEN system errors occur, THE system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages without exposing technical details.

WHILE logging errors, THE system SHALL capture sufficient information for debugging while protecting sensitive data.

IF external service failures impact task operations, THEN THE system SHALL implement graceful degradation and retry mechanisms.

## Business Rule Implementation Notes

The business rules specified above form the foundation for implementing robust task management logic in the Todo List application. These rules ensure consistent user experience, data integrity, and operational reliability. Backend developers should implement validation at both the application and database levels to prevent invalid data states.

All business rules are designed to be testable and measurable, allowing for automated validation during development and quality assurance processes. The rules focus on user-facing behaviors and data constraints, leaving technical implementation details to the development team's discretion.
