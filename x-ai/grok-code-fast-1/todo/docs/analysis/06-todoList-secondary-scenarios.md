# TodoList Secondary User Scenarios

## Introduction

This document describes the secondary user scenarios for the TodoList application, focusing on alternative paths and less common use cases in task management. These scenarios complement the [Primary User Scenarios Document](./05-todoList-primary-user-scenarios.md) by covering bulk operations, filtering, searching, and archiving functionality that provide enhanced user experience for managing multiple or specific tasks efficiently.

The TodoList application serves as a simple task management tool where authenticated users can perform full CRUD operations on their own todo items. Secondary scenarios assume users are logged in and have existing tasks in their system.

## Bulk Operations

Bulk operations allow users to perform actions on multiple tasks simultaneously to improve efficiency when managing groups of items.

### Bulk Task Completion

WHEN a user selects multiple incomplete tasks and chooses to mark them as complete, THE system SHALL update all selected tasks to completed status in a single operation.

WHEN a user attempts to mark already completed tasks as complete in bulk, THE system SHALL skip those tasks and only update eligible incomplete tasks.

WHILE processing bulk completion, THE system SHALL maintain data integrity and prevent partial updates.

IF during bulk completion an error occurs for any task (such as concurrency issues), THEN THE system SHALL provide a clear message indicating exactly which tasks were not updated and why.

### Bulk Task Deletion

WHEN a user selects multiple tasks and chooses bulk deletion, THE system SHALL present a confirmation dialog requiring explicit user acknowledgment before proceeding.

WHEN the user confirms bulk deletion, THE system SHALL permanently remove all selected tasks from the user's account.

WHILE performing bulk deletion, THE system SHALL validate that all selected tasks belong to the current user and prevent unauthorized deletions.

IF bulk deletion includes tasks with special status (such as archived tasks), THEN THE system SHALL notify the user of this circumstance and require additional confirmation.

## Task Filtering

Task filtering enables users to view subsets of their tasks based on various criteria, making it easier to focus on specific work items.

### Filter by Completion Status

WHEN a user applies a filter to show only completed tasks, THE system SHALL display a list containing only tasks marked as completed.

WHEN a user applies a filter to show only incomplete tasks, THE system SHALL display a list containing only tasks that have not been completed.

WHEN a user clears all filters, THE system SHALL return to displaying all tasks regardless of completion status.

WHILE filters are active, THE system SHALL update the display in real-time if task statuses change due to user actions or other processes.

### Filter by Date Range

WHEN a user filters tasks by creation date range, THE system SHALL display only tasks created within the specified date range.

WHEN a user filters tasks by due date range, THE system SHALL display only tasks with due dates falling within the specified range.

WHERE due dates are optional, THE system SHALL handle tasks without due dates appropriately in date-based filters (typically excluding them from date-specific views).

WHILE applying date filters, THE system SHALL interpret date ranges inclusively and handle timezone considerations based on user settings.

### Filter by Priority Level

WHEN a user filters by priority level (such as high, medium, low), THE system SHALL display only tasks matching the selected priority levels.

WHEN no priority is assigned to a task, THE system SHALL treat it as a default priority level for filtering purposes.

WHILE priority filters are active, THE system SHALL maintain filter state across page reloads where appropriate.

## Task Search

Task search allows users to quickly find specific tasks based on content rather than predefined categories.

### Text-based Search

WHEN a user enters search terms, THE system SHALL search through task titles and descriptions for matching text.

WHEN a user searches with multiple words, THE system SHALL find tasks that contain all search terms or use advanced search operators if implemented.

WHILE searching, THE system SHALL highlight matching text in search results to help users identify relevant content.

IF no tasks match the search criteria, THEN THE system SHALL display an appropriate message and suggest alternative search terms or clearing filters.

### Advanced Search Options

WHERE available, THE system SHALL support search within specific fields such as titles only or descriptions only.

WHEN advanced search is used, THE system SHALL allow combination with existing filters to narrow results further.

WHILE processing searches, THE system SHALL handle special characters and perform case-insensitive matching.

### Search Result Management

WHEN search results are displayed, THE system SHALL preserve the search context for actions performed on found tasks.

WHEN users perform actions on search results (like marking complete), THE system SHALL update the original tasks and refresh search results accordingly.

WHILE search results are active, THE system SHALL indicate that a filtered view is being displayed and provide easy access to return to full task list.

## Task Archiving

Task archiving provides a way to keep completed or old tasks accessible without cluttering the main task list.

### Manual Task Archiving

WHEN a user chooses to archive a completed task, THE system SHALL move it to a separate archived section and remove it from the main task list.

WHEN a user archives a task, THE system SHALL retain all task details including completion status and timestamps.

WHILE archiving tasks, THE system SHALL confirm the action to prevent accidental archiving of important items.

### Archival Retrieval

WHEN a user wants to view archived tasks, THE system SHALL display them in a dedicated archived tasks view.

WHEN a user retrieves an archived task, THE system SHALL provide options to restore it to the main list or delete it permanently.

WHILE in archived view, THE system SHALL maintain the same search and filtering capabilities as the main task list.

### Automatic Archiving

WHERE configured, THE system SHALL automatically archive tasks that have been completed for more than a specified period (such as 30 days).

WHEN automatic archiving occurs, THE system SHALL notify the user of the action and provide access to undo it within a grace period.

WHILE performing automatic archiving, THE system SHALL exclude tasks marked as important or pinned from automatic processing.

## Integration with Primary Scenarios

Secondary scenarios integrate seamlessly with the core task management functionality described in the [Primary User Scenarios Document](./05-todoList-primary-user-scenarios.md).

All secondary scenarios SHALL maintain the user roles and permissions defined in the [User Roles Document](./04-todoList-user-roles.md), ensuring that authenticated users can only perform bulk operations, filtering, searching, and archiving on their own tasks.

Business rules from the [Business Rules Document](./10-todoList-business-rules.md) SHALL apply to all secondary scenarios, including data validation and operational boundaries.

WHEN errors occur in secondary scenarios, THE system SHALL follow the exception handling patterns outlined in the [Exception Handling Document](./07-todoList-exception-handling.md).

Each secondary scenario SHALL meet the performance expectations defined in the [Performance Expectations Document](./08-todoList-performance-expectations.md), providing responsive user experience even for operations involving multiple tasks.

## Security Considerations

All secondary scenarios SHALL adhere to the security requirements in the [Security Compliance Document](./09-todoList-security-compliance.md), ensuring that bulk operations, filtering, and searching do not expose data from other users or compromise system integrity.

WHEN performing bulk operations, THE system SHALL verify user authorization for each affected task before proceeding.

WHILE processing search requests, THE system SHALL prevent injection attacks and limit search scope to the authenticated user only.

## Future Extensions

The secondary scenarios provide a foundation for future enhancements such as:

- Advanced filtering with custom criteria
- Collaboration features for shared tasks
- Task templates and recurring tasks
- Integration with calendar applications
- Mobile and desktop application versions

These scenarios focus on enhancing productivity while maintaining the simple, straightforward nature of the TodoList application.
