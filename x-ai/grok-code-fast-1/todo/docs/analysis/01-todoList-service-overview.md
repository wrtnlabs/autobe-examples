# Todo List Application - Business Rules

## Task Validation Rules

### Task Creation Validation
WHEN a user attempts to create a new task, THE system SHALL validate that the task title is provided and not empty.

WHEN a user submits a task title exceeding 100 characters during creation, THE system SHALL reject the creation and display a validation error.

WHEN a user attempts to create a task without being authenticated, THE system SHALL deny the request and redirect to login.

IF a task description is provided during creation but exceeds 500 characters, THEN THE system SHALL prevent creation and notify the user of the limit.

WHENEVER a task creation includes special characters in the title, THE system SHALL allow them as valid input without restriction.

WHERE task creation occurs, THE system SHALL automatically assign creation timestamp and associate the task with the authenticated user's ID.

### Task Title Requirements
WHEN a task title contains only whitespace characters, THE system SHALL treat it as invalid and require a meaningful title.

IF a task title contains inappropriate content as determined by basic filters, THEN THE system SHALL reject the creation with an appropriate message.

WHENEVER task titles are validated, THE system SHALL trim leading and trailing whitespace before storage.

WHERE title validation occurs, THE system SHALL ensure titles are case-insensitive for uniqueness within a user's tasks.

### Task Description Validation
WHEN a task description is provided, THE system SHALL validate it does not exceed the 500 character limit.

IF a task description contains potentially harmful content, THEN THE system SHALL sanitize the content before storage.

WHENEVER descriptions are processed, THE system SHALL allow common formatting like line breaks and URLs.

WHERE description fields are empty, THE system SHALL store them as null or empty string consistently across the system.

## Business Logic

### Task Ownership and Access Control
WHEN a user attempts to perform any operation on a task, THE system SHALL verify the user is authenticated with valid session.

WHEN a task operation is requested, THE system SHALL confirm the authenticated user is the owner of the specific task.

IF an authenticated user tries to access tasks owned by another user, THEN THE system SHALL return access denied error.

WHENEVER task ownership is established during creation, THE system SHALL associate the task with the user's unique identifier.

WHERE bulk operations are performed, THE system SHALL validate ownership for all affected tasks before proceeding.

### Task Creation Workflow
WHEN an authenticated user initiates task creation, THE system SHALL present a form with title field as required.

WHEN the user submits a valid task creation request, THE system SHALL generate a unique task identifier.

WHENEVER a task is successfully created, THE system SHALL store it in the user's personal task collection.

WHERE task creation includes optional fields, THE system SHALL set default values for unspecified fields like status as "incomplete".

IF task creation fails due to system constraints, THEN THE system SHALL rollback any partial changes and notify the user.

### Task Listing Logic
WHEN a user requests to list their tasks, THE system SHALL retrieve only tasks owned by that authenticated user.

WHEN displaying task lists, THE system SHALL sort tasks by creation date with newest tasks first by default.

IF a user has no tasks, THEN THE system SHALL display an empty state message encouraging task creation.

WHENEVER task lists are retrieved, THE system SHALL include complete task information including status and timestamps.

WHERE pagination is needed for large task lists, THE system SHALL support retrieving tasks in batches.

### Task Status Update Logic
WHEN a user marks a task as complete, THE system SHALL update the task status and set completion timestamp.

WHEN a task is marked incomplete after being complete, THE system SHALL clear the completion timestamp.

IF a task status update is requested for a non-existent task, THEN THE system SHALL return an error without affecting other tasks.

WHENEVER status updates occur, THE system SHALL ensure atomic changes to prevent data inconsistencies.

WHERE status changes happen in bulk, THE system SHALL validate each task exists and belongs to the user.

### Task Deletion Logic
WHEN a user initiates task deletion, THE system SHALL require confirmation before proceeding with permanent removal.

WHEN deletion is confirmed, THE system SHALL permanently remove the task from the user's collection and all related data.

IF deletion is attempted on a task that does not exist or belongs to another user, THEN THE system SHALL deny the request.

WHENEVER tasks are deleted, THE system SHALL not leave orphaned references in search indexes or lists.

WHERE bulk deletion occurs, THE system SHALL ensure all selected tasks belong to the user and process them atomically.

### Task Search and Filtering Logic
WHEN users search for tasks, THE system SHALL search within titles and descriptions of their own tasks only.

WHEN filters are applied, THE system SHALL allow filtering by completion status (complete/incomplete).

IF search terms match multiple tasks, THEN THE system SHALL rank results by relevance to search terms.

WHENEVER search requests are processed, THE system SHALL respect case-insensitive matching.

WHERE no search results are found, THE system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternative searches.

## Data Constraints

### Task Field Limits
WHEN storing task data, THE system SHALL enforce a maximum title length of 100 characters.

WHEN processing descriptions, THE system SHALL limit them to 500 characters maximum.

WHENEVER timestamps are generated, THE system SHALL use ISO 8601 format for consistency.

WHERE unique identifiers are created, THE system SHALL use UUID format for task IDs.

IF additional metadata fields are added in future, THEN THE system SHALL validate them against predefined constraints.

### Data Type Constraints
WHEN task data is stored or retrieved, THE system SHALL maintain correct data types for all fields.

WHEN boolean values like completion status are used, THE system SHALL store them as true/false consistently.

IF date fields are processed, THEN THE system SHALL validate ISO 8601 format and timezone handling.

WHENEVER numeric values are used, THE system SHALL validate they are within reasonable ranges.

WHERE text fields are processed, THE system SHALL encode them in UTF-8 for international character support.

### Storage Constraints
WHEN a user's task storage approaches limits, THE system SHALL warn the user before enforcing hard limits.

WHEN the maximum tasks per user is reached (1,000 tasks), THE system SHALL prevent new task creation until cleanup occurs.

IF temporary storage is used, THEN THE system SHALL clean up temporary data within 24 hours.

WHENEVER data is archived, THE system SHALL maintain complete task record integrity.

WHERE backup storage occurs, THE system SHALL encrypt archived data for security.

## Operational Boundaries

### Performance Limits
WHEN users perform operations, THE system SHALL complete standard operations within 2 seconds under normal load.

WHEN bulk operations affect up to 50 tasks, THE system SHALL process them within 5 seconds.

IF system load exceeds thresholds, THEN THE system SHALL prioritize task CRUD operations over background processes.

WHENEVER response times degrade, THE system SHALL provide user feedback about delays.

WHERE performance monitoring indicates issues, THE system SHALL auto-scale resources appropriately.

### Rate Limiting
WHEN API calls exceed reasonable limits, THE system SHALL implement rate limiting per user.

WHEN login attempts are too frequent, THE system SHALL temporarily lock accounts after failed attempts.

IF automation is detected, THEN THE system SHALL challenge users with additional verification.

WHENEVER rate limits are approached, THE system SHALL inform users of their usage status.

WHERE legitimate overuse occurs, THE system SHALL provide upgrade paths or increased limits.

### Session Management
WHEN user sessions remain inactive, THE system SHALL automatically expire them after 7 days.

WHEN security concerns arise, THE system SHALL revoke all active sessions for affected users.

IF session tokens are compromised, THEN THE system SHALL invalidate them immediately upon detection.

WHENEVER sessions expire, THE system SHALL redirect users to re-authentication without data loss.

WHERE concurrent sessions exist, THE system SHALL track and manage them appropriately.

### Business Quotas
WHEN users reach operational limits, THE system SHALL prevent further actions with clear messaging.

WHEN business goals change, THE system SHALL adjust quotas through configuration updates.

IF premium features become available, THEN THE system SHALL differentiate quotas by user tier.

WHENEVER quotas are enforced, THE system SHALL provide clear paths to resolve limitations.

WHERE data retention policies apply, THE system SHALL archive old data automatically.

### Security Boundaries
WHEN external access attempts occur, THE system SHALL log and monitor suspicious activity.

WHEN data breaches are detected, THE system SHALL contain them rapidly and notify affected users.

IF compliance requirements change, THEN THE system SHALL update security measures accordingly.

WHENEVER security incidents occur, THE system SHALL conduct post-mortems and implement improvements.

WHERE third-party integrations exist, THE system SHALL maintain secure boundaries and access controls.

### Scalability Boundaries
WHEN user base grows, THE system SHALL support up to 100,000 concurrent users with maintained performance.

WHEN data volumes increase, THE system SHALL scale storage and processing capacity dynamically.

IF geographic expansion occurs, THEN THE system SHALL handle international data residency requirements.

WHENEVER scaling events happen, THE system SHALL maintain operational continuity.

WHERE capacity planning indicates limits, THE system SHALL provide early warning systems.

### Maintenance Boundaries
WHEN scheduled maintenance occurs, THE system SHALL minimize downtime to under 4 hours monthly.

WHEN emergency maintenance is required, THE system SHALL communicate expected impact in advance.

IF changes affect functionality, THEN THE system SHALL version APIs and provide migration guidance.

WHENEVER maintenance is planned, THE system SHALL back up all data and test recovery procedures.

WHERE developmental changes occur, THE system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible.

### Cost Management Boundaries
WHEN operational costs exceed thresholds, THE system SHALL optimize resource usage.

WHEN feature requests increase complexity, THE system SHALL evaluate business value against maintenance costs.

IF cloud costs rise, THEN THE system SHALL implement usage monitoring and cost controls.

WHENEVER cost optimizations occur, THE system SHALL maintain performance and security standards.

Where return on investment decreases, THE system SHALL prioritize feature deprecation or removal.
