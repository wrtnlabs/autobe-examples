The user wants a Todo list application with minimum functionality: adding tasks, listing tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks. Since the user is not familiar with programming, this requirements analysis should focus on business requirements and rules.

User roles defined: 
- User: Authenticated users who can create, view, update, and delete their own todo tasks with full CRUD operations.

Service prefix: todoList

Related context: This is document 10-todoList-business-rules.md in a series of documents for the project. It should follow the outline provided: Task Validation Rules, Business Logic, Data Constraints, Operational Boundaries.

Minimum functionality means focusing only on essential todo operations without advanced features.

# Todo List Business Rules and Operational Constraints

This document specifies the core business rules and operational constraints that govern the Todo List application's functionality. As a minimal task management system, these rules ensure consistent, predictable behavior across all operations while maintaining user data privacy and security. The requirements are expressed in business terms to guide backend developers in implementing appropriate logic without specifying technical solutions.

## Task Validation Rules

Task validation ensures that only valid, meaningful task data enters the system while preventing inappropriate or harmful content.

WHEN a user creates a new todo task, THE system SHALL validate that the task title is provided and contains meaningful text (not empty or consisting only of spaces).

THE system SHALL enforce a maximum task title length of 100 characters to ensure readability and prevent excessive data storage.

IF a task title exceeds 100 characters, THEN THE system SHALL reject the task creation and display an appropriate error message guiding the user to shorten the title.

WHEN a user provides an optional task description, THE system SHALL allow descriptions up to 500 characters maximum.

THE system SHALL validate that task descriptions contain only text content without executable code or malicious content, though this basic validation focuses on length constraints.

WHEN a user attempts to update an existing task, THE system SHALL apply the same validation rules to prevent invalid updates.

THE system SHALL require that all task updates maintain the same ownership rules - users can only update their own tasks.

IF a task update would violate business rules (such as changing ownership), THEN THE system SHALL reject the update and maintain the original task data.

## Business Logic

The business logic defines how tasks move through their lifecycle and how users interact with the system in meaningful ways.

WHEN a user creates a new task, THE system SHALL automatically set the task status to "incomplete" and record the creation timestamp for business tracking purposes.

THE system SHALL sort all task lists by creation date with newest tasks appearing first to provide users with chronological context.

WHEN a user marks a task as complete, THE system SHALL update both the completion status and record a completion timestamp for business analytics.

THE system SHALL preserve completed tasks in user lists for historical reference, allowing users to review their accomplishment history.

WHEN a user chooses to delete a task, THE system SHALL permanently remove the task from active lists while maintaining business audit trails where required.

THE system SHALL prevent task creation by unauthenticated users to maintain data isolation between different user accounts.

WHEN users access their task lists, THE system SHALL implement data isolation ensuring users see only their own tasks and never view another user's data.

THE system SHALL track task ownership at creation time and maintain this association through all subsequent operations.

IF business rules conflict with user actions (such as attempting to access non-owned tasks), THEN THE system SHALL enforce the business rule and provide appropriate user feedback.

## Data Constraints

Data constraints define the boundaries and limitations that govern how task information is stored and managed within the business context.

THE system SHALL limit each user to a maximum of 1,000 active tasks to prevent system abuse and maintain performance expectations.

WHEN users approach their task limit, THE system SHALL display warnings encouraging task completion or deletion rather than blocking functionality immediately.

THE system SHALL enforce task data field constraints:
- Task titles: required, string, maximum 100 characters
- Task descriptions: optional, string, maximum 500 characters
- Task status: required, enum (incomplete, complete)
- Creation timestamp: automatically set, not user-editable
- Completion timestamp: automatically set when status changes to complete

THE system SHALL validate that task data conforms to expected formats without specifying technical implementation details.

WHEN storing task data, THE system SHALL ensure data persistence with appropriate backup and recovery capabilities built into the business operations.

## Operational Boundaries

Operational boundaries set the limits for system behavior and define what constitutes acceptable use within the business context.

THE system SHALL function as a personal task management tool where users maintain exclusive control over their task data.

THE system SHALL prohibit cross-user task operations where one authenticated user cannot view, modify, or delete another user's tasks.

WHEN bulk operations are attempted across multiple tasks, THE system SHALL validate that all affected tasks belong to the requesting user before proceeding.

THE system SHALL maintain business rules that prevent system abuse, such as creating excessively large tasks or rapid creation of meaningless tasks.

THE system SHALL enforce session-based operation boundaries where task operations require authenticated sessions with appropriate timeout periods.

WHEN operational limits are approached (task count limits, processing thresholds), THE system SHALL provide user feedback promoting cleanup and efficient task management.

THE system SHALL support a minimum operational scenario where users can perform full CRUD operations on their tasks during normal business hours with expected performance levels.
