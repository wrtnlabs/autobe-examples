Business Model and Objectives\n\n### Why This Service Exists\nThe e-commerce shopping mall platform serves as a comprehensive digital marketplace where buyers can discover and purchase products, sellers can list and manage their inventory, and administrators can oversee platform operations. The business addresses the growing need for convenient, secure online shopping by providing a centralized platform that connects multiple sellers with consumers, enabling transactions with real-time tracking and reviews.\n\n### Business Strategy\nThe platform operates on a marketplace revenue model, generating income through transaction fees on sales, subscription fees for premium seller accounts, or advertising. User acquisition relies on digital marketing, search engine optimization, and partnerships with sellers. Growth strategies include expanding product categories, international expansion, and mobile app development to increase user engagement and transaction volumes.\n\n### Core Value Proposition\nWHEN a user accesses the platform, THE system SHALL provide a seamless shopping experience that connects verified sellers with authenticated buyers. WHILE buyers browse the catalog, THE system SHALL enable personalized recommendations and real-time inventory availability. WHERE sellers manage products, THE system SHALL offer tools for efficient inventory tracking and sales analytics.\n\n### Success Metrics\nTo measure success, the platform tracks monthly active users (target: 10,000+ MAU), average order value (target: $50+), seller retention rate (target: 80%+ after first year), and customer satisfaction scores (target: 4.5/5 stars). Year-over-year revenue growth of 50%+ indicates healthy business scaling.\n\n## 2. User Roles and Authentication\n\n### Role Definitions\nThe platform supports three primary user roles:\n\n- **Buyer**: Authenticated users who shop, maintain shopping carts and wishlists, place orders, track shipments, leave product reviews, and manage account information including addresses.\n- **Seller**: Authenticated users who list products with variants, manage inventory per SKU, set pricing, process sales, and view analytics on their product performance.\n- **Admin**: System administrators with elevated access to oversee all orders, approve seller accounts, manage platform-wide product listings, and handle user support cases.\n\n### Authentication Requirements\nTHE platform SHALL implement JWT-based authentication for all user sessions.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to register, THE system SHALL validate email format and password strength (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character).\n\nWHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL authenticate credentials against stored hashes and respond within 2 seconds.\n\nWHILE a user session is active, THE system SHALL include user ID, role, and permissions in JWT payload.\n\nIF authentication fails due to invalid credentials, THEN THE system SHALL return appropriate error messages and limit retry attempts to prevent brute force attacks.\n\nTHE system SHALL support password reset via email verification tokens expiring in 30 minutes.\n\nWHEN a user completes registration, THE system SHALL send email verification before enabling full account access.\n\n### Permission Matrix\n\n| Feature | Buyer | Seller | Admin |\n|---------|-------|--------|-------|\n| Browse products | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Search products | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Add to cart/wishlist | Yes | No | No |\n| Place orders | Yes | No | No |\n| Track orders | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Leave reviews | Yes | No | No |\n| Manage own products | No | Yes | No |\n| View sales analytics | No | Yes | Yes |\n| Manage inventory | No | Yes | No |\n| Moderate content | No | No | Yes |\n| Approve sellers | No | No | Yes |\n| System administration | No | No | Yes |\n\n## 3. Functional Requirements\n\n### 3.1 User Management\nWHEN a new user registers for an account, THE system SHALL collect email, password, and basic profile information initially. THE system SHALL verify email through a confirmation link sent within seconds of registration. WHILE registering, THE system SHALL validate email format and check for duplicate addresses.\n\nFor address management (buyers only), WHEN a buyer adds an address, THE system SHALL support multiple addresses per account with fields for street address, city, state/province, postal code, and country. IF an address format is invalid, THEN THE system SHALL highlight the field and provide guidance (e.g., \"Postal code required for this country\").\n\nLogin requirements: WHEN a user submits credentials, THE system SHALL authenticate and respond within 3 seconds under normal load. IF login fails due to incorrect credentials, THEN THE system SHALL increment a failed attempt counter and lock accounts after 5 consecutive failures for 30 minutes.\n\n### 3.2 Product Management\nTHE system SHALL organize products into hierarchical categories (e.g., Electronics > Smartphones > Android). WHEN a seller lists a product, THE system SHALL require basic information: name, description, base price, and category assignment. Product variants use SKU system: WHILE creating variants, THE system SHALL allow selection of attributes like color (\"Red\", \"Blue\"), size (\"S\", \"M\", \"L\"), and material options (\"Cotton\", \"Linen\").\n\nInventory management per SKU: WHEN sellers update inventory, THE system SHALL track quantity available, reserved (in carts), and sold amounts. IF inventory doesn't meet demand, THEN THE system SHALL prevent order completion and notify sellers via dashboard alerts.\n\nSearch functionality: WHEN users search products, THE system SHALL support keyword searches across product names, descriptions, and category names. Results SHALL display within 1 second for queries with results, using relevance ranking (exact matches first, then partial matches).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Seller Creates Product\"] --> B[\"Add Basic Info\"]\n  B --> C[\"Select Category\"]\n  C --> D[\"Add Variants/SKU\"]\n  D --> E[\"Set Initial Inventory\"]\n  E --> F[\"Publish Product\"]\n  F --> G{\"Validation Checks Pass?\"}\n  G -->|\"\"No\"\"| H[\"Show Errors\"]\n  G -->|\"\"Yes\"\"| I[\"Product Live\"]\n```\n\n### 3.3 Shopping and Order Processing\nShopping cart: WHEN a buyer adds items to cart, THE system SHALL maintain cart contents across sessions until checkout. IF adding an out-of-stock item, THEN THE system SHALL notify the buyer and suggest alternatives.\n\nWishlist: THE system SHALL allow buyers to save products for future consideration, with notifications when wishlist items go on sale or restock.\n\nOrder placement: WHEN a buyer initiates checkout, THE system SHALL verify cart contents against current inventory. IF inventory is insufficient, THEN THE system SHALL remove unavailable items and notify the buyer. The system SHALL collect payment information and shipping address before order confirmation.\n\nPayment processing: WHILE processing payments, THE system SHALL integrate with external payment gateways to handle various methods (credit card, debit card, digital wallets). IF payment fails, THEN THE system SHALL return to cart with error details and allow retry attempts.\n\nOrder tracking: WHEN an order ships, THE system SHALL update status with tracking numbers from shipping providers. Buyers can view order history with status updates: \"Processing\", \"Shipped\", \"Delivered\", \"Cancelled\", \"Refunded\". WHEN status changes, THE system SHALL send email notifications to buyers and sellers.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Buyer Initiates Checkout\"] --> B[\"Validate Cart Items\"]\n  B --> C[\"Collect Shipping Info\"]\n  C --> D[\"Process Payment\"]\n  D --> E{\"Payment Success?\"}\n  E -->|\"\"No\"\"| F[\"Show Payment Error\"]\n  E -->|\"\"Yes\"\"| G[\"Create Order\"]\n  G --> H[\"Send Confirmations\"]\n  H --> I[\"Order Processing Begins\"]\n```\n\n### 3.4 Reviews and Feedback\nProduct reviews: WHEN a buyer completes an order, THE system SHALL enable rating products on a 1-5 star scale with optional text feedback. REVIEWS SHALL appear on product pages after purchase verification. IF reviewers provide inappropriate content, THEN THE system SHALL allow sellers to report for admin review (admins can hide/remove problematic reviews).\n\nReview moderation: WHILE reviews are moderated, THE system SHALL use keyword filtering for spam (e.g., repeated links, offensive terms) and require admin approval for first-time reviewers. Buyers can upload up to 3 photos per review showing product usage.\n\n### 3.5 Seller Management\nSeller accounts: WHEN applying for seller status, THE system SHALL require additional verification like business information and tax identification. IF approved by admin, THEN THE system SHALL grant seller permissions and send welcome notifications.\n\nProduct management tools: WHILE sellers manage products, THE system SHALL provide bulk upload capabilities for inventory updates and price changes. Sellers can view analytics: sales volume, top products, customer demographics, and revenue trends.\n\nSeller dashboard: THE system SHALL offer customized views showing active listings, pending orders, inventory alerts, and performance metrics.\n\n### 3.6 Administrative Functions\nAdmin dashboard: WHEN admins log in, THE system SHALL display system-wide metrics: total orders, pending seller approvals, reported reviews, and platform performance.\n\nOrder management: Admins can view all orders, modify statuses, and intervene in disputes. For product management, admins oversee all listings and can feature products or remove violations.\n\nUser support: WHILE handling support cases, THE system SHALL log admin actions for transparency and allow communication with buyers/sellers through in-platform messaging.\n\n## 4. Business Rules and Validation\n\n### Data Validation Rules\n- Email addresses: WHEN entered, THE system SHALL validate format using standard patterns (user@domain.com) and reject domains commonly associated with spam.\n- Passwords: THE system SHALL enforce minimum complexity (8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character).\n- Product prices: IF prices are less than $1, THEN THE system SHALL require seller justification and approval.\n- Inventory quantities: Negative values are prohibited; system treats negative values as zero stock and notifies sellers.\n\n### Order Processing Rules\n- Minimum order value: $10 to qualify for free shipping.\n- Maximum items per order: 50 items to prevent bulk purchasing abuse.\n- Return windows: Buyers have 30 days for returns; refunds processed within 5-7 business days after return receipt.\n\n### Seller Verification\n- New sellers require admin approval before listing first products.\n- Sellers must maintain active listings (minimum 5 products) to keep account status.\n- Suspicious activity (multiple reported reviews, pattern of cancelled orders) triggers account review.\n\n### Inventory Rules\n- SKU allocation: Unique SKUs per variant combination across the platform.\n- Stock reservation: Items in carts reserve inventory for 30 minutes before release.\n- Low stock alerts: WHEN inventory drops below 20% of initial stock, THE system SHALL notify sellers.\n\n## 5. Error Handling and Recovery\n\n### Registration Errors\nIF email verification fails, THEN THE system SHALL provide a \"Resend Verification Email\" option with rate limiting (maximum 3 resends per hour).\n\n### Payment Failures\nWHEN payment processing encounters errors, THE system SHALL categorize errors (insufficient funds, card expired, etc.) and provide specific recovery guidance. Users can save multiple payment methods for faster retries.\n\n### Inventory Issues\nWHEN buyers attempt to purchase out-of-stock items, THE system SHALL remove them from cart with notification of alternatives. Sellers receive automatic alerts when inventory goes negative due to order completion race conditions.\n\n### Shipping Errors\nIF tracking information becomes unavailable, THEN THE system SHALL notify buyers with alternative contact methods for shipping carriers. Automatic fallback to order status \"Delivered\" occurs after estimated delivery date + 3 days.\n\n### Account Recovery\nWHEN users request password resets, THE system SHALL send secure tokens via email and require validation within 15 minutes. Expired tokens trigger new requests without limits.\n\n### General Error Recovery\nFOR all user-facing errors, THE system SHALL maintain session state and provide clear paths back to intended actions. Error messages use plain language explaining issues and next steps.\n\n## 6. Performance and Usability Expectations\n\n### Response Times\nSEARCH results SHALL return within 1 second for basic queries and 3 seconds for complex filtered searches. PAGE loads SHALL feel instantaneous (under 2 seconds) for catalog browsing. ORDER processing SHALL complete within 10 seconds under normal load to maintain user trust.\n\n### Scalability\nTHE system SHALL support 1,000 concurrent users during peak hours without performance degradation. WHILE handling traffic spikes (up to 10,000 simultaneous users), THE system SHALL maintain core functionality with graceful degradation of non-essential features.\n\n### User Experience\nTHE system SHALL provide consistent interface behavior across devices (desktop, mobile). WHEN users interact with forms, THE system SHALL auto-save progress for complex operations like product listing.

It focuses on protecting user data, ensuring secure authentication, and meeting regulatory standards. The requirements are written in natural language to guide business logic implementation, without specifying technical architecture or implementation details. All authentication must align with the defined user roles (buyer, seller, admin) as outlined in the [User Roles Documentation](./02-user-roles.md).\n\n## Business Context\nThe shopping platform operates as an e-commerce marketplace where buyers can purchase products, sellers can list items for sale, and administrators manage the system. Security and compliance are critical because the platform handles sensitive information including user credentials, payment data, personal addresses, and financial transactions. Any security breach could result in data loss, financial harm to users, regulatory fines, and loss of trust in the platform.\n\n## Authentication Security\n\n### Core Authentication Requirements\nTHE system SHALL require all users to authenticate before accessing any personal account features.  \nWHEN a user attempts to access buyer functions such as viewing order history or managing shipping addresses, THE system SHALL verify the user is logged in as a buyer role.  \nWHEN a user attempts to access seller features such as updating inventory or viewing sales reports, THE system SHALL verify the user is logged in as a seller role.  \nWHEN a user attempts to access admin functions such as managing all orders or resolving disputes, THE system SHALL verify the user is logged in as an admin role.  \n\n### Session Management\nTHE system SHALL maintain secure user sessions throughout the shopping experience.  \nWHEN a user logs in successfully, THE system SHALL create a session that expires after a reasonable period of user inactivity.  \nWHEN a user's session expires, THE system SHALL require the user to log in again to continue accessing account-protected features.  \nWHEN a

experience:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"User Flow Integration\"\n        A[\"Registration\"] --> B[\"Product Browsing\"]\n        B --> C[\"Cart Management\"]\n        C --> D[\"Payment Processing\"]\n        D --> E[\"Order Tracking\"]\n        E --> F[\"Review Submission\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"Seller Operations\"\n        G[\"Seller Registration\"] --> H[\"Product

inventory management and admin oversight functions. For example, when a seller updates inventory (I), it immediately affects product availability in buyer browsing (B). Admin reviews of seller listings (L) ensure products meet platform standards before appearing in buyer searches.\n\n## Business Processes and Workflows\n\n### Purchase Process Workflow\n\nWHEN a buyer completes registration and authentication, THE buyer SHALL browse the product catalog using search and filtering capabilities. WHEN products are added to cart with valid variant selections, THE system SHALL check inventory availability and reserve items temporarily. WHEN checkout is initiated, THE system SHALL calculate totals, validate payment information, and process the transaction. WHEN payment succeeds, THE system SHALL create orders, notify sellers, and provide tracking capabilities to buyers.\n\n### Seller Onboarding Workflow\n\nWHEN a business registers as a seller, THE system SHALL collect verification documents and business information. WHEN verification is complete, THE system SHALL activate seller accounts with dashboard access. WHEN sellers create products with variants and SKUs, THE system SHALL validate uniqueness and publish to the catalog. WHEN orders arrive, THE system SHALL notify sellers and provide fulfillment tools.\n\n### Admin Moderation Workflow\n\nWHEN admins access the dashboard, THE system SHALL display pending tasks including new seller verifications and flagged content. WHEN reviewing seller applications, THE system SHALL provide tools for approval or rejection with detailed feedback. WHEN monitoring product listings, THE system SHALL enable bulk actions for compliance enforcement.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nThe platform SHALL be considered successful when:\n- 95% of registered users complete at least one purchase within 30 days\n- Average order processing time is under 5 minutes during peak hours\n- 99% order accuracy with no inventory discrepancies reported\n- Customer satisfaction rating above 4.5 out of 5 stars on post-purchase surveys\n- Seller onboarding time reduced to under 2 business days after document submission\n- System handles 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation exceed 10% slowdown\n- Average session duration exceeds 5 minutes during first month of platform operation\n- Mobile user conversion rate matches desktop performance within 15% variance\n\n## Assumptions and Dependencies\n\nThis document assumes:\n- Third-party payment gateways support secure API integrations as detailed in the [External Integrations Documentation](./07-external-integrations.md)\n- Shipping providers offer real-time tracking APIs with webhook notifications\n- Email notification services maintain 99.9% delivery success rate\n- Database systems support the transaction volumes described in [Performance Expectations](./08-performance-expectations.md)\n- Legal compliance requirements are met as specified in [Security Compliance Documentation](./09-security-compliance.md)\n- User roles and authentication patterns follow the system defined in [User Roles Documentation](./02-user-roles.md)\n\n## Data Validation and Error Handling Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Invalid Product Search\nWHEN a buyer enters an invalid search term containing special characters not supported in the search algorithm, THEN THE system SHALL sanitize the input and perform a search on valid keywords only, WHILE showing a warning message \"Some search terms were ignored due to invalid characters.\"\n\n### Scenario 2: Inventory Synchronization Issue\nIF a seller updates inventory while a buyer is in checkout, THEN THE system SHALL check inventory one final time before payment processing, AND IF insufficient, cancel the checkout with a message \"Unfortunately, the last item you were purchasing is no longer available. Please update your cart.\"\n\n### Scenario 3: Payment Timeout\nWHEN payment processing exceeds 30 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL display a progress indicator and prevent duplicate transaction attempts, AND IF timeout occurs, allow retry with the same or different payment method.\n\nThese scenarios illustrate how the system handles common edge cases while maintaining positive user experience."}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T02:14:18.074Z","completed_at":"2025-10-15T02:17:24.259Z","step":0},{"id":"0199e5a8-6ca3-769b-8ae0-c5dbbeaaa634","type":"userMessage","contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Design the database schema."}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T02:17:24.387Z"},{"id":"0199e5a8-7f5e-72f2-892d-b2d571571aa8","type":"assistantMessage","text":"Based on the requirements analysis we've just completed, I can now proceed to the next stage: designing the database schema. This will use the Prisma agent to generate a structured database schema (using Prisma for PostgreSQL) that supports the key features you outlined—such as user management, product variants (SKUs), orders, inventory, sellers, and admin oversight. I'll keep it focused on your e-commerce platform needs without adding anything extra.\n\nTo guide the schema design, I've interpreted your request and the feature list as follows: Prioritize flexible product catalog with categories, variant support (colors, sizes, options), per-SKU inventory tracking, user and seller accounts, order processing, and admin management. This will ensure the schema handles relationships like products to variants, users to orders, and sellers to their products, with constraints for data integrity (e.g., stock levels can't go negative).\n\nIf this interpretation matches what you had in mind, I'll execute the database design now.

Neither\r\n * adding extensions with `client` component only cause other components to\r\n * recompute.\r\n */\r\ndeclare class MergedExtensionsList {\r\n    private head?;\r\n    private constructor();\r\n    static empty(): MergedExtensionsList;\r\n    static single(extension: ExtensionArgs): MergedExtensionsList;\r\n    isEmpty(): boolean;\r\n    append(extension: ExtensionArgs): MergedExtensionsList;\r\n    getAllComputedFields(dmmfModelName: string): ComputedFieldsMap | undefined;\r\n    getAllClientExtensions(): ClientArg | undefined;\r\n    getAllModelExtensions(dmmfModelName: string): ModelArg | undefined;\r\n    getAllQueryCallbacks(jsModelName: string, operation: string): any;\r\n    getAllBatchQueryCallbacks(): BatchQueryOptionsCb[];\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport declare type MergeExtArgs<TypeMap extends TypeMapDef, ExtArgs extends Record<any, any>, Args extends Record<any, any>> = ComputeDeep<ExtArgs & Args & AllModelsToStringIndex<TypeMap, Args, 'result'> & AllModelsToStringIndex<TypeMap, Args, 'model'>>;\r\n\r\nexport declare type Metric<T> = {\r\n    key: string;\r\n    value: T;\r\n    labels: Record<string, string>;\r\n    description: string;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare type MetricHistogram = {\r\n    buckets: MetricHistogramBucket[];\r\n    sum: number;\r\n    count: number;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare type MetricHistogramBucket = [maxValue: number, count: number];\r\n\r\nexport declare type Metrics = {\r\n    counters: Metric<number>[];\r\n    gauges: Metric<number>[];\r\n    histograms: Metric<MetricHistogram>[];\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare class MetricsClient {\r\n    private _client;\r\n    constructor(client: Client);\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns all metrics gathered up to this point in prometheus format.\r\n     * Result of this call can be exposed directly to prometheus scraping endpoint\r\n     *\r\n     * @param options\r\n     * @returns\r\n     */\r\n    prometheus(options?: MetricsOptions): Promise<string>;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns all metrics gathered up to this point in prometheus format.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param options\r\n     * @returns\r\n     */\r\n    json(options?: MetricsOptions): Promise<Metrics>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare type MetricsOptions = {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Labels to add to every metrics in key-value format\r\n     */\r\n    globalLabels?: Record<string, string>;\r\n};\r\n\r\ndeclare type MetricsOptionsCommon = {\r\n    globalLabels?: Record<string, string>;\r\n};\r\n\r\ndeclare type MetricsOptionsJson = {\r\n    format: 'json';\r\n} & MetricsOptionsCommon;\r\n\r\ndeclare type MetricsOptionsPrometheus = {\r\n    format: 'prometheus';\r\n} & MetricsOptionsCommon;\r\n\r\ndeclare type MiddlewareArgsMapper<RequestArgs, MiddlewareArgs> = {\r\n    requestArgsToMiddlewareArgs(requestArgs: RequestArgs): MiddlewareArgs;\r\n    middlewareArgsToRequestArgs(middlewareArgs: MiddlewareArgs): RequestArgs;\r\n};\r\n\r\ndeclare type Model = ReadonlyDeep_2<{\r\n    name: string;\r\n    dbName: string | null;\r\n    schema: string | null;\r\n    fields: Field[];\r\n    uniqueFields: string[][];\r\n    uniqueIndexes: uniqueIndex[];\r\n    documentation?: string;\r\n    primaryKey: PrimaryKey | null;\r\n    isGenerated?: boolean;\r\n}>;\r\n\r\ndeclare enum ModelAction {\r\n    findUnique = \"findUnique\",\r\n    findUniqueOrThrow = \"findUniqueOrThrow\",\r\n    findFirst = \"findFirst\",\r\n    findFirstOrThrow = \"findFirstOrThrow\",\r\n    findMany = \"findMany\",\r\n    create = \"create\",\r\n    createMany = \"createMany\",\r\n    createManyAndReturn = \"createManyAndReturn\",\r\n    update = \"update\",\r\n    updateMany = \"updateMany\",\r\n    updateManyAndReturn = \"updateManyAndReturn\",\r\n    upsert = \"upsert\",\r\n    delete = \"delete\",\r\n    deleteMany = \"deleteMany\",\r\n    groupBy = \"groupBy\",\r\n    count = \"count\",// TODO: count does not actually exist in DMMF\r\n    aggregate = \"aggregate\",\r\n    findRaw = \"findRaw\",\r\n    aggregateRaw = \"aggregateRaw\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport declare type ModelArg = {\r\n    [MethodName in string]: unknown;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare type ModelArgs = {\r\n    model: {\r\n        [ModelName in string]: ModelArg;\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport declare type ModelKey<TypeMap extends TypeMapDef, M extends PropertyKey> = M extends keyof TypeMap['model'] ?
