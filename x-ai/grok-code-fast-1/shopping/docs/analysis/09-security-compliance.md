# Security Compliance Requirements

## Purpose
This document specifies the security, privacy, and compliance requirements for the shopping platform. It focuses on protecting user data, ensuring secure authentication, and meeting regulatory standards. The requirements are written in natural language to guide business logic implementation, without specifying technical architecture or implementation details. All authentication must align with the defined user roles (buyer, seller, admin) as outlined in the [User Roles Documentation](./02-user-roles.md).

## Business Context
The shopping platform operates as an e-commerce marketplace where buyers can purchase products, sellers can list items for sale, and administrators manage the system. Security and compliance are critical because the platform handles sensitive information including user credentials, payment data, personal addresses, and financial transactions. Any security breach could result in data loss, financial harm to users, regulatory fines, and loss of trust in the platform.

## Authentication Security

### Core Authentication Requirements
THE system SHALL require all users to authenticate before accessing any personal account features.  
WHEN a user attempts to access buyer functions such as viewing order history or managing shipping addresses, THE system SHALL verify the user is logged in as a buyer role.  
WHEN a user attempts to access seller features such as updating inventory or viewing sales reports, THE system SHALL verify the user is logged in as a seller role.  
WHEN a user attempts to access admin functions such as managing all orders or resolving disputes, THE system SHALL verify the user is logged in as an admin role.  

### Session Management
THE system SHALL maintain secure user sessions throughout the shopping experience.  
WHEN a user logs in successfully, THE system SHALL create a session that expires after a reasonable period of user inactivity.  
WHEN a user's session expires, THE system SHALL require the user to log in again to continue accessing account-protected features.  
WHEN a user explicitly logs out, THE system SHALL immediately invalidate their session across all devices.  

### Password Security

WHEN a user withdraws consent for data processing, THE system SHALL immediately cease processing and delete relevant data where possible.  
WHEN third-party integrations are added, THE system SHALL obtain fresh user consent for any additional data sharing.  

### Data Processing Records
THE system SHALL maintain clear records of all data processing activities for accountability.  
WHEN processing personal data for order fulfillment, THE system SHALL document the lawful basis and purpose of processing.  
WHEN sharing data with third parties (such as shipping providers), THE system SHALL record the legal justification and data protection safeguards.  
WHEN handling data breaches, THE system SHALL document incident response records for compliance reporting.  

## PCI DSS Requirements

### Cardholder Data Protection
THE system SHALL protect all payment card information in accordance with industry standards.  
WHEN storing payment methods for future purchases, THE system SHALL never store complete card numbers or security codes.  
WHEN processing payments, THE system SHALL mask card numbers in all system displays and logs.  
WHEN transmitting payment data between systems, THE system SHALL use secure, encrypted communication channels.  

### Secure Payment Processing
THE system SHALL process all payment transactions through secure, PCI-compliant gateways.  
WHEN a buyer submits payment information, THE system SHALL validate the data before processing.  
WHEN a payment transaction fails, THE system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages without exposing payment details.  
WHEN processing refunds or chargebacks, THE system SHALL follow secure procedures that protect financial information.  

### Audit and Monitoring
THE system SHALL maintain detailed audit logs of all payment-related activities.  
WHEN payment processing occurs, THE system SHALL record transaction details for compliance and fraud prevention.

## Authorization Rules

### User Role Permissions
THE system SHALL enforce role-based access control for all platform functions.  
WHEN a buyer attempts to list products for sale, THE system SHALL deny access because only sellers can manage inventory.  
WHEN a seller attempts to view admin reports, THE system SHALL deny access because admin functions require admin privileges.  
WHEN an admin modifies seller account settings, THE system SHALL require admin authentication and log the action for audit purposes.  

### Feature-Specific Authorization
THE system SHALL control access to sensitive features based on user roles and context.  
WHEN reviewing product listings, only authorized users (product owners or admins) SHALL have permission to make changes.

WHEN users attempt to modify their own permissions, THE system SHALL deny such requests.  
WHEN admin functions are accessed, THE system SHALL require multi-factor verification.  
WHEN role changes are requested, THE system SHALL require approval from higher-authority users.  

## Related Considerations
This security framework builds upon the user roles and authentication requirements defined in the [User Roles Documentation](./02-user-roles.md). All authentication mechanisms must support the three defined roles: buyers (for shopping activities), sellers (for product management), and admins (for system oversight). Security measures should be applied consistently across all platform features mentioned in the core features and business rules documentation.
