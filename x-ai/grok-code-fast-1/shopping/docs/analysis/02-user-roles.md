# Requirements Analysis Report for E-Commerce Shopping Mall Platform

## Introduction

### Purpose of This Document
This Requirements Analysis Report provides a comprehensive specification of the business requirements for the E-Commerce Shopping Mall Platform. The document focuses exclusively on business logic, user interactions, and functional capabilities in natural language, removing all ambiguity for backend developers.

### Scope
The platform will support three primary user roles: buyers (customers), sellers (merchants), and admins (system managers). Key features include user registration and address management, product catalog with search, product variants with SKU, shopping cart and wishlist, order processing, payment integration, shipping tracking, product reviews, seller account management, inventory tracking, order history and cancellation/refunds, and admin oversight.

Additional business processes include order fulfillment workflows, inventory synchronization, seller verification processes, and automated notifications for all user interactions.

### Business Context
The platform serves as a comprehensive digital marketplace where buyers can discover and purchase products, sellers can list and manage their inventory, and administrators can oversee platform operations. Revenue will be generated through transaction fees, seller subscriptions, or advertising.

### Assumptions
- Users have basic internet access and familiarity with online shopping.
- Payment processing will integrate with third-party gateways.
- Shipping will be handled by external providers with API tracking.
- The platform will operate 24/7 with high availability.

### Success Criteria
- Buyers can complete purchases effortlessly with clear product information and secure payments.
- Sellers can effectively manage their product listings and sales analytics.
- Admins can monitor and moderate all platform activities.
- System response times remain under 2 seconds for critical operations.

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams
The platform will generate revenue through multiple channels:
- Commission fees on successful transactions (e.g., 5-10% per sale)
- Premium seller subscriptions for enhanced features like analytics and priority support
- Advertising placements for featured products or categories
- Optional shipping and fulfillment services

### Market Position
This platform differentiates itself through:
- Comprehensive product variant management with detailed SKUs
- Transparent seller ratings and review systems
- Robust inventory synchronization across sellers

### Growth Strategy
- Acquire initial sellers through partnerships with existing merchants
- Attract buyers through SEO optimization and social media marketing
- Expand geography after successful domestic launch
- Add marketplace features like live chat support and AI recommendations

WHEN a seller registers an account, THE system SHALL collect business information including tax ID and verification documents.

WHEN a buyer completes a purchase, THE system SHALL process payment through integrated gateways and confirm transaction within 3 seconds.

IF a seller achieves performance benchmarks, THEN THE system SHALL reduce their commission fees automatically.

## User Roles and Authentication

### Role Definitions
The system supports three primary user roles:

**Buyer (Customer)**: Authenticated users who can browse products, add items to cart/wishlist, place orders, track shipments, leave reviews, manage addresses, and view order history. They have read-only access to product information and limited account management capabilities.

During buyer registration, WHEN a buyer provides registration details, THE system SHALL validate email format and ensure unique email addresses. WHILE a buyer browses products, THE system SHALL allow adding items to cart without authentication. IF a buyer attempts to checkout without login, THEN THE system SHALL prompt authentication before proceeding.

**Seller (Merchant)**: Authenticated users who can create and manage product listings with variants, manage inventory per SKU, view sales analytics, process refunds, and update shipping status. They have restricted access limited to their own products and sales data.

WHEN a seller registers, THE system SHALL require additional business verification beyond standard user registration. WHILE sellers manage products, THE system SHALL restrict access to their own listings only. IF a seller attempts unauthorized access to other sellers' data, THEN THE system SHALL deny access and log the incident.

**Admin**: System administrators with elevated permissions to manage all user accounts, review seller approvals, moderate product listings and reviews, oversee all orders, and access system-wide analytics and settings.

WHEN an admin logs in, THE system SHALL require multi-factor authentication for enhanced security. WHILE admins review seller applications, THE system SHALL provide comprehensive verification tools. IF an admin modifies user accounts, THEN THE system SHALL log all changes for audit purposes.

### Authentication Requirements
WHEN a user attempts to register, THE system SHALL validate email format and password strength (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character).

WHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL authenticate and respond within 1.5 seconds for 95% of requests.

WHILE a user session is active, THE system SHALL maintain session integrity and expire sessions after 24 hours of inactivity.

IF authentication fails due to invalid credentials, THE system SHALL attempt to distinguish between invalid username and password and provide appropriate feedback without revealing account existence.

WHEN a user requests password reset, THE system SHALL send a secure email link valid for 15 minutes and require current password knowledge if logged in.

THE system SHALL support social media authentication integration for faster registration.

### Permission Matrix

| Feature | Buyer | Seller | Admin |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Browse products | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Search products | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Add to cart/wishlist | Yes | No | No |
| Place orders | Yes | No | No |
| Track orders | Yes | No | Yes |
| Leave reviews | Yes | No | No |
| Manage own products | No | Yes | No |
| View sales analytics | No | Yes | Yes |
| Manage inventory | No | Yes | No |
| Moderate content | No | No | Yes |
| Approve sellers | No | No | Yes |
| System administration | No | No | Yes |

WHEN a buyer attempts to access seller features, THE system SHALL redirect to buyer dashboard with appropriate messaging. WHILE sellers manage their products, THE system SHALL restrict viewing other sellers' data. WHERE admin oversight is required, THE system SHALL log all admin actions for compliance.
