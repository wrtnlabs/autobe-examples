# Core Features and Business Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the core features and business requirements for the e-commerce shopping mall platform (service prefix: shoppingPlatform). It specifies the functional requirements that must be implemented to support the platform's business operations. All requirements are expressed in natural language using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format where applicable, focusing exclusively on business logic and user needs rather than technical implementation details.

The platform supports three primary user roles as defined in the user roles documentation:
- Buyers: Authenticated users who browse, purchase, and track orders
- Sellers: Authenticated users who manage product listings and inventory
- Admins: System administrators with oversight of platform operations

These requirements build upon the user journeys defined in the related user journeys document.
