# Requirements Analysis Report for E-Commerce Shopping Mall Platform

## Introduction

### Purpose of This Document
This Requirements Analysis Report provides a comprehensive specification of user-facing error scenarios and recovery processes for the E-Commerce Shopping Mall Platform. The document focuses exclusively on business logic, user interactions, and functional requirements in natural language, removing all ambiguity for backend developers. All error handling must align with the platform's business model of connecting authenticated buyers, verified sellers, and administrative oversight in a secure marketplace.

### Scope
The platform serves buyers (purchasing products), sellers (managing listings and inventory), and administrators (overseeing operations). Error handling covers all aspects including registration, authentication, product operations, payment processing, order management, and administrative functions. Error scenarios are described from a user experience perspective, focusing on clear communication, graceful recovery, and maintaining trust in the marketplace.

### Business Context
Errors are inevitable in a complex e-commerce system handling payments, inventory, and logistics. The business priority is user satisfaction and trust maintenance. WHEN users encounter errors, THE system SHALL provide clear, actionable guidance that enables successful completion of intended business activities. WHERE errors prevent core business flows, THE system SHALL offer alternative paths that preserve user progress and maintain marketplace integrity.

### Assumptions
Users expect responsive, clear error communications during shopping activities. All error handling prioritizes business continuity over technical details. Error messages use natural language appropriate for the e-commerce context.

### Success Criteria
The platform achieves success when error recovery enables 95%+ of interrupted transactions to complete successfully. Users encountering errors report satisfaction scores above 3.5 out of 5 stars. System prevents errors through proactive business validation.

## Business Model Context
The platform operates as a multi-sided marketplace monetized through transaction fees. Error handling protects revenue by maintaining user engagement during payment failures, ensuring inventory accuracy during stock issues, and preserving seller confidence during operational disruptions.

WHEN a buyer encounters an authentication error, THE system SHALL provide secure recovery that restores marketplace access without compromising security.

WHEN a seller experiences inventory inconsistency errors, THE system SHALL enable accurate stock reconciliation to maintain marketplace trust.

WHEN payment processing fails, THE system SHALL offer multiple recovery options that preserve transaction intent while protecting financial security.
