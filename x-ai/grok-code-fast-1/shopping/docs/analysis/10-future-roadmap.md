# Core Features and Business Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the core features and business requirements for the e-commerce shopping mall platform (service prefix: shoppingPlatform). It specifies the functional requirements that must be implemented to support the platform's business operations. All requirements are expressed in natural language using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format where applicable, focusing exclusively on business logic and user needs rather than technical implementation details.

The platform supports three primary user roles as defined in the user roles documentation:
- Buyers: Authenticated users who browse, purchase, and track orders
- Sellers: Authenticated users who manage product listings and inventory
- Admins: System administrators with oversight of platform operations

These requirements build upon the user journeys defined in the related [User Journey Documentation](./03-user-journeys.md).

## Overall System Architecture

The system architecture is designed to support a marketplace where multiple sellers offer products to buyers, with administration oversight. The platform consists of interconnected modules for user management, product catalog management, order processing, and administrative functions.

## Feature Interactions

The features interact in several key ways to create a seamless e-commerce experience:

```

This diagram shows how buyer shopping flows integrate with seller inventory management and admin oversight functions. For example, when a seller updates inventory (I), it immediately affects product availability in buyer browsing (B). Admin reviews of seller listings (L) ensure products meet platform standards before appearing in buyer searches.

## Business Processes and Workflows

### Purchase Process Workflow

WHEN a buyer completes registration and authentication, THE buyer SHALL browse the product catalog using search and filtering capabilities. WHEN products are added to cart with valid variant selections, THE system SHALL check inventory availability and reserve items temporarily. WHEN checkout is initiated, THE system SHALL calculate totals, validate payment information, and process the transaction. WHEN payment succeeds, THE system SHALL create orders, notify sellers, and provide tracking capabilities to buyers.

### Seller Onboarding Workflow

WHEN a business registers as a seller, THE system SHALL collect verification documents and business information. WHEN verification is complete, THE system SHALL activate seller accounts with dashboard access. WHEN sellers create products with variants and SKUs, THE system SHALL validate uniqueness and publish to the catalog. WHEN orders arrive, THE system SHALL notify sellers and provide fulfillment tools.

### Admin Moderation Workflow

WHEN admins access the dashboard, THE system SHALL display pending tasks including new seller verifications and flagged content. WHEN reviewing seller applications, THE system SHALL provide tools for approval or rejection with detailed feedback. WHEN monitoring product listings, THE system SHALL enable bulk actions for compliance enforcement.

## Success Criteria

The platform SHALL be considered successful when:
- 95% of registered users complete at least one purchase within 30 days
- Average order processing time is under 5 minutes during peak hours
- 99% order accuracy with no inventory discrepancies reported
- Customer satisfaction rating above 4.5 out of 5 stars on post-purchase surveys
- Seller onboarding time reduced to under 2 business days after document submission
- System handles 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation exceed 10% slowdown
- Average session duration exceeds 5 minutes during first month of platform operation
- Mobile user conversion rate matches desktop performance within 15% variance

## Assumptions and Dependencies

This document assumes:
- Third-party payment gateways support secure API integrations as detailed in the [External Integrations Documentation](./07-external-integrations.md)
- Shipping providers offer real-time tracking APIs with webhook notifications
- Email notification services maintain 99.9% delivery success rate
- Database systems support the transaction volumes described in [Performance Expectations](./08-performance-expectations.md)
- Legal compliance requirements are met as specified in [Security Compliance Documentation](./09-security-compliance.md)
- User roles and authentication patterns follow the system defined in [User Roles Documentation](./02-user-roles.md)

## Data Validation and Error Handling Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Invalid Product Search
WHEN a buyer enters an invalid search term containing special characters not supported in the search algorithm, THEN THE system SHALL sanitize the input and perform a search on valid keywords only, WHILE showing a warning message "Some search terms were ignored due to invalid characters."

### Scenario 2: Inventory Synchronization Issue
IF a seller updates inventory while a buyer is in checkout, THEN THE system SHALL check inventory one final time before payment processing, AND IF insufficient, cancel the checkout with a message "Unfortunately, the last item you were purchasing is no longer available. Please update your cart."

### Scenario 3: Payment Timeout
WHEN payment processing exceeds 30 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL display a progress indicator and prevent duplicate transaction attempts, AND IF timeout occurs, allow retry with the same or different payment method.

These scenarios illustrate how the system handles common edge cases while maintaining positive user experience.
