# Service Vision

## Business Model

### Why This Service Exists
The primary business purpose of the shopping mall platform is to create a comprehensive online marketplace that connects buyers seeking products with sellers wanting to reach broader audiences. This marketplace addresses the growing need for convenient, reliable e-commerce solutions in an increasingly digital economy, particularly benefiting small to medium-sized businesses that lack the resources to build their own online presence.

### Revenue Strategy
The platform generates revenue through multiple streams to ensure financial sustainability:
- Transaction fees charged as a percentage (typically 5-15%) of each successful sale processed through the platform
- Premium seller subscriptions offering enhanced visibility, analytics tools, and priority support
- Advertising slots for featured products or sponsored listings
- Data insights services sold to sellers wishing to understand market trends and customer behavior

### Growth Plan
User acquisition will focus initially on local markets, expanding regionally through partnerships with influencers, social media marketing, and referral programs. Retention strategies include personalized recommendations, loyalty rewards, and excellent customer service. Sellers will be attracted through low entry barriers, comprehensive support, and proven sales growth opportunities. The platform will scale by investing in technology improvements like advanced search, AI-driven recommendations, and mobile optimization.

### Success Metrics
Key performance indicators include:
- Monthly active users: Target 10,000+ buyers and 500+ sellers within the first year
- Transaction volume: Process $1M+ in sales monthly
- Seller retention: Maintain 80%+ active seller participation after six months
