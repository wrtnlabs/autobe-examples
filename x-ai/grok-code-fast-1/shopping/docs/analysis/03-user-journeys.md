# Requirements Analysis Report for E-Commerce Shopping Mall Platform

## Introduction

### Purpose of This Document
This Requirements Analysis Report provides a comprehensive specification of the business requirements for the E-Commerce Shopping Mall Platform. The document focuses exclusively on business logic, user interactions, and functional capabilities in natural language, removing all ambiguity for backend developers.

### Scope
The platform will support three primary user roles: buyers (customers), sellers (merchants), and admins (system managers). Key features include user registration and address management, product catalog with search, product variants with SKU, shopping cart and wishlist, order processing, payment integration, shipping tracking, product reviews, seller account management, inventory tracking, order history and cancellation/refunds, and admin oversight.

### Business Context
The platform serves as a comprehensive digital marketplace where buyers can discover and purchase products, sellers can list and manage their inventory, and administrators can oversee platform operations. Revenue will be generated through transaction fees, seller subscriptions, or advertising.

### Assumptions
- Users have basic internet access and familiarity with online shopping.
- Payment processing will integrate with third-party gateways.

## User Roles and Authentication

### Role Definitions
The system supports three primary user roles:

**Buyer (Customer)**: Authenticated users who can browse products, add items to cart/wishlist, place orders, track shipments, leave reviews, manage addresses, and view order history. They have read-only access to product information and limited account management capabilities.

**Seller (Merchant)**: Authenticated users who can create and manage product listings with variants, manage inventory per SKU, view sales analytics, process refunds, and update shipping status. They have restricted access limited to their own products and sales data.

**Admin**: System administrators with elevated permissions to manage all user accounts, review seller approvals, moderate product listings and reviews, oversee all orders, and access system-wide analytics and settings.
