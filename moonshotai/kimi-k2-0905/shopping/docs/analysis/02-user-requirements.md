# User Requirements Analysis - E-commerce Shopping Mall Platform

## Executive Summary

This document defines comprehensive user management and authentication requirements for the shoppingMall e-commerce platform. The system supports four distinct user roles: guests, customers, sellers, and administrators, each with specific permissions and capabilities. The platform provides seamless user registration, secure authentication, comprehensive address management, and role-based access control to support a multi-vendor marketplace environment.

## User Roles and Permissions

### Role Hierarchy and Business Context

**THE platform SHALL implement four distinct user roles with escalating permissions:**

**Guest Users** represent non-authenticated visitors who can browse the marketplace without creating an account. Guests have read-only access to product catalogs, categories, and search functionality but cannot perform any transactional operations.

**Customer Users** are registered platform members who can complete the full shopping lifecycle. Customers can browse products, manage shopping carts and wishlists, place orders, write product reviews, and maintain multiple shipping addresses for their account.

**Seller Users** are business account holders who operate their own shops within the marketplace. Sellers can create and manage product catalogs with variants, track inventory levels per SKU, process customer orders, manage business information, and access sales analytics for their shop performance.

**Administrator Users** are platform staff who oversee marketplace operations. Administrators can manage all user accounts, moderate content including products and reviews, process refunds and disputes, configure system settings, and access comprehensive platform analytics.

### Permission Matrix by Role

WHEN admin users access role permissions, THE system SHALL display this comprehensive capability matrix formatted exactly as follows:

    subgraph "User Actions"
    A["Browse Products"] --> B["Product Categories"]
    C["Shopping Cart"] --> D["Order Placement"]
    E["Wishlist Management"] --> F["Review System"]
    G["Seller Account"] --> H["Product Management"]
    end;
    
    subgraph "Permissions"
    I["Guest"] --> |"Read Only"|A
    J["Customer"] --> |"Full Access"|C
    J --> |"Limited"|D
    J --> |"Full Access"|E
    K["Seller"] --> |"Full Access"|C
    K --> |"Limited"|H
    L["Admin"] --> |"Full Access"|G
    L --> |"Full Access"|H
    end;
```

THE permission structure SHALL strictly enforce these business rules:

- **Guest Users** can view catalog, categories, search results, and basic company information
- **Customer Users** gain all guest capabilities plus cart, wishlist, checkout, order history, address management, and review submission
- **Seller Users** receive customer capabilities plus complete product catalog control, order processing, inventory tracking, sales analytics, and customer communication tools
- **Administrator Users** receive all capabilities plus platform administration, user management, financial oversight, system configuration, and comprehensive monitoring

### Role Transition Rules

**WHEN a customer user applies for seller account status, THE system SHALL validate business information and approve or deny the request within 5 business days.**

**THE system SHALL maintain historical data when users transition between roles, ensuring order history and profile information remain accessible.**

**IF a seller account is suspended or terminated, THEN THE system SHALL preserve customer-facing product information while disabling transactional capabilities.**

## Registration Requirements

**WHEN a user attempts login, THE system SHALL implement rate limiting allowing maximum 5 failed attempts per 15-minute window per IP address.**

**IF a user exceeds failed login attempts, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 30 minutes and send security notification emails to the registered email address.**

**THE system SHALL generate JWT tokens with 15-minute access token expiration and 7-day refresh token expiration for authenticated users.**

**WHILE users remain authenticated, SHALL maintain active sessions allowing seamless navigation across all permitted platform areas without repeated authentication prompts.**

### Password Security and Recovery

**THE system SHALL enforce password complexity requiring minimum 8 characters including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.**

**THE system SHALL hash passwords using bcrypt or stronger encryption before storage, with unique salts per user credential.**

**WHEN users request password reset, THE system SHALL send a unique reset link to the registered email address that expires after 1 hour.**

**IF a password reset request originates from an unrecognized device or IP address, THEN THE system SHALL require additional identity verification through email confirmation before allowing password change.**

**THE system SHALL provide backup recovery codes that users can store securely offline for account access. WHEN primary authentication methods become unavailable, these recovery codes enable account recovery without customer service intervention.**

**IF a user loses access to their two-factor authentication device, THEN THE system SHALL implement identity verification through email confirmation, security questions, and identity document verification before allowing account recovery.**

### Account Activity Monitoring

**THE system SHALL monitor user account activities including login locations, device fingerprinting, login timing patterns, password reset requests, and suspicious activity indicators through machine learning algorithms.**

**WHEN unusual account activity is detected such as access from unusual geographic locations, the system SHALL send immediate security alerts to registered email addresses within 5 minutes while limiting account activities pending security verification.**

**THE system SHALL allow users to view comprehensive recent account activity including complete login history with device identification, geographic location information, session durations, and any automated security actions taken by the platform.**

## Integration Requirements

This comprehensive user requirements document establishes foundational authentication and authorization requirements that directly impact all other platform modules including product catalog browsing permissions, shopping cart functionality, order processing authorization systems, seller portal access controls, payment security integration, and administrative dashboard authentication requirements.

The defined user roles and permission structure must be consistently applied across all subsequent technical system modules to maintain security standards, preserve user experience consistency, and ensure appropriate authorization controls throughout the complete platform ecosystem.

> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**. All technical implementations (architecture, APIs, database design, etc.) are at the discretion of the development team.*
