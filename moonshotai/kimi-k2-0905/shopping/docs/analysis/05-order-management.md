# Order Management System Requirements Analysis

## Executive Summary

The order management system serves as the backbone of the shopping-mall platform, orchestrating the complete order lifecycle from initial placement through final fulfillment. This system must handle complex multi-vendor marketplace scenarios where customers can purchase products from multiple sellers in a single order while maintaining accurate inventory tracking, processing payments, and providing real-time status updates to all stakeholders.

## Order Placement Process

### Order Initiation
WHEN a customer clicks the "Place Order" button with a non-empty cart, THE system SHALL validate the following conditions before order creation:
- All products in cart are still available in requested quantities
- No inventory has been reserved by other customers since cart creation
- Customer's primary address is configured and verified
- Payment method is properly configured and valid
- Seller account status is active for all vendors in the order

### Order Creation Workflow
THE system SHALL process order creation through these sequential steps:

1. **Inventory Lock Process**
   WHEN a customer initiates checkout, THE system SHALL reserve inventory quantities for each product variant (SKU) in the cart for a maximum of 15 minutes
   WHILE inventory is reserved, THE system SHALL prevent other customers from purchasing those reserved quantities
   IF inventory reservation fails due to insufficient stock, THEN THE system SHALL notify the customer which items became unavailable and offer to modify the cart

2. **Multi-Vendor Order Splitting**
   WHEN an order contains products from multiple sellers, THE system SHALL automatically create separate order sub-orders for each seller
   THE system SHALL ensure each seller receives only their applicable items while preserving the customer-facing order as a unified shopping experience
   THE system SHALL calculate separate shipping costs, taxes, and seller margins for each sub-order

3. **Payment Authorization**
   WHEN inventory reservation succeeds, THE system SHALL proceed to payment authorization
   THE system SHALL authorize the full order amount on customer's payment method but capture funds only upon order confirmation
   IF payment authorization fails, THEN THE system SHALL release all reserved inventory and notify customer of payment failure with retry options

4. **Order Confirmation**
   WHEN payment authorization succeeds, THE system SHALL capture payment and create the order
   THE system SHALL assign a unique order number in format ORD-{YYYY}{MM}{DD}-{8-digit-sequence}
   THE system SHALL set initial order status to "Confirmed" for customers and "Pending" for sellers

### Order Validation Rules
THE system SHALL enforce the following business rules during order placement:
- Minimum order value must be $10.00 before shipping and taxes
- Maximum single product quantity per order is 999 units
- Customer must have verified email address for orders over $500
- International orders require phone number verification
- Business customers (with tax ID) receive automatic tax exemption application

## Order Status Tracking

### Order Status Lifecycle
THE system SHALL maintain and track the following order status values with specific allowed transitions:
