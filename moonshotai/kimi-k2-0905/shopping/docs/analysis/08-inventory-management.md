# ShoppingMall Platform - Inventory Management Requirements

## Executive Summary

The inventory management system for ShoppingMall platform provides comprehensive stock tracking and control capabilities for a multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace. This system enables sellers to manage their product inventory at the SKU level, provides real-time stock visibility to customers, and ensures accurate inventory synchronization across all platform operations. The system includes automated alert mechanisms, reservation capabilities, and detailed reporting features to optimize inventory management for thousands of sellers and millions of product variants.

## Business Model Context

### Market Position
ShoppingMall operates as a multi-vendor marketplace where individual sellers manage their own inventory while customers experience a unified shopping interface. Inventory accuracy directly impacts customer satisfaction, seller credibility, and platform reputation.

### Key Business Value
- **Customer Trust**: Real-time inventory prevents overselling and disappointment
- **Seller Success**: Automated alerts and reporting optimize stock management
- **Platform Growth**: Accurate inventory attracts more sellers and customers
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated systems reduce manual inventory management

## Inventory Tracking Per SKU

### Core Inventory Structure

THE inventory system SHALL track stock quantities at the SKU level for all product variants. Each product variant combination (color, size, configuration) maintains independent inventory records with unique SKU identifiers.

WHEN a seller creates or updates a product variant, THE system SHALL require inventory quantity specification. THE quantity SHALL be a non-negative integer representing available stock units.

THE system SHALL maintain the following inventory data per SKU:
- Current available quantity
- Reserved quantity for pending orders
- Sold quantity for analytics
- Restock history with timestamps
- Inventory value calculations
- Warehouse location information (optional for sellers)

### SKU-Level Inventory Rules

THE system SHALL enforce these business rules for inventory management:

WHEN inventory quantity is set to zero, THE product variant SHALL be marked as "out of stock" and hidden from customer search results.

WHEN inventory quantity is positive, THE product variant SHALL be visible to customers for purchase.

THE system SHALL prevent negative inventory quantities. WHEN an inventory update would result in negative value, THE system SHALL reject the update and log the attempt.

IF a product variant has no inventory record, THEN THE system SHALL treat it as "out of stock" until inventory is set.

### Multi-Variant Inventory Management

THE system SHALL support complex product structures where parent products contain multiple variant dimensions. For example, a shirt product may have size variants (S, M, L, XL) and color variants (red, blue, green), creating 12 unique SKU combinations.

WHEN a customer views a product, THE system SHALL display inventory status for each variant combination. THE display SHALL indicate "in stock", "low stock", or "out of stock" based on current quantities.

## Stock Level Management

### Inventory Threshold Controls

THE system SHALL implement a three-tier inventory status system:

**In Stock**: Available quantity exceeds the low stock threshold
**Low Stock**: Available quantity is at or below the low stock threshold but above zero
**Out of Stock**: Available quantity equals zero

THE low stock threshold SHALL be configurable per SKU by sellers. The default threshold SHALL be 10 units. THE threshold must be a positive integer.

THE system SHALL automatically update product display when inventory status changes between these tiers. Customer-facing indicators SHALL reflect the current stock level immediately upon status change.

### Batch Inventory Updates

THE system SHALL support bulk inventory updates for sellers managing multiple SKUs. WHEN a seller uploads inventory changes via file or bulk interface, THE system SHALL:

Validate all SKU identifiers exist and belong to the seller
Process updates in a transaction to ensure data consistency
Provide detailed results showing successful updates, failures, and warnings
Send notifications for any products that moved to "low stock" or "out of stock" status

THE system SHALL maintain an audit trail of all inventory changes including the old value, new value, timestamp, and user who made the change.

## Low Stock Alerts

### Automated Alert System

THE system SHALL monitor inventory levels continuously and automatically generate alerts when stock falls below thresholds.

WHEN available inventory for any SKU reaches or falls below the low stock threshold, THE system SHALL immediately send an alert to the product's seller. The alert SHALL include:
- Product name and SKU identifier
- Current stock level
- Low stock threshold value
- Recommended restock quantity (based on sales velocity)

### Alert Configuration Options

THE system SHALL allow sellers to configure their alert preferences:

Notification channels: email, SMS, platform notification
Alert frequency: immediate, daily digest, weekly summary
Threshold customization: per-SKU threshold settings
Alert recipients: primary contact, additional team members

WHERE low stock alerts are configured, THE system SHALL deliver notifications through the seller's selected channels within 15 minutes of the threshold breach.

### Sales Velocity Integration

THE system SHALL calculate sales velocity for each SKU based on historical sales data. The calculation SHALL consider order volume over the past 30 days to identify fast-moving products.

WHEN generating low stock alerts, THE system SHALL include restock recommendations based on current sales velocity. For high-velocity products, THE system SHALL recommend larger restock quantities.

## Inventory Synchronization

### Real-Time Updates

THE system SHALL maintain inventory synchronization across all customer touchpoints. WHEN inventory changes occur, THE system SHALL update:

Product search results and category listings
Product detail pages showing variant availability
Shopping cart availability indicators
Checkout process stock validation

THE synchronization SHALL occur within 2 seconds of inventory changes to prevent customer confusion and overselling scenarios.

### Channel Synchronization

FOR sellers using external systems or multiple sales channels, THE system SHALL provide API endpoints for inventory synchronization. THE API SHALL support:

Real-time inventory queries
Batch inventory updates
Inventory reservation confirmation
Synchronization status reporting

THE system SHALL implement conflict resolution when inventory updates occur from multiple sources simultaneously. The most recent timestamp SHALL take precedence, with detailed logging of all changes.

## Reservation System

### Cart Reservations

THE system SHALL reserve inventory when customers add products to their shopping cart. WHEN a product is added to cart, THE system SHALL:

Reserve the quantity for a configurable time period (default: 30 minutes)
Decrease the available inventory shown to other customers
Display countdown timers showing reservation expiration
Provide clear reservation notifications to customers

THE reservation SHALL be released automatically when the timer expires. The reserved inventory SHALL return to available stock immediately upon reservation release.

### Checkout Reservations

THE system SHALL extend inventory reservations during the checkout process. WHEN a customer proceeds to checkout, THE reservation period SHALL be extended to ensure sufficient time for payment processing.

IF payment fails or checkout is abandoned, THEN THE reservation SHALL be released within 5 minutes. The system SHALL notify the customer that their reservation has expired.

THE system SHALL prevent overselling by validating inventory availability at critical points:
- Cart addition
- Checkout initiation
- Payment processing
- Order confirmation

### Reservation Priority

WHEN inventory is limited, THE system SHALL prioritize reservations based on chronological order. The customer who added the item to cart first receives priority for the available inventory.

THE reservation system SHALL handle edge cases gracefully:
- Multiple customers attempting to reserve the last item
- Reservation expiration during active sessions
- Reservation conflicts during high-demand periods

## Inventory Reporting

### Seller Analytics Dashboard

THE system SHALL provide comprehensive inventory analytics for sellers including:

Current stock levels across all SKUs
Products approaching low stock thresholds
Slow-moving inventory requiring attention
Stock value calculations and cost analysis
Inventory turnover rates by category
Seasonal demand patterns

THE dashboard SHALL display real-time data with customizable date ranges and filtering options by product category, brand, or individual SKU.

### Platform-Level Reporting

FOR platform administrators, THE system SHALL provide aggregate inventory reports:

Total inventory value across all sellers
Platform-wide stock movement patterns
Category performance metrics
Inventory aging reports
Restock forecast recommendations

THE reporting SHALL support data export in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, JSON) for external analysis and accounting systems integration.

### Predictive Analytics

THE system SHALL analyze historical sales patterns to predict future inventory needs. The predictions SHALL consider:

Seasonal demand variations
Promotional campaign impacts
Market trending patterns
Seller-specific performance history

THE predictive analytics SHALL generate recommended restock quantities and timing to optimize inventory levels and minimize stockouts.

## Inventory Adjustment Workflows

### Manual Adjustments

THE system SHALL support manual inventory adjustments for sellers with appropriate business justification. WHEN processing manual adjustments, THE system SHALL:

Require reason codes (damaged goods, returns, theft, data correction, etc.)
Implement approval workflows for large adjustments
Maintain detailed audit logs
Generate adjustment reports for accounting

THE system SHALL track adjustment patterns and flag unusual activity for seller or admin review.

### Return Processing

THE system SHALL handle inventory returns through structured workflows. WHEN customer returns are processed, THE inventory SHALL be updated according to the return condition:

New/unopened items: Add to available inventory immediately
Opened/lightly used: Add to available inventory with condition notes
Damaged/defective: Do not add to available inventory

THE system SHALL coordinate with the order management and payment systems to ensure consistent handling across all processes.

## Integration Requirements

### Product Catalog Integration

THE inventory system SHALL integrate seamlessly with the product catalog management ([Product Catalog Requirements](./03-product-catalog.md)). Inventory status SHALL automatically update product visibility and pricing rules.

WHEN inventory reaches zero for a product variant, THE system SHALL immediately update the product catalog to remove the variant from customer-facing listings.

### Seller Portal Integration

Inventory management SHALL be fully accessible through the seller portal ([Seller Portal Requirements](./06-seller-portal.md)) providing sellers with complete control over their stock levels and alert preferences.

THE system SHALL support role-based access for seller teams, allowing inventory managers to handle bulk updates while customer service handles individual inquiries.

### Order Management Integration

THE system SHALL maintain tight integration with order management ([Order Management Requirements](./05-order-management.md)) to ensure accurate inventory allocation throughout the order lifecycle.

WHEN orders are canceled, returned, or modified, THE system SHALL automatically adjust inventory reservations and available quantities accordingly.

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Standards

THE inventory system SHALL meet strict performance requirements:

- Inventory queries: Response within 200ms
- Inventory updates: Process within 500ms
- Bulk operations: Complete within 5 seconds for 1000 SKUs
- Synchronization updates: Propagate within 2 seconds

THE system SHALL handle concurrent inventory operations without data inconsistencies or race conditions.

### Scalability Expectations

THE system SHALL scale to support:
- 1 million+ active SKUs across all sellers
- 10,000+ simultaneous inventory operations
- 99.9% uptime availability
- Sub-second response times under normal load

THE architecture SHALL accommodate platform growth without degradation of inventory accuracy or performance.

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Inventory Discrepancies

THE system SHALL detect and handle inventory discrepancies through automated reconciliation processes. WHEN discrepancies are identified, THE system SHALL:

Log the discrepancy with detailed context
Notify affected sellers and administrators
Generate reconciliation reports
Provide tools for manual adjustment with audit trail

THE system SHALL implement automated reconciliation between recorded inventory and actual sales data to identify potential issues proactively.

### System Failure Recovery

THE system SHALL implement robust error handling for system failures affecting inventory accuracy. In case of payment processing failures, system outages, or network interruptions, THE system SHALL:

Release appropriate reservations without user action
Maintain data consistency across all systems
