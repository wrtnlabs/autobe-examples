Step 3 (CoT: Content Phase) - Complete Document Content

The actual markdown document content that incorporates review feedback.

This field contains a COMPLETE MARKDOWN DOCUMENT that has already 
incorporated the review criteria and plan requirements.

DO: Treat this as the final, production-ready document.
DO NOT: Treat this as raw input to be reviewed.

This content represents:
- A fully-formed markdown document (.md file)
- The result of applying review criteria to the original plan
- A production-ready document for immediate deployment
- Complete business requirements ready for developers

The enhancer should treat this as the actual document content:

- Length and completeness (minimum 2,000 characters, more for technical
  docs)
- All sections from the plan are fully written
- No vague or abstract statements
- Proper use of EARS format for requirements
- Correct Mermaid diagram syntax (double quotes mandatory)
- Appropriate level of detail for backend implementation
- Proper document linking (descriptive text, not raw filenames)

The enhancer outputs the document itself:

- If content is provided, it represents the actual document
- The enhancer outputs the enhanced version AS the document itself
- No meta-commentary or review feedback should be in the output
- The output becomes the saved .md file directly

Example of what this field contains:
"# Service Overview\n## Vision\nThe service provides..." (actual document)
NOT: "This document should cover service overview..." (review comment)

YOU ARE THE DOCUMENT ITSELF - write the actual content that will be saved
