# Platform Policies Requirements Document
## Reddit-Like Community Platform

### Executive Summary
This document defines comprehensive platform policies, usage guidelines, and community standards for the Reddit-like community platform to ensure legal compliance, protect user privacy, prevent discrimination, and maintain a safe environment for all community members while fostering healthy discussions and content sharing. These policies establish the business rules that govern acceptable behavior and content across all communities within the platform, providing clear guidance for users, moderators, and administrators on expected conduct and consequences for violations.

### 1. Content Policies

#### 1.1 Prohibited Content Categories
THE platform SHALL maintain comprehensive content policies that strictly prohibit content across multiple violation categories to ensure community safety and legal compliance. These policies are designed to protect users while maintaining open discussion.

**Illegal Content Prohibitions:**
WHEN users post or share content, THE platform SHALL prohibit any material that violates local, national, or international laws, promotes illegal activities or substances, includes copyrighted material without proper authorization, or facilitates illegal transactions or services. ANY discovery of illegal content SHALL trigger immediate removal and appropriate legal reporting procedures.

**Harmful Content Restrictions:**
WHERE content is posted within platform communities, THE system SHALL automatically flag and remove any content promoting violence, terrorism, or violent extremism, depicting minors in sexual situations (child sexual abuse material), depicting non-consensual sexual acts or sexual violence, or promoting or glorifying self-harm or suicide.

**Deceptive Content Controls:**
THE platform SHALL implement business rules that prohibit malicious software or links to malware, phishing attempts or fraudulent schemes, impersonation of individuals or organizations, and manipulated media presented as authentic without proper disclosure. WHEN automated systems detect such content, THE moderation queue SHALL prioritize it for immediate review by human moderators.

#### 1.2 Content Rating and Age Restrictions
WHEN users attempt to post content with mature themes including adult language, suggestive themes, violence, or controversial topics, THE platform SHALL require appropriate content labeling including NSFW (Not Safe For Work) tags for adult content, spoiler tags for plot-revealing content, trigger warnings for potentially distressing content, and age verification prompts for restricted communities.

WHILE users are creating content, THE system SHALL provide real-time warnings about content that MAY require these tags and SHALL prevent publishing until appropriate labels are applied. THE tagging system SHALL include community-specific requirements where certain communities have stricter content standards than platform-wide policies.

#### 1.3 Content Moderation Business Process

THE content policies SHALL be enforced through a multi-stage business process that ensures fairness while maintaining safety:

**Stage 1: User Reporting System**
WHEN a user encounters inappropriate content anywhere within communities, THE system SHALL provide one-click reporting functionality accessible from all content interfaces with anonymous reporting options to protect user privacy, category selection for report type with clear descriptions, ability to provide additional context up to 1000 characters, and immediate confirmation that their report has been submitted.

**Stage 2: Automated Screening**
WHEN content is reported or flagged by automated systems, THE moderation subsystem SHALL categorize it by severity level and assign it to appropriate review queues. High-priority content involving illegal activities or immediate safety concerns SHALL be escalated within 15 minutes to administrative review queues.

**Stage 3: Human Moderator Review**
THE platform SHALL maintain dedicated human moderator teams who SHALL review content based on business rules including: content must be reviewed within 24 hours for standard reports, within 4 hours for age-restricted content, within 2 hours for harassment reports, and within 1 hour for any content involving potential illegal activity or safety violations.

### 2. User Conduct Rules

#### 2.1 Community Standards for Behavior
THE platform SHALL enforce behavioral standards that promote respectful interaction across all communities while protecting users from harassment and discrimination. These standards SHALL apply to all forms of user interaction including posts, comments, private messages, and community management actions.

**Respectful Communication Standards:**
ALL users SHALL treat all community members with respect regardless of their views or backgrounds. WHEN disagreements occur, THE discussions SHALL focus on ideas rather than personal attacks, with constructive criticism encouraged over hostile responses. Every user SHALL have the right to express their opinions within policy boundaries without fear of harassment or intimidation.

THE platform SHALL provide business processes for handling communication violations including: warning system for minor offenses (inappropriate language, minor personal attacks), temporary restriction system for moderate offenses (persistent harassment, repeated rule violations), community-specific guidance tools for moderators, and escalation procedures for serious violations.

#### 3.1 Spam Detection Workflow
THE platform SHALL implement comprehensive spam prevention mechanisms that protect community discussions while allowing legitimate commercial content and self-promotion under clear guidelines.

**Automated Spam Detection Rules:**
THE system SHALL automatically flag content for review based on business rules including: pattern recognition for common spam behaviors such as repeated posting of similar content across multiple communities, rate limiting on posting and commenting activities to detect automated spam campaigns, content similarity detection to prevent repeated posting of identical content, link analysis to identify promotional content disguised as legitimate discussions, and machine learning models trained on historical spam data with regular model updates based on new spam patterns.

**New Account Restrictions:**
WHEN new accounts are created, THE platform SHALL automatically implement protective measures including waiting periods of 24-48 hours before allowing new post creation, limiting posting frequency until account credibility is established through positive karma, requiring email verification before full platform access, monitoring initial activities for spam indicators with automatic intervention if patterns emerge, and providing graduated access that increases as new users demonstrate positive community contributions.

**Graduated Response to Spam:**
WHERE an account is flagged for engaging in spam behavior, THE platform SHALL implement graduated responses: First offense results in manual review queue for all user content with notification about spam policy, Second offense triggers automatic reduction in posting privileges to prevent rapid-fire submissions, Third offense places all user content under additional moderation with escalating penalties for continued violations.

WHERE users modify privacy settings, THE system SHALL apply changes immediately to any new content or interactions while updating existing content based on user preferences with clear confirmation messages about what privacy changes mean for their historical information and maintaining detailed audit logs of privacy setting modifications for user security and legal compliance purposes.

### 5. Enforcement Actions with Clear Business Rules

#### 5.1 Progressive Discipline System Implementation
THE platform SHALL implement fair and transparent enforcement with progressive discipline that educates users about community standards while maintaining platform safety.

**Warning System Protocol:**
WHEN users commit first-time policy violations, THE platform SHALL provide educational warnings that clearly explain: what community rule was violated with specific references to the policy text, what behavior changes are required to avoid future enforcement, resources and guides for understanding community compliance, and a clear statement that future violations will result in escalating penalties.

**Suspension Implementation Rules:**
THE system SHALL implement multiple suspension types based on violation severity: Temporary posting bans lasting 24-72 hours for minor rule violations after warning, community-specific restrictions banning users from specific communities for 1-2 weeks for repeated violations in those areas, platform-wide feature restrictions limiting access to voting or commenting features for users with pattern violations, and temporary suspensions lasting 7-30 days for serious policy violations that don't warrant permanent action.

#### 5.2 Permanent Action Procedures Implementation
THE platform reserves permanent actions for the most severe violations or repeat serious offenders who demonstrate inability or unwillingness to comply with community standards. WHERE permanent actions are taken, THE platform SHALL provide comprehensive appeals processes that include clear timeline for appeals (typically 30 days), independent review by moderators/administrators not involved in original decision-making, multiple appeal levels available for complex cases with escalating review standards.

IF users appeal permanent actions, THE system SHALL provide detailed documentation showing the review history, include user rehabilitation opportunities for appropriate cases, establish clear expectations for restored privileges, and maintain transparent appeals process with accountability measures for all parties involved.
