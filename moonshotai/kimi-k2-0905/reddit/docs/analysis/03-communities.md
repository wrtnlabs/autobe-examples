# Reddit Communities (Subreddits) Requirements

## Executive Summary
This document defines the complete requirements for community (subreddit) functionality in the Reddit-like community platform. Communities serve as the foundational organizational units where users gather around shared interests, create content, and engage in discussions. The system must support community creation, moderation, customization, and discovery while maintaining quality standards and user engagement.

## 1. Community Creation Process

### 1.1 Community Foundation Requirements

THE system SHALL allow registered users to create new communities with unique names that are 3-21 characters long, containing only letters, numbers, and underscores, while preventing special characters, spaces, and reserved words.

WHEN a user creates a community, THE system SHALL require a community name, title, description, primary category, and community type (public, restricted, or private), then assign the creator as the head moderator with full administrative privileges.

WHILE creating a community, THE system SHALL validate that the name is not already taken within the platform, does not violate trademark or copyright restrictions, and adheres to naming conventions that prevent confusion with existing communities.

IF a community name is already taken or violates naming rules, THEN THE system SHALL provide clear error messages explaining the issue and suggest available alternatives based on the user's original request.

### 1.2 Community Setup Workflow

THE community creation process SHALL include initial configuration steps for setting community rules, posting guidelines, content restrictions, member requirements, and automated moderation tools to establish community standards from inception.

WHEN setting community rules, THE system SHALL allow moderators to create up to 10 custom rules with specific enforcement actions (warning, temporary restriction, permanent ban), display order, and severity levels that affect community member privileges.

THE system SHALL provide templates for common community rules covering spam prevention, content relevance, civility requirements, self-promotion guidelines, and topic-specific regulations to help new moderators establish appropriate standards quickly.

WHERE a community requires specific member criteria, THE system SHALL support setting minimum account age, minimum platform karma requirements, and email verification mandates to ensure quality participation from community members.

### 1.3 Community Classification System

THE system SHALL categorize communities into hierarchical topic trees including Arts, Business, Computers, Games, Health, Science, Society, Sports, Technology, and Travel with specific subcategories to improve content discovery and recommendation accuracy.

WHEN classifying communities, THE system SHALL allow multiple relevant categories while designating one primary category, enable community tags for specific topics, and support cross-community relationships for related-interest discovery.

THE community classification SHALL automatically suggest relevant categories based on the community name, description, and initial content, while allowing moderator override to ensure accurate categorization that matches community focus and member interests.

## 2. Community Moderation System

### 2.1 Moderator Hierarchy and Permissions

THE system SHALL establish a three-tier moderator structure: Head Moderator (full control), Senior Moderators (administrative privileges), and Junior Moderators (content moderation only) to distribute moderation responsibilities while maintaining accountability.

WHEN assigning moderator roles, THE head moderator SHALL control permission levels for post removal, user banning, rule creation, community settings modification, and new moderator invitations with granular permission settings for each moderator tier.

THE system SHALL maintain an audit log of all moderator actions including post removals, user bans, rule changes, and permission modifications with timestamps, justifications, and moderator identification to ensure transparency and accountability in community governance.

WHERE moderator disputes arise, THE system SHALL provide escalation mechanisms to senior moderators or platform administrators with documented resolution processes and the ability to review moderation history and decision justification.

### 2.2 Content Moderation Tools

THE moderation interface SHALL provide tools for reviewing reported content, automatically flagged posts, spam detection results, and trending content that requires immediate attention to maintain community standards efficiently.

WHEN moderating content, THE system SHALL allow moderators to remove posts, lock threads, pin announcements, mark content as spoiler or NSFW, flair posts appropriately, and provide removal reasons that educate users about community standards.

THE automated moderation SHALL include configurable filters for common spam patterns, banned keywords, excessive posting from single users, suspicious voting patterns, and content that violates platform-wide policies while allowing moderator review and override.

IF content is removed by automated systems, THEN THE system SHALL queue items for human moderator review within 24 hours, allow user appeals with justification, and provide statistics on automated moderation accuracy to improve filter performance.

### 2.3 User Management within Communities

THE system SHALL allow moderators to ban users temporarily (1-999 days) or permanently with justification logs, optional appeal processes, and graduated sanctions including warnings, temporary restrictions, and escalating ban durations for repeat violations.

WHEN banning users, THE system SHALL notify affected users with specific reason, duration, appeal instructions, and examples of violating content while maintaining privacy of reporting users and protecting against retaliation in other communities.

THE community user management SHALL support shadow banning (posts invisible to others), rate limiting for new users, approval requirements for posting, and member muting for temporary cooling-off periods while preserving community functionality for non-disruptive members.

THE system SHALL prevent banned users from viewing private community content, posting or commenting, voting on community posts, and using community-specific features while allowing them to participate in other communities without restriction.

## 3. Community Rules and Governance

### 3.1 Rule Creation and Enforcement

THE system SHALL allow communities to create custom rules with titles (up to 100 characters), descriptions (up to 500 characters), enforcement levels (warning, 24-hour restriction, 7-day ban, permanent ban), and display priority for organizing rules by importance and severity.

WHEN users violate community rules, THE system SHALL log violations, apply appropriate sanctions automatically based on enforcement levels, track user violation history, and escalate penalties for repeat offenders according to community-specific violation thresholds.

THE rule enforcement SHALL include graduated response systems where first violations receive warnings, subsequent violations trigger temporary restrictions, and severe or repeated violations result in longer bans with clear escalation timelines and rehabilitation opportunities for affected users.

WHERE users accumulate multiple violations across different rules, THE system SHALL aggregate violation severity, consider rule violation patterns, and potentially apply community-wide sanctions while allowing moderators to review and adjust automated enforcement decisions.

### 3.2 Democratic Governance Features

THE system SHALL support community polls for major decisions including rule changes, moderator additions/removals, community direction choices, and policy modifications with configurable voting periods and participation requirements to ensure democratic community governance.

WHEN conducting community polls, THE system SHALL provide transparent vote counting, prevent duplicate voting, allow discussion periods before voting, and require minimum participation thresholds to validate poll results as representing community consensus.

THE governance system SHALL include annual moderator elections where community members can vote for new moderators, challenge existing moderation teams, and propose governance structure changes with campaign periods, candidate statements, and transparent election results.

IF community members express significant dissatisfaction with moderation (through polls, reports, or coordinated action), THEN THE system SHALL provide intervention mechanisms including moderator recall elections, platform administrator mediation, and in extreme cases, complete moderation team replacement processes.

## 4. Community Themes and Customization
