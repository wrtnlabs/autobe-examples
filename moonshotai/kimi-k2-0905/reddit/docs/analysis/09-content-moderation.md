# Reddit Community Platform: Content Moderation Requirements

## Executive Summary

THE content moderation system SHALL maintain Reddit-like community platform standards through comprehensive content review processes, user reporting mechanisms, and automated filtering systems. THE system SHALL balance community self-governance with platform oversight to ensure safe, legal, and engaging user experiences while protecting user rights and community autonomy.

WHEN content moderation decisions occur, THE system SHALL provide transparent processes, clear communication with affected users, and fair appeal mechanisms that maintain community trust and platform integrity.

## Content Moderation Architecture Overview

THE platform SHALL implement a multi-layered approach to content moderation combining community-driven governance with platform-wide oversight. THE moderation system SHALL include user reporting mechanisms, automated content filters, role-based moderation tools, and administrative oversight capabilities.

THE content moderation workflow SHALL process content through automated screening, community reporting, human review processes, and policy enforcement while maintaining audit logs for quality assurance and regulatory compliance.

## Report Workflow System

### Report Submission Interface

THE system SHALL provide prominent reporting functionality on all posts, comments, and user profiles through a standardized "Report" button positioned in the user interface actions menu.

WHEN users click the report button, THE system SHALL present a categorized reporting form with predefined violation types including: harassment or hate speech, spam or misleading content, violence or threats, inappropriate NSFW content, copyright infringement, personal information sharing, impersonation, and community-specific rule violations.

THE report submission process SHALL require users to select a primary violation category and optionally provide additional context through a description field. WHEN users select "Community Rule Violations" or "Other Violations," THE system SHALL require minimum 30 characters of explanatory text to ensure adequate context for moderator review.

THE system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent report abuse by limiting users to maximum 20 reports per hour and maximum 100 reports per 24-hour period. WHERE users exceed these thresholds, THE system SHALL temporarily block additional reporting and log potential abuse patterns for administrator review.

### Report Prioritization Algorithm

THE system SHALL automatically prioritize reported content based on multiple factors: number of independent reports submitted on the same content, severity weights assigned to violation categories, user reputation scores of reporters and content creators, and content visibility metrics including engagement levels and community size.

WHILE processing reported content, THE algorithm SHALL assign priority scores: harassment or hate speech (high priority), illegal content (high priority), spam (medium priority), community guidelines violations (low priority). THE system SHALL elevate content that receives multiple reports within short time periods while reducing priority for reports from users with history of frivolous reporting.

THE report prioritization SHALL maintain separate queues for platform-wide violations, community-specific violations, and cross-community patterns requiring administrative intervention. WHERE content receives reports across multiple communities simultaneously, THE system SHALL flag for immediate administrative review and potential platform-wide action.

### Reporter Protection and Feedback

THE system SHALL maintain complete anonymity for users submitting reports by preventing content creators or other users from accessing reporter identities or reporting history. THE reporter identity SHALL be accessible only to administrators investigating false reporting patterns or harassment claims.

WHEN users submit reports, THE system SHALL provide immediate confirmation with report tracking IDs and estimated review timeframe. THE system SHALL send updates to reporters when their reported content receives moderation action, including summary of outcome and appreciation message for community participation.

THE protection mechanisms SHALL include safeguards against retaliation: automatic detection of suspicious activity targeting reporters, enhanced monitoring of interactions between reporters and reported users, escalation procedures for harassment claims, and support resources for users experiencing retaliation for legitimate reporting activities.

## Moderation Queue Management

### Role-Based Queue Assignment

THE moderation queue system SHALL segment access based on user roles and community relationships. Community moderators SHALL access only content from communities where they hold moderation privileges, while platform administrators SHALL access all content requiring review across the platform.

THE queue assignment algorithm SHALL consider: moderator permissions within specific communities, content visibility restrictions, violation type severity, and workload distribution among available moderators. WHERE moderators manage multiple communities, THE queue SHALL consolidate relevant content across all assigned communities into unified views.

THE system SHALL implement escalation rules: content with high priority scores escalate to senior moderators or administrators, cross-community violations automatically redirect to administrators, DMCA and legal concerns are flagged for immediate administrative review, and repeated violations by the same users escalate for enhanced monitoring.

### Queue Processing Workflow

THE moderation queue interface SHALL display reported content with comprehensive context including: original content with timestamp and user information, summary of violation allegations, number and type of reports received, community context and applicable rules, content history including edits or previous actions, and user history including previous violations or warnings.

WHILE moderators review content, THE system SHALL provide analytical tools: vote patterns and engagement metrics, related content submissions from the same user, similar content handling by other moderators, and community guidelines applicable to the reported violation.

THE queue processing SHALL enforce time-based service levels: high priority content reviewed within 4 hours, medium priority within 24 hours, and low priority within 72 hours. THE system SHALL automatically escalate overdue items and notify administrators of queue backlogs exceeding acceptable thresholds.

## Automated Content Moderation

### Machine Learning Content Analysis

THE automated moderation system SHALL implement machine learning algorithms trained on platform content to identify potential policy violations. THE algorithms SHALL analyze text content for harassment indicators, spam patterns, copyright violations, and inappropriate content while maintaining accuracy rates above 85% for automated removal actions.

THE content analysis SHALL include multiple detection dimensions: text pattern matching for prohibited terms, image recognition for inappropriate visual content, link analysis for malicious URLs, and behavior pattern detection for coordinated harassment campaigns. WHERE automated systems detect potential violations, THE system SHALL implement graduated response based on confidence levels.

THE automated moderation SHALL maintain separate confidence thresholds: 95% confidence level triggers immediate automated removal with notification, 80-94% confidence level flags content for priority human review while keeping visible, 70-79% confidence level adds content to standard moderation queue for review but remains visible, and below 70% confidence level relies solely on user reporting mechanisms.

### Content Pre-Posting Filters

THE automated system SHALL implement pre-posting content filters to prevent obvious policy violations from reaching public visibility. THE filters SHALL apply to new posts, comments, and community content with immediate feedback when content fails automated screening.

THE pre-posting filters SHALL include: text pattern recognition for prohibited terms, image recognition for inappropriate or copyrighted content, link validation against known malicious domains, and rate limiting to prevent spam posting patterns. WHERE content automatically flags, THE system SHALL inform users about policy violations with educational messages explaining corrective actions.

THE automated systems SHALL maintain false positive rates below 5% by implementing: human review queues for appealed decisions, machine learning model retraining based on human overrides, regular accuracy assessments, and community feedback integration for algorithm improvement.

## Ban and Suspension System

### Violation Severity Classification

THE system SHALL categorize violations into four severity levels with corresponding enforcement actions:

Level 1 - Minor Violations include first-time community guideline violations, minor spam behaviors, inappropriate content in wrong communities, and etiquette violations without harassment component. Level 1 violations result in educational warnings, automated content moderation flags, temporary posting restrictions (24-72 hours), and required user education modules before restored privileges.

Level 2 - Moderate Violations encompass repeated minor violations, harassment or uncivil behavior directed at individuals, community-specific rule violations, and promotional behaviors exceeding community limits. Level 2 enforcement includes community-specific temporary restrictions (3-7 days), enhanced human review of future content, probation period requirements, and detailed policy education notifications.

Level 3 - Serious Violations cover harassment or hate speech targeting individuals or groups, repeated community rule violations despite warnings, copyright violations or intellectual property infringements, and coordinated harassment campaigns. Level 3 violations trigger immediate content removal, extended banning periods (1-4 weeks), enhanced monitoring of user activity, and administrative review requirements for privilege restoration.

Level 4 - Severe Violations involve illegal content including threats, violence, or prohibited substances, child exploitation or abuse content, coordinated harassment campaigns targeting protected groups, or repeated serious violations despite previous sanctions. Level 4 violations result in immediate permanent removal from specific communities or platform-wide, legal reporting where applicable, enhanced cooperation with law enforcement when required, and cooperation with other platforms for user information sharing.

### Progressive Discipline Framework

THE enforcement system SHALL implement progressive discipline where users generally advance through warning stages before severe restrictions are applied. WHEN users commit initial Level 1 or 2 violations, THE system provides educational feedback, temporary restrictions, and opportunities for behavior modification before escalating enforcement.

THE progressive discipline SHALL track violation history: minor violations expire from user records after 6 months without subsequent offenses, moderate violations expire after 1 year with demonstrated improvement, serious violations remain visible to moderators for 2 years, and severe violations permanently remain on administrative records for safety purposes.

WHERE users demonstrate sustained positive behavior following violations, THE system SHALL provide rehabilitation pathways including early probation termination, privilege restoration after educational completion, clear criteria for removing restrictions, and opportunities for community participation once standards are met.

## Appeal and Review Processes

### Appeal Submission Requirements

THE system SHALL provide systematic appeal mechanisms for all moderation actions affecting user privileges or content availability. WHEN users receive moderation actions, THE system SHALL include clear appeal instructions, applicable timeframes, and direct links to appeal submission interfaces.

THE appeal submission process SHALL require: identification of the specific moderation action being appealed, detailed explanation of why the moderation decision was incorrect, relevant evidence supporting the appeal position, acknowledgment of appeal limitations and process rules, and confirmation of understanding regarding appeal outcome finality.

THE appeal submission SHALL maintain: anonymity of appellants during review when safety concerns exist, tracking systems for appeal status monitoring, automatic notifications of appeal milestones, privacy protections for all parties involved in appeal processes, and integration with administrative oversight systems for quality assurance.

### Multi-Level Review Hierarchy

THE appeal review process SHALL implement multi-level review hierarchy ensuring impartial evaluation: initial review by administrators not involved in original moderation, second-level review by senior administrators for complex cases, community governance councils for appeals involving community rule interpretations, and final administrative boards for serious violations or legal concerns.

THE multi-level review SHALL maintain strict timeframes: initial appeal review completion within 72 hours for standard cases, enhanced review within 7 days for complex or multi-community violations, expedited review within 24 hours for urgent safety concerns, and final decisions within 14 days with clear communication to appellants.

THE review hierarchy SHALL provide independence from original moderation decisions through: rotating review assignments, blind review of appeal details when appropriate, statistical analysis of appeal success rates, regular review of moderator consistency, and administrative oversight of moderator performance metrics.

## Cross-Community Moderation Coordination

### User Behavior Tracking

THE system SHALL maintain comprehensive user behavior tracking across communities to identify patterns of policy violations, harassment campaigns, and community policy evasion. THE tracking system SHALL aggregate: violation history across all communities, patterns of inappropriate content creation across multiple communities, timing and coordination of policy violations, and community responses to user behavior modifications.

THE behavior tracking SHALL support moderator coordination: shared reports on users who violate policies across multiple communities, early warning systems for developing harassment patterns, coordination tools for handling users who avoid community bans by moving to new communities, and statistical analysis of user behavior modification following enforcement actions.

WHERE cross-community patterns emerge, THE system SHALL flag for administrative intervention: users engaging in harassment campaigns across multiple communities, coordination of policy violations among groups of users, attempts to circumvent community-specific bans by moving between communities, and community rule violations that impact platform-wide user safety or wellbeing.

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance

THE content moderation system SHALL maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations including: Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown procedures, privacy protection requirements under GDPR and similar regulations, content reporting requirements for illegal activities, cooperation protocols with law enforcement agencies, and minor protection requirements under children's safety legislation.

THE compliance framework SHALL include: formal DMCA notice and counter-notice processes with designated agents, privacy impact assessments for moderation actions, content retention policies for legal proceedings, international data transfer compliance for global users, and regular legal review of policies and enforcement procedures.

THE system SHALL maintain legal documentation: content audit logs preserved for legal proceedings, user information handling in compliance with privacy laws, cross-border enforcement coordination where required, and cooperation protocols for investigations by regulatory authorities.
