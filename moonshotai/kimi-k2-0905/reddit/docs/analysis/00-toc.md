## Development Approach

This documentation follows a **business-first** approach, focusing on **what** the system should do rather than **how** to implement it. Each document provides:

- **Clear, unambiguous business requirements** written in natural language
- **EARS-formatted requirements** for critical system behaviors
- **User-centered design** emphasizing user stories and workflows
- **Specific, measurable requirements** developers can implement directly
- **Comprehensive coverage** of edge cases and business rules
- **Developer autonomy** with full implementation freedom

## Getting Started

Begin your development journey with the [Service Overview](./01-service-overview.md) document to understand our business vision and strategic positioning. Then proceed through the documents in logical order as they build upon each other to create a complete, cohesive community platform.

> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**. All technical implementations (architecture, APIs, database design, etc.) are at the discretion of the development team.*
