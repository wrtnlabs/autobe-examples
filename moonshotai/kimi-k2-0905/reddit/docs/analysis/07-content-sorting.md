# Content Sorting and Algorithm Requirements

## Introduction and Overview

THE content sorting system SHALL serve as the primary mechanism for content discovery and user engagement on the Reddit-like community platform. THE system SHALL balance content freshness, community engagement, and user preferences to maximize platform participation while ensuring diverse representation across communities of all sizes.

WHEN users browse communities or personal feeds, THE system SHALL provide multiple sorting options that accommodate different consumption patterns. THE algorithms SHALL prevent large communities from dominating discovery while ensuring quality content from smaller communities remains visible and discoverable.

## Core Sorting Algorithms

### Hot Algorithm - Primary Discovery Mechanism

WHEN users select "hot" sorting, THE system SHALL calculate content popularity using engagement metrics, content age, and community-specific factors. THE hot score SHALL represent the relative "temperature" of content based on how quickly it receives positive engagement after being posted.

THE hot algorithm calculation SHALL combine multiple factors into a single ranking score. Each post SHALL receive proportional value based on: net votes (upvotes minus downvotes) weighted at standard value, comments counting as 0.5 engagement units toward popularity, time decay reducing score as content ages, and community size normalization ensuring fair representation across communities of different sizes.

WHILE content is less than 2 hours old, THE system SHALL apply a freshness bonus multiplier of 1.2 to encourage discovery of new content. WHEN content receives rapid engagement within the first hour of posting, THE system SHALL increase visibility by applying additional ranking bonuses proportionate to the engagement velocity.

THE hot algorithm SHALL prevent domination by large communities through normalization processes. THE system SHALL calculate engagement rates relative to community subscriber counts rather than absolute numbers. THIS approach ensures that content from smaller communities with high engagement rates can compete fairly with content from larger communities that may have more total engagement but lower engagement rates.

### Top Algorithm - Quality Content Recognition

WHEN users select "top" sorting, THE system SHALL rank content purely by net engagement within specified time periods. THE top algorithm SHALL provide five distinct time-based views: "today" showing highest scoring content from the past 24 hours, "this week" highlighting the most popular content from the past 7 days, "this month" featuring quality content from the past 30 days, "this year" showcasing the best content from the past 365 days, and "all time" displaying the highest rated content in platform history.

THE top scoring calculation SHALL use simple net score methodology where posts with higher upvote ratios receive preference over controversial content with similar total votes. THE algorithm SHALL subtract downvotes from upvotes to calculate final scores, exclude content with negative net scores from rankings, and provide clear time period selection options for user control.

WHERE communities have specific content patterns, such as discussion-focused communities versus link-sharing communities, THE system SHALL adjust top calculations to account for different types of engagement appropriately. Discussion communities may value comment volume more heavily, while link-sharing communities focus on voting patterns.

### New Algorithm - Chronological Discovery

THE new sorting algorithm SHALL display content in strict reverse chronological order with the newest posts appearing first, regardless of engagement metrics or popularity scores. THIS approach provides equal visibility opportunities for all new content and ensures users can discover fresh discussions and breaking news quickly.

THE new algorithm implementation SHALL maintain precise chronological ordering within time windows, batch posts made within the same minute through randomization to prevent automated posting advantages, display posting timestamps with appropriate granularity (hours for recent posts, days for older content, years for archival content), and maintain consistent ordering during user browsing sessions to prevent confusion from reordering.

WHERE users subscribe to high-frequency communities that post many new items daily, THE system SHALL provide filtering options to manage content volume effectively while maintaining new content discovery as the primary focus.

### Controversial Algorithm - Polarizing Content Identification

THE controversial algorithm SHALL identify and surface content that generates significant disagreement within the community while maintaining high overall engagement. THIS algorithm helps users discover discussions that spark debate and may be of high community interest despite having mixed reception.

THE controversial score calculation SHALL combine multiple indicators: high total vote counts with balanced upvotes and downvotes, elevated comment-to-vote ratios suggesting discussion generation, mixed sentiment patterns in associated comments, and sustained engagement over time rather than brief spikes of activity.

THE controversial ranking formula SHALL normalize content across different communities and time periods by using relative engagement rates rather than absolute numbers. THIS approach identifies genuinely polarizing content while preventing the algorithm from simply showing content with low engagement but high disagreement.

WHILE content appears in controversial rankings, THE system SHALL monitor for organized manipulation attempts such as brigading or coordinated voting campaigns. IF such patterns are detected, THE system SHALL adjust controversial scores appropriately or remove content from controversial rankings until human review can verify legitimate controversy versus artificial manipulation.

## User Filtering and Feed Customization

### User Preference Management

THE system SHALL provide comprehensive user controls for customizing content discovery experiences. USERS SHALL have the ability to set default sorting preferences for different sections of the platform, configure time period filters for top content, enable or disable specific content types, and customize display density preferences.

THE preference system SHALL maintain user settings persistently across sessions and devices, synchronize settings across web and mobile applications, allow quick switching between sorting modes without navigating to settings pages, and provide "reset to defaults" options for users who want to return to platform-recommended configurations.

WHERE users have specific content preferences, such as avoiding certain topics or preferring specific content formats, THE system SHALL accommodate these preferences through sophisticated filtering mechanisms while still providing diverse content discovery opportunities.

### Feed Personalization Mechanics

THE personalized feed SHALL combine user subscription preferences with engagement history to create individually relevant content streams. WHEN generating personalized feeds, THE system SHALL analyze individual voting patterns to identify content preferences, consider reading time and engagement depth as quality indicators, account for community subscription patterns and subscription frequency, and incorporate explicit preference settings users have configured.

THE personalization algorithm SHALL avoid creating "filter bubbles" that limit users to narrow content ranges by ensuring minimum diversity in recommendations, occasionally surfacing content from less-engaged communities, providing user controls to adjust personalization strength, and maintaining chronological diversity to prevent over-focusing on any specific time period.

### Algorithm Performance Requirements

THE sorting algorithms SHALL process requests within strict performance limits to ensure responsive user experiences. HOMEPAGE loading SHALL complete within 800 milliseconds including full feed generation, community listings SHALL render within 1.2 seconds with populated content, voting operations SHALL process within 500 milliseconds including ranking updates, and profile pages SHALL display within 1 second with activity history.

THE algorithm SHALL handle scale efficiently supporting minimum 10,000 concurrent active users without performance degradation, processing 1,000+ simultaneous content operations with graceful queue management, maintaining responsive performance under peak traffic conditions like major news events, and scaling resources automatically based on demand patterns.

### Quality Assurance and Monitoring

THE system SHALL continuously monitor algorithm performance and fairness through comprehensive metrics tracking. THE monitoring SHALL include engagement rate analysis across different communities and user segments, diversity metrics ensuring representation across various community types, algorithm response time monitoring with alerts for degradation, and accuracy verification comparing algorithmic decisions with user feedback and reported content quality.

THE quality assurance process SHALL implement regular audits of algorithm fairness and effectiveness, testing edge cases with extremely high or low engagement content, validating bias detection across different community sizes and topics, maintaining documentation of algorithm parameter changes with business justification, and providing rollback capabilities within 15 minutes if algorithm changes cause unexpected issues.

### User Transparency and Controls

THE platform SHALL provide users with meaningful control over their content experience while maintaining algorithmic fairness across the system. USERS SHALL have ability to disable personalized feed algorithms entirely if desired, provide feedback on content recommendations to improve personalization accuracy, access explanations of why specific content appears in their feeds, and customize the weighting between real-time and personalized content discovery.

THE transparency system SHALL clearly indicate when algorithms are influencing content selection, provide explanations that help users understand their content discovery options, maintain consistent user experience when algorithm personalization is disabled, and protect user privacy while providing algorithmic content discovery services.
