# User Profiles Requirements

## Executive Summary

THE user profile system SHALL serve as the central identity and reputation management system for the Reddit-like community platform. THE system SHALL balance transparency with user privacy, enable personal expression through customization options, and provide comprehensive activity tracking while maintaining security boundaries between public and private information.

WHEN users interact with profiles, THE system SHALL provide immediate access to relevant information based on role-based permissions while protecting sensitive data through configurable privacy controls. THE profile system SHALL scale to support millions of users while maintaining performance standards and data integrity.

## Profile Information Architecture

### Public Profile Data Requirements

THE public profile SHALL display essential user information that builds trust and community engagement while maintaining appropriate privacy boundaries. WHEN viewing any user's profile, THE system SHALL present the following public information:

**Core Identity Information**
THE profile SHALL prominently display the username as the primary identifier with the complete URL format `/u/{username}`. THE username SHALL be displayed with proper formatting, capitalization as originally entered, and clear distinction from display names or community titles.

THE account creation date SHALL be displayed with both absolute date format (DD Month YYYY) and relative timeframe (e.g., "3 years ago") to help users quickly understand account maturity. THE account age SHALL automatically update the relative display as time passes.

THE system SHALL provide user avatar display with fallback options including uploaded images, default avatars from a curated collection, generated avatars based on username hash patterns, or social media avatars if social login integrations are enabled.

**Reputation and Activity Metrics**  
THE profile SHALL display total post karma and comment karma as separate metrics to show different types of community contribution. WHEN displaying karma, THE system SHALL use appropriate formatting for large numbers (e.g., "12.5k" for 12,500) while maintaining exact figures in tooltips or detailed views.

THE community subscription count SHALL indicate how many communities the user actively participates in. THE system SHALL update this count in real-time as users join or leave communities while respecting privacy settings that may hide specific subscription details.

THE system SHALL display the most active community based on recent posting and commenting activity, providing context about the user's primary interests and engagement patterns within the platform ecosystem.
