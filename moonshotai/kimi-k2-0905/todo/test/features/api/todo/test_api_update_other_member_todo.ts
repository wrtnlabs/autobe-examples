/**
 * Test attempting to update todos owned by other members.
 *
 * This test validates access control mechanisms by ensuring that authenticated
 * members can only update their own todos and receive authorization errors when
 * attempting to modify todos owned by other users. The test verifies proper
 * data isolation between member accounts to maintain privacy and security
 * boundaries.
 *
 * The test creates two separate member accounts, creates a todo for the first
 * member, then attempts to update that same todo from the second member's
 * account. This cross-access attempt should fail with appropriate error
 * handling, demonstrating that the system enforces ownership-based access
 * controls.
