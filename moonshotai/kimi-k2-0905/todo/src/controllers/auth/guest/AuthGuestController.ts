   * Guest registration endpoint for creating temporary browsing sessions.
   *
   * Guest registration endpoint that creates temporary guest accounts for
   * viewing demonstration todos and exploring application functionality. This
   * operation generates a unique session identifier for tracking guest browsing
   * activity and creates session metadata for managing demonstration content
   * access. Guest users can only view sample todos and have read-only access to
   * understand the application's core features before registering as members.
   *
   * The guest registration process requires no personal information - only
   * automatic session tracking for demonstration purposes. Guests can browse
   * existing public todos to understand how the application works without
   * creating an account or providing contact details. This provides
   * frictionless exploration of the todo management features while maintaining
   * clear separation between demonstration content and personal user todos.
   *
   * Guest sessions are tracked for basic activity monitoring and demonstration
   * content delivery. The system automatically generates session identifiers
   * and timestamps for managing the guest browsing experience. All guest
   * activities are limited to read-only access of demonstration content - no
   * todo creation, modification, or personal data collection occurs during
   * guest usage.

  /**
   * Guest session refresh for extending demonstration access.
   *
   * Guest session refresh endpoint that extends temporary browsing sessions for
   * continued access to demonstration todos. This operation validates the
   * current guest session identifier and renews session timestamps to maintain
   * continuity in the guest browsing experience. Guest users can continue
   * exploring the application functionality without interruption while their
   * demonstration session remains active.
   *
   * The session refresh mechanism ensures that guest users maintain continuous
   * access to view sample todos and understand application features without
   * being unexpectedly logged out. The operation updates the guest's last
   * activity timestamp and extends their browsing session for reasonable time
   * periods. This provides a smooth exploration experience while the system
   * tracks session activity for demonstration content management.
   *
   * Guest session refresh supports the discovery phase where users evaluate the
   * todo application before deciding to register as members. The system
   * maintains session consistency and prevents unauthorized extension of guest
   * privileges beyond the intended demonstration scope. All session renewals
   * remain within the bounds of read-only access to public demonstration
   * content.
