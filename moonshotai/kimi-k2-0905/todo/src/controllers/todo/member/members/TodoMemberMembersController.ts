   * within the system. It supports advanced filtering based on account status,
   * creation date ranges, and activity patterns. The results are paginated to
   * handle large member populations efficiently.
   *
   * The operation includes search functionality using full-text search on
   * member identifiers, allowing members to find specific member accounts if
   * they have the necessary permissions. It supports sorting by various
   * parameters including creation date, last login, and email address to
   * facilitate member discovery.
   *
   * Pagination ensures the system can handle large numbers of members
   * efficiently, with configurable page sizes for optimal performance. The
   * response includes both the current page of members and metadata about the
   * total results, current pagination position, and available sorting options.
   *
   * Security measures ensure that sensitive member data is appropriately
   * handled and only authorized users can access member lists based on their
   * role and permissions. The system maintains member privacy by only exposing
   * necessary information for legitimate purposes.

   * The implementation handles member self-service profile updates with
   * appropriate validation rules for email format, role permissions, and

   *
   * Business logic includes validation of update permissions based on member
   * authentication state, ensuring users can only modify their own profiles
