   * (1-200 characters), description length if provided (up to 1000 characters),
   * and ensures due dates are in the future when specified. Priority levels are
   * validated against the accepted values (Low, Medium, High) with a default of
   * Medium when not provided.

   * trigram indexes, filtering by completion status (active/completed),
   * priority level (Low/Medium/High), and sorting by creation date, priority,
   * or completion status.
   *
   * The operation provides efficient pagination support for managing large todo
   * lists, with configurable page sizes and cursor-based pagination to maintain
   * consistent performance. Search results are returned as summary data

   * completion status, priority, and key timestamps without exposing sensitive
   * details.
   *
   * Security considerations include mandatory member authentication to ensure
   * users can only access their personal todo items. The operation implements
   * rate limiting to prevent abuse while maintaining responsive performance for
   * legitimate usage. The response format is optimized for mobile applications
   * with minimal payload sizes while preserving all necessary data for complete
   * functionality.
   *
   * The todo_todos table from the Prisma schema defines the data structure with
   * fields including title (up to 500 characters), completion status, priority
   * levels, creation and modification timestamps, and completion timestamps.
   * The operation leverages indexed queries for optimal performance across the
   * member_id and completed status fields.
