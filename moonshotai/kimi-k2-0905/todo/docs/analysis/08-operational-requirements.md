THE system SHALL support data import from exported files with validation to prevent corruption. THE export/import process SHALL complete within 10 seconds for typical usage patterns of up to 1,000 todo items.

THE backup strategy SHALL implement incremental backup techniques to minimize storage overhead. WHEN changes occur, THE system SHALL backup only modified data to reduce backup time by 85%. THE recovery mechanism SHALL restore from backups within 2 minutes while preserving data integrity through checksum validation.

### Data Integrity and Validation
THE system SHALL validate all todo data before storage operations using comprehensive validation rules.

THE system SHALL maintain referential integrity between related todo items when applicable through foreign key constraints.

THE data validation process SHALL include business rule verification and format consistency checks.

THE validation SHALL occur within 100 milliseconds to maintain application responsiveness.

### Storage Performance Optimization
WHERE caching is implemented, THE system SHALL maintain frequently accessed todo items in memory cache with automatic eviction after 15 minutes of inactivity. THE cache SHALL support LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy to optimize memory usage. WHEN cache misses occur, THE system SHALL fetch data within 500 milliseconds from persistent storage.

THE storage optimization SHALL implement intelligent indexing strategies for todo query operations. WHEN users filter or search todos, THE system SHALL utilize indexes to improve query performance by up to 90%. THE storage layer SHALL automatically maintain index statistics for optimal query execution plans.

## System Maintenance and Updates

### Update Management and Deployment
THE system SHALL support hot updates without losing current todo data or requiring user logout. WHEN updates are applied, THE system SHALL migrate existing data automatically using migration scripts. THE update process SHALL preserve all user settings, preferences, and custom configurations.

THE deployment strategy SHALL implement blue-green deployment techniques to minimize downtime. WHEN deploying updates, THE system SHALL maintain service availability above 99.9% throughout the deployment process. THE rollback mechanism SHALL restore previous version within 2 minutes if deployment failures occur.

### Cleanup Operations and Housekeeping
THE system SHALL periodically clean up temporary files, cache data, and browser storage every 24 hours. WHEN cleanup operations execute, THE system SHALL preserve all active todo items, user preferences, and essential application data. THE cleanup process SHALL not impact system responsiveness for users by running during low-activity periods.

THE housekeeping system SHALL monitor and manage storage quotas automatically. WHEN storage approaches 90% capacity, THE system SHALL alert users and suggest cleanup strategies. THE cleanup recommendations SHALL prioritize removal of large temporary files while preserving user-critical todo data.

### Performance Monitoring and Optimization
THE system SHALL continuously monitor performance metrics including response times, memory usage, and storage efficiency. WHEN performance degradation is detected, THE system SHALL attempt automatic optimization through caching strategies and resource reallocation. THE optimization process SHALL run during periods of low activity to maintain user experience quality.

THE performance optimization SHALL implement intelligent resource scaling based on usage patterns. WHEN system load increases, THE system SHALL automatically allocate additional resources to maintain response time requirements. THE monitoring system SHALL generate performance reports weekly to identify optimization opportunities.

## Failure Recovery and Business Continuity

### Comprehensive Failure Recovery
IF system failure occurs during todo operations, THEN THE system SHALL prevent data loss through automatic saving mechanisms with automatic retry every 3 seconds. THE system SHALL maintain operation logs for recovery purposes with detailed transaction history. WHEN recovery is necessary, THE system SHALL restore to the most recent consistent state within 30 seconds of failure detection.

THE failure recovery mechanism SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures. WHEN a service becomes unavailable, THE circuit breaker SHALL trip within 60 seconds and prevent further requests. THE recovery process SHALL attempt service restoration with exponentially increasing retry intervals from 1 second to 5 minutes.

### Network Failure Resilience

THE system SHALL detect network restoration within 5 seconds and resume normal operation.

### Storage Failure Management and Recovery
IF storage becomes corrupted, THEN THE system SHALL attempt recovery using stored checksums and parity information. WHEN recovery using built-in mechanisms fails, THEN THE system SHALL notify users through appropriate error messages and provide options for data restoration from backup sources. THE system SHALL prevent further write operations until storage integrity is confirmed to prevent data loss.

THE disaster recovery testing SHALL include scenarios for complete system loss with recovery from backup systems.

THE business continuity plan SHALL define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 15 minutes for worst-case scenarios.

THE recovery testing shall occur during scheduled maintenance windows with advance notification to users.

## Monitoring and Alerting Requirements

WHEN usage exceeds reasonable limits (100 operations per minute), THE system shall throttle requests and notify administrators. THE monitoring SHALL generate alerts when usage patterns indicate potential security threats or system abuse.

### Comprehensive Error Logging and Analysis
THE system SHALL log all system errors with detailed context information including timestamp, operation type, error codes, and relevant debugging information. WHEN errors occur during user operations, THE system SHALL provide appropriate user-friendly error messages while maintaining detailed logs for support purposes. THE logging level SHALL be configurable from debug to error-only based on operational requirements.

THE error analysis system SHALL implement intelligent categorization of error types for faster resolution. WHEN similar errors occur repeatedly, THE system shall group them and identify common root causes.
