# Security and Privacy Requirements

## Data Protection Principles

### Core Privacy Philosophy
THE Todo list application SHALL protect user privacy by implementing minimal data collection, local-first data handling, and user control over their information. THE system SHALL collect only essential data needed for core todo functionality and SHALL NOT transmit personal information to external services or remote servers.

### Data Minimization Approach
THE application SHALL follow strict data minimization principles by collecting only information necessary for basic todo functionality. THE system SHALL store todo content, completion status, and timestamps locally on the user's device without requiring account registration or personal identification information that could compromise privacy.

### Local-First Architecture
WHEN users create or modify todo items, THE system SHALL store data locally in the browser's localStorage or equivalent client-side storage mechanism. THE application SHALL NOT transmit todo data to remote servers, external APIs, or cloud services, ensuring complete user privacy and control over their personal task lists.

### Transparency Requirements
THE system SHALL provide clear information about what data is collected, how it's stored locally, and ways users can control or delete their information. THE application SHALL display a prominent privacy notice informing users that their todo data remains on their device unless they specifically choose to export or share it through explicit actions.

## User Privacy Rights

### Right to Complete Control
USERS SHALL have complete control over their todo data, including the ability to view, modify, export, or delete all locally stored information at any time. THE system SHALL provide easy access to these controls through the application settings menu with clear explanations of each function.

### Right to Immediate Deletion
WHEN users request deletion of their data, THE system SHALL immediately remove all locally stored todo items, user preferences, and any associated metadata from the device. THE application SHALL provide a clearly labeled "Clear All Data" function that permanently deletes all storage contents with appropriate confirmation.

### Right to Data Export
THE system SHALL allow users to export their complete todo data in standard formats including JSON and CSV for backup or migration to other applications. THIS export feature SHALL ensure users maintain ownership and control over their information even when transitioning to different todo management solutions.

### Right to Anonymous Usage
THE application SHALL NOT require users to provide personal information such as name, email address, or phone number to use basic todo functionality. THE system SHALL allow completely anonymous usage while ensuring all todo data remains private to the user's device without external visibility.

## Data Retention Policies

### Local Storage Retention
ALL todo data SHALL remain stored locally on the user's device indefinitely unless explicitly deleted by the user through provided deletion mechanisms. THE system SHALL NOT implement automatic data deletion, retention time limits, or expiration policies, allowing users to maintain long-term access to their todo lists.

### Browser Data Persistence Expectations
THE application SHALL leverage browser localStorage APIs to persist todo data between browser sessions and device restarts. THE system SHALL expect data to remain available as long as users do not clear browser data or switch to different browser profiles or installations.

### Data Migration Capabilities
WHEN users need to transfer their todo data to different devices or browsers, THE system SHALL provide export functionality that creates portable data files transferable through secure channels. THIS ensures users maintain continuous access to their information across device changes or browser migrations.

### Account-Free Operation
THE application SHALL support complete functionality without user accounts, email registration, or online authentication, eliminating the need for personally identifiable information storage or centralized user profiling systems.

## Security Requirements

### Local Storage Security Implementation
THE system SHALL implement secure coding practices when using browser storage APIs to prevent common vulnerabilities including cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. THE application SHALL sanitize all stored data to prevent malicious script execution from todo item content or user inputs.

### Data Integrity Protection
WHEN storing or retrieving todo data, THE system SHALL implement validation checks to ensure data integrity and prevent corruption of locally stored information. THE application SHALL handle storage quota limits gracefully by informing users when available storage becomes full.

### Input Validation Requirements
ALL user inputs for todo creation and editing SHALL be validated and sanitized to prevent injection of malicious code or scripts that could compromise the local storage mechanism or user experience. THE system SHALL strip potentially dangerous characters while preserving user content intent.

### Browser Security Compliance
THE application SHALL operate strictly within standard browser security policies and SHALL NOT attempt to access file systems, external APIs beyond web storage, or other device resources outside standard browser APIs necessary for localStorage functionality.

## Compliance Obligations

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Principles
THE Todo list application SHALL comply with GDPR principles by providing user control over personal data, implementing privacy by design principles, enabling data portability, and supporting user rights to access and permanently delete their information upon request.

### Privacy by Design Implementation
THE system SHALL implement privacy protection as a core design principle integrated throughout all functionality rather than as an optional feature or afterthought. All system components SHALL consider user privacy impact and data protection requirements during implementation.

### Cross-Border Data Transfer Prevention
SINCE the application operates entirely through local browser storage, THE system SHALL NOT transfer user data across borders or to servers in different jurisdictions, eliminating complex international data protection compliance requirements and regulatory complexity.

### User Education Requirements
THE application SHALL provide clear, accessible information about privacy practices, local data storage location, and user rights to control their information. This education SHALL appear prominently during first-time user engagement and remain accessible throughout usage.

## Privacy Policy Requirements

### Policy Accessibility Standards
THE Todo list application SHALL provide easy access to a comprehensive privacy policy explaining data collection practices, storage methods, user rights, and contact information for privacy inquiries. THE policy SHALL be accessible from every screen of the application through consistent navigation elements.

### Policy Content Specifications
THE privacy policy SHALL explain that data is stored locally, no personal information is required for basic functionality, data is not shared with third parties, and users maintain complete control over their information. THE policy SHALL clearly state users can delete or export their data at any time without restrictions.

### Policy Update Management
IF privacy practices change in future versions of the application, THE system SHALL inform users of any changes and require acceptance of updated privacy terms before allowing continued usage. THE policy SHALL maintain a public revision history informing users about historical changes over time.

### Multi-language Accessibility
WHERE the application supports multiple languages, THE privacy policy SHALL be available in all supported languages to ensure users understand their privacy rights regardless of language preference or technical background.

## Data Security Measures

### Browser Storage Protection
THE application SHALL encourage users to keep their browsers and operating systems updated to maintain the security of local storage mechanisms. THE system SHALL operate within security-sandboxed browser environments to prevent unauthorized external access to stored data.

### Secure Default Configuration
THE application SHALL implement secure defaults by providing reasonable limits on storage space usage, validating input lengths, and preventing abuse of local storage capabilities that could lead to performance issues or security vulnerabilities.

### Session Management Security
WHEN users close their browser or application tab, THE system SHALL maintain persistent access to stored todo data during subsequent browser sessions unless users have specifically cleared browser data or disabled local storage for the application domain.

### Error Handling Security
THE application SHALL handle storage errors and exceptions without exposing sensitive information, preventing error messages that could reveal application structure, data storage details, or other potentially exploitable technical information to potential attackers.

## User Control Rights

### Informed Consent Process
THE system SHALL obtain meaningful user consent through continued usage after privacy policy review and clear explanation that data remains solely on their device and is not transmitted elsewhere. THE application SHALL not proceed with functionality until storage consent is granted by the browser environment.

### Right to Rectify and Modify
USERS SHALL have immediate ability to edit, modify, or correct any information in their todo lists through the application interface without restrictions or delays. THE system SHALL support comprehensive real-time editing of all data elements through intuitive user interface components.

### Right to Processing Restrictions
SINCE the application operates locally without external processing, USERS SHALL maintain complete control over their data without requiring complex restriction mechanisms. Users SHALL control all aspects of data processing by managing their local browser storage configuration.

### Right to Object and Opt-Out
THE application SHALL respect user decisions to object to data processing by providing clear options to disable or uninstall the application, remove all stored data permanently, or export information before termination of usage with proper user authorization.
