# Todo List Application Data Models Specification

This document defines the conceptual data structures and business relationships for a minimal Todo list application. It focuses on the business logic and user-experience aspects without specifying technical implementation details.

## User Data Concepts

### User Account Properties

The system manages two types of users distinguished by their access capabilities:

**Guest User Concept**
THE guest user represents an unauthenticated visitor who can only view public demonstration todos. WHEN a guest accesses the system, THE system SHALL NOT create any persistent user records. THE guest user SHALL only be able to browse sample todo items to understand the application's functionality. WHILE in guest mode, THE system SHALL prevent any data modification operations.

**Member User Concept**
THE member user represents an authenticated user with full personal todo management capabilities. WHEN a user registers for membership, THE system SHALL require a unique email address and password. THE member account SHALL persist even after logout, retaining all personal todo data. WHILE logged in, THE member user SHALL have exclusive access to their personal todo collections.

### User Authentication Requirements

WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL validate the email format and ensure email uniqueness. IF the email already exists, THEN the system SHALL prevent registration and display appropriate message. THE registration process SHALL require both email and password confirmation. WHERE a user forgets their password, THE system SHALL provide secure password reset functionality via email verification.

WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL verify the email and password combination within 2 seconds. IF authentication fails after 5 attempts, THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes. WHILE a user session is active, THE system SHALL maintain security through automatic token refresh. THE login session SHALL expire after 30 days of inactivity for security purposes.

## Todo Item Data Structure

### Core Todo Properties

THE fundamental data unit is the todo item, which contains essential information for task management. THE todo item SHALL include:

1. **Title**: THE primary task description using natural language. IF no title is provided, THEN THE system SHALL prevent todo creation. THE title SHALL support up to 200 characters to accommodate detailed task descriptions. THE title SHALL NOT contain profanity or inappropriate content.

2. **Completion Status**: THE boolean indicator showing whether the task is complete. WHEN a todo is created, THE completion status SHALL default to false. WHEN marked complete, THE completion status SHALL change to true. THE system SHALL track completion timestamp for each status change.

3. **Creation Timestamp**: THE record of when the todo item was created. THE timestamp SHALL be automatically set by the system upon creation. THE creation time SHALL never be editable, even when other properties are modified.

4. **Last Modified Timestamp**: THE record of when the todo item was last changed. THE timestamp SHALL update automatically whenever any property is modified. THE system SHALL preserve the modification history for audit purposes.

5. **Unique Identifier**: THE system-generated unique code for each todo item. THE identifier SHALL be unique across all user accounts worldwide. THE identifier SHALL remain constant throughout the todo's lifecycle. THE system SHALL use the identifier for all internal reference purposes.

### Optional Todo Properties

WHERE additional organization is desired, THE system SHALL support optional properties:

**Priority Level**: THE categorization indicator for task urgency. THE priority SHALL support three levels: "High", "Medium", and "Low". WHEN not specified, THE priority SHALL default to "Medium". THE user SHALL be able to change priority at any time during the todo's lifetime.

**Description**: THE detailed text field providing additional task context. THE description SHALL support up to 1,000 characters for comprehensive task explanation. THE description SHALL support basic text formatting including line breaks. THE user SHALL be able to add or modify description without affecting other properties.

**Due Date**: THE target completion date for the todo item. WHERE a due date is set, THE system SHALL provide visual indication when the date approaches. THE due date SHALL support any future date but prevent past dates. IF the current date passes due date, THE system SHALL mark the todo as overdue.

**Category**: THE organizational label for grouping related todos. THE user SHALL be able to create custom category names. THE system SHALL allow multiple todos to share the same category. THE user SHALL be able to filter todos by category.

## List Organization Concepts

### Personal Collection Management

THE system organizes todos into private personal collections for each member. THE personal collection SHALL belong exclusively to one member user. THE collection size SHALL support unlimited todos without artificial limitations. WHEN a user creates a todo, THE system SHALL automatically add it to their personal collection.

THE personal collection SHALL support organization through categories, priority levels, and completion status. WHERE categories are implemented, THE system SHALL group todos by category for visual organization. THE user SHALL be able to sort todos by completion status, creation date, or due date. THE system SHALL provide visual separation between completed and active todos.

### List Display Preferences

WHILE viewing their collection, THE user SHALL control display preferences. THE system SHALL support list view with todos displayed one below another. THE system SHALL support compact view with multiple todos per row. WHEN in list view, THE system SHALL show complete todo properties. WHERE compact view is selected, THE system SHALL show essential information only.

THE user SHALL be able to filter the list by completion status, showing all items, active items only, or completed items only. THE filtering SHALL occur instantly to provide immediate visual feedback. THE total count of displayed items SHALL be visible above the list.

### Search and Discovery

WHERE search functionality is implemented, THE system SHALL search within both title and description fields. THE search results SHALL appear instantly as the user types. THE search feature SHALL be case-insensitive for user convenience. THE system SHALL highlight matching text within search results. WHERE no results match, THE system SHALL display helpful message with suggestions.

## Data Relationships Business Logic

### User-Todo Ownership

THE fundamental relationship connects member users to their personal todo items. THE relationship SHALL follow strict one-to-many pattern where each todo belongs to exactly one user. WHERE a todo exists, THE system SHALL ensure an owner user exists. WHEN a user deletes their account, THE system SHALL remove all associated todos. THE system SHALL prevent unauthorized access to private user todos.

THE ownership relationship SHALL persist across all operations. WHEN a user modifies their todos, THE system SHALL ensure modifications only affect that user's data. THE system SHALL never allow one user to view or modify another user's todo items. WHERE user data is exported, THE system SHALL only include the requesting user's personal collection.

### Todo State Transitions

THE todo lifecycle includes several key state transitions managed through business logic rules. WHEN a todo is created, THE status automatically becomes "Active" and the creation timestamp is set. WHILE a todo remains active, THE user SHALL be able to edit title, description, and properties without restrictions on the number of changes.

WHEN a user marks a todo complete, THE status transitions to "Complete" and the completion timestamp is recorded. THE visual display SHALL change immediately to indicate the completion status. THE system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the transition between states through immediate interface updates.

WHILE a todo is completed, THE user SHALL be able to revert the status back to active through the same interaction mechanism. THE system SHALL preserve the completion history regardless of reversal operations. IF a user reverts completion multiple times, THE system SHALL maintain accurate final status while recording all state changes for audit purposes.

### Data Integrity Rules

THE system SHALL maintain data integrity through several business rules. THE user SHALL NOT be able to modify creation timestamp after initial creation, ensuring immutable audit trails. THE todo identifier SHALL remain constant throughout the lifecycle regardless of property changes. THE last modified timestamp SHALL update automatically with any property change without user intervention.

WHERE priority levels exist, THE system SHALL validate they follow approved values during all modification operations. THE title SHALL meet minimum length requirements before accepting any creation or modification attempt. THE description SHALL pass appropriate filters while preserving user intent and expression freedom. THE due date SHALL be in the future if provided, with clear indication when the date becomes past due.

THE category system SHALL allow users to organize multiple todos under shared organizational principles. THE category name SHALL be unique for each user account, preventing confusion within personal collections. WHEN categories are used, THE system SHALL provide filtering capabilities to display related todos as grouped collections.

### Error Handling Business Logic

WHEN validation fails during any operation, THE system SHALL provide specific error messages identifying the exact problem encountered. IF a user attempts to save invalid data, THEN THE system SHALL prevent the save operation while preserving all entered information. The error messages SHALL explain how to correct the issue for successful completion while maintaining professional tone and constructive guidance.

THE system SHALL handle concurrent operations gracefully when users interact quickly with the interface. WHEN multiple operations occur simultaneously, THE system SHALL queue them appropriately and resolve conflicts using timestamp precedence. IF operation conflicts arise, THEN users receive clear notification explaining the resolution and providing options for manual adjustment.

### Performance Expectations for Data Operations

WHEN users interact with their todo lists, THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 300 milliseconds for local browser operations. The list updates SHALL appear instantly after completing actions like marking complete, providing satisfying user experience through immediate response. THE search results SHALL display as quickly as users type, supporting dynamic filtering and discovery workflows.

THE filter applications SHALL complete without noticeable delay regardless of list size up to maximum capacity. THE overall user experience SHALL feel responsive and immediate throughout all operations while maintaining data security and integrity boundaries. THE system SHALL balance responsiveness with error checking to prevent accidental data corruption during fast workflows.

### Minimalist Design Constraints

THE data model SHALL support the minimal functional requirements without unnecessary complexity or extraneous business objects. While the optional properties extend functionality, THE core model focuses on essential task management capabilities that most users need daily. THE system SHALL provide complete functionality even without implementing optional features, ensuring backward compatibility with simpler implementations.

THE business rules SHALL ensure data consistency while remaining simple enough for immediate implementation without complex frameworks or extensive interpretation required. THE relationships SHALL be self-explanatory through clear object lifecycles and ownership principles that align with natural user expectations about personal data management.
