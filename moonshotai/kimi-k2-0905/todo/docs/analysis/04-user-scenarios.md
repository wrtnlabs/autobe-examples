# User Scenarios and Complete Workflows - Todo List Application

## Guest User Experience and Discovery

### Initial Guest Access Flow
WHEN an unauthenticated guest visits the Todo List application, THE system SHALL display public demonstration todos to illustrate basic functionality. The guest experience SHALL allow browsing of sample tasks without any registration requirement, providing immediate understanding of the application's core value proposition.

THE guest user SHALL encounter a prominent call-to-action explaining the benefits of creating a personal account. The system SHALL distinguish clearly between public demo content and private user functionality through visual indicators and messaging. THE guest interface SHALL provide direct access to account creation while maintaining an unobtrusive browsing experience.

IF a guest attempts to perform member-only actions like creating todos, THE system SHALL redirect to the registration page with a clear explanation that personal accounts enable full functionality. THE guest session SHALL maintain browsing preferences without the need for cookie acknowledgment or additional permissions.

### Guest-to-Member Conversion
WHEN a guest decides to create an account, THE system SHALL provide a streamlined registration process requesting minimal information (email and password only). THE registration form SHALL validate input immediately, preventing common errors through real-time feedback and format checking.

THE conversion process SHALL complete within 30 seconds, automatically logging in the new member and transferring any preferences set during the guest session. THE new member SHALL receive immediate access to all functionality previously demonstrated during their guest experience.

## Account Registration and Authentication

### Member Registration Process
THE registration workflow SHALL be designed for users with limited technical experience, requiring only essential information while maintaining security standards. WHEN a user provides their email address, THE system SHALL validate format correctness and immediately check for existing accounts to prevent confusion.

THE password creation process SHALL be clearly explained with visual indicators showing strength requirements (minimum 8 characters with mixed case and numbers). THE system SHALL provide contextual help for users struggling with password creation requirements without being overly restrictive or complex.

IF registration succeeds, THE new member SHALL be automatically authenticated and redirected to an empty personal dashboard. THE onboarding experience SHALL include helpful walkthrough of the core features without requiring skip options, as the interface is designed for immediate usability.

### Authentication Session Management
WHEN a member logs in, THE system SHALL create a session token valid for 30 days to balance security with user convenience. THE authentication process SHALL complete within 2 seconds, providing immediate feedback about successful authentication without unnecessary confirmation screens.

THE system SHALL provide "Remember Me" functionality when logging in from trusted devices, storing local credentials in browser storage with appropriate encryption. WHEN members access the application from unrecognized devices, THE system SHALL require re-authentication and notify the user of the new access.

IF authentication fails after 5 consecutive attempts, THEN the account SHALL be temporarily locked for 15 minutes, with clear user notification explaining the security measure and providing alternative recovery options through email verification.

## First Todo Creation Experience

### Creating Initial Todo Items
WHEN a new member first accesses their personal dashboard, THE system SHALL present an inviting empty state with clear guidance for creating the first todo. THE interface SHALL suggest common examples like "Buy groceries", "Call dentist", or "Pay bills" to help users understand what constitutes appropriate todo content.

THE creation process SHALL be optimized for quick entry with a single text field and optional advanced settings. WHEN users type a todo description, THE system SHALL accept up to 500 characters for comprehensive task descriptions while maintaining simple interaction patterns. THE initial todo SHALL immediately appear in the personal list upon submission.

### Expanding Todo Functionality
ONCE a member has created their first todo, THE system SHALL reveal additional organizational options including priority levels (high, medium, low) with clear visual indicators for each level. THE due date functionality SHALL include a calendar picker designed for mobile and desktop use, preventing invalid dates through proper validation.

THE tagging system, if implemented, SHALL utilize an auto-complete mechanism that suggests existing tags from the user's collection, promoting consistency while preventing tag proliferation. THE member SHALL be able to add multiple tags simultaneously with keyboard shortcuts for efficient organization.

## Complete Todo Management Workflows

### Daily Todo Review Patterns
THE primary user workflow involves morning review of existing todos to plan daily activities. THE system SHALL load the todo list instantaneously (<1 second) for lists containing up to 100 items, ensuring users spend time on task planning rather than waiting for interface loading.

THE display SHALL default to showing all todos with completed items visually distinguished (strikethrough text and reduced opacity). THE member SHALL have persistent preference options for default viewing modes including hiding completed tasks, sorting by priority, or grouping by categories.

### Todo Status Management
WHILE managing tasks throughout the day, THE member SHALL routinely mark items as complete as they finish work. THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback when clicking the completion checkbox, with smooth animations that provide satisfying confirmation without slowing the user experience.

THE completion action SHALL be reversible through an undo mechanism available for 5 seconds after completion, allowing recovery from accidental toggling. THE system SHALL automatically update completion timestamps and statistics for personal accountability tracking.

### Advanced Organization Features
FOR members with large todo collections, THE search functionality SHALL provide instant results filtered by matching text within titles and descriptions. THE search interface SHALL be consistently visible for quick access and support both keyboard and mouse navigation efficiently.

THE filtering system SHALL offer preset options including "Active Todos" (incomplete), "Completed Today", and "Overdue Items" using intuitive selection controls that understand the context of due dates and completion times.

## Error Handling User Scenarios

### Creation Error Recovery
IF a member attempts to create a todo title longer than the 200-character limit, THEN THE system SHALL provide clear feedback with character counting and gracefully prevent submission with explanation of the limitation boundary.

WHEN invalid characters or malicious content is detected during todo creation or editing, THEN THE system SHALL automatically sanitize the input while preserving user intent, maintaining functionality without disrupting the workflow with security warnings.

IF storage becomes unavailable during todo operations, THEN THE system SHALL preserve the current input state and provide retry functionality when storage access is restored. THE failed operation SHALL be marked unobtrusively to allow the member to continue working while background recovery occurs.

### Authentication and Session Errors
IF a member's authentication session expires during active workflow, THEN THE system SHALL preserve the current work state and redirect to login with clear notifications about the expired session. Upon successful re-authentication, THE system SHALL restore the member to their previous activity location without data loss.

## Cross-Device Synchronization Scenarios

### Multi-Device Access Patterns
DURING typical usage, THE member will access their todo list from multiple devices including smartphone, tablet, and desktop computers. THE synchronization SHALL occur automatically when network connectivity is available, ensuring consistency across all devices without manual intervention.

THE system SHALL handle the common scenario where the member adds a todo on a mobile device while commuting, then needs to access the updated collection from their workplace computer. THE synchronization SHALL complete within 2 seconds when connectivity is restored.

### Offline Usage Continuity
WHEN network connectivity is intermittently unavailable, THE offline-first design SHALL allow complete functionality for creating, editing, and completing todos locally. THE system SHALL queue all changes in local storage and automatically synchronize when connectivity is restored without requiring member action.

IF multiple devices make modifications while offline, THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent conflict resolution using modification timestamps to determine the most recent changes. THE member SHALL be notified of any conflicts and provided simple options for resolution.

## Extended Daily Usage Patterns

### Productivity Workflow Integration
MOST members integrate todo management into their personal productivity systems with regular morning reviews and end-of-day planning sessions. THE system SHALL support this pattern by providing flexible viewing modes for both quick daily scanning and thorough weekly planning reviews.

THE interface design SHALL accommodate both brief interactions (adding a quick item while in line at a store) and thoughtful planning sessions (organizing complex tasks with detailed descriptions, due dates, and priorities). THE user experience SHALL feel seamless regardless of the engagement depth or time constraints.

### Habit Formation Support
FOR members seeking to establish consistent task management habits, THE system SHALL provide gentle encouragement through progress visualization without gamification elements that could distract from genuine productivity. THE completion history and statistics provide intrinsic motivation through visible accomplishment tracking.

THE system SHALL support various completion styles including immediate marking upon finishing tasks, batch completion at day's end, or periodic review and cleanup sessions. THE interface adapts smoothly regardless of the member's preferred organizational methodology or time management system.
