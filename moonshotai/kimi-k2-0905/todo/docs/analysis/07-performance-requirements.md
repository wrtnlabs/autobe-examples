# Performance Requirements Specification

## Overview

This document establishes the performance requirements for the minimal Todo list application, ensuring responsive user experience while maintaining simplicity and efficiency for basic todo management operations.

## User Experience Expectations

### Instant Response Philosophy
THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for all user interactions, with operations completing within human perception thresholds to maintain flow state during task management activities.

### Smooth Interactions
WHEN users interact with todo items, THE interface SHALL respond instantly without perceptible delays, supporting natural workflow continuity for productivity-focused users managing daily tasks.

## Response Time Requirements

### Create Operations
WHEN a user creates a new todo item, THE system SHALL complete the operation and display the new item in the list within 200 milliseconds under normal conditions.

### Read Operations  
WHEN loading the todo list, THE system SHALL display all existing todo items within 500 milliseconds for lists containing up to 100 items.

### Update Operations
WHEN a user marks a todo item as complete or incomplete, THE system SHALL update the visual state within 100 milliseconds and persist the change within 1 second.

### Delete Operations
WHEN a user deletes a todo item, THE system SHALL remove the item from display within 150 milliseconds and complete deletion processing within 1 second.

### Edit Operations
WHEN a user edits todo item text, THE system SHALL save changes and update the display within 300 milliseconds after the user finishes editing.

## Storage Limitations

### Todo Item Capacity
THE system SHALL support at least 1,000 todo items per user list while maintaining optimal performance characteristics defined in the response time requirements.

### Text Length Constraints
THE system SHALL limit todo item text to 500 characters to ensure efficient storage processing and maintain performance consistency across operations.

### Data Size Expectations
WHILE maintaining the todo list, THE complete user dataset SHALL consume no more than 1MB of storage space for typical usage patterns of up to 1,000 todo items.

### Browser Local Storage  
WHERE the application uses browser local storage, THE system SHALL limit total storage usage to 5MB per user to ensure compatibility with standard browser limitations.

## Concurrent User Support

### Single User Optimization  
THE system SHALL be optimized for single-user scenarios where one user manages their personal todo list without interference from other users.

### Local Operation Priority
THE application SHALL prioritize local operations and updates over synchronization requirements, ensuring immediate responsiveness for the primary user.

### Conflict Resolution
IF multiple browser tabs or windows access the same todo list, THEN THE system SHALL maintain consistency using simple last-write-wins conflict resolution within 1 second.

## Device Compatibility Performance

### Mobile Device Support
THE system SHALL maintain full functionality and meet response time requirements on mobile devices including smartphones and tablets.

### Network Independence
THE application SHALL provide complete functionality offline with local storage, meeting all response time requirements without network latency.

### Memory Efficiency
THE system SHALL operate efficiently within 100MB of RAM usage for typical todo management activities on standard devices.

### Processing Power Adaptation
THE application SHALL adjust smoothly across devices with varying processing capabilities, maintaining core functionality on minimum specifications.

## Performance Testing Criteria

### Load Testing Requirements
THE system SHALL maintain response time requirements when handling burst operations including creating 10 todo items within 5 seconds.

### Stress Testing Boundaries
THE application SHALL gracefully handle the upper limits of capacity (1,000 todo items) without crashing or becoming unresponsive.

### Edge Case Performance
WHEN approaching storage limits, THE system SHALL provide clear user feedback and maintain functionality for essential operations.

### Browser Compatibility
THE system SHALL maintain consistent performance across modern web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge within the last two versions.

## Scalability Considerations

### User Growth Preparation
THE architecture SHALL allow for future enhancement to support multiple users without fundamental restructuring of core performance logic.

### Feature Expansion Readiness
WHERE additional features are added later, THE system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing performance characteristics for current functionality.

### Data Migration Efficiency
IF storage requirements change, THEN THE system SHALL provide efficient migration mechanisms to maintain performance during data conversion operations.

## Error Handling Performance

### Graceful Degradation
IF performance requirements cannot be met due to system constraints, THEN THE application SHALL gracefully degrade functionality while maintaining core todo management capabilities.

### Timeout Specifications
WHEN operations exceed normal response times, THE system SHALL implement appropriate timeouts: 5 seconds for user operations, 30 seconds for data processing.

### Error Recovery Speed
THE system SHALL recover from performance failures within 3 seconds and restore normal operation without data loss.

## Success Criteria

### User Experience Metrics
- 95% of user interactions complete within defined response time thresholds
- Zero user-visible crashes during normal operation
- Immediate feedback provided for all user actions

### Technical Performance Goals  
- Memory usage stays below defined limits under normal usage patterns
- Storage efficiency maintains consistent performance at maximum capacity
- Offline operation provides identical performance to online states

### Business Impact Targets
- User task completion time minimized through responsive interface
- Data reliability maintained through efficient storage and retrieval operations
- Long-term maintainability ensured through performance-conscious architecture

This minimal approach ensures optimal performance for the current scope while maintaining flexibility for future growth and enhancement opportunities.
