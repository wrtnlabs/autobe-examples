# Functional Requirements for Todo List Application

## Overview

This document specifies the functional requirements for a minimal todo list application that provides essential task management capabilities. The application prioritizes simplicity and immediate usability, allowing users to manage their daily tasks without complexity or learning curve.

## Todo Item Properties

### Core Todo Attributes

THE todo item SHALL have the following business properties:

**Title** (Required)
- THE title SHALL be a text description of the task
- THE title SHALL have a maximum length of 200 characters
- THE title SHALL not be empty or contain only whitespace
- WHEN a user enters a title, THE system SHALL trim leading and trailing whitespace

**Description** (Optional)
- THE description SHALL provide additional details about the task
- THE description SHALL support up to 1,000 characters
- WHEN a description is not provided, THE system SHALL store the todo without a description

**Completion Status**
- THE completion status SHALL indicate whether the task is finished
- THE completion status SHALL default to "incomplete" when a todo is created
- THE completion status SHALL be visually distinct between complete and incomplete states

**Creation Timestamp**
- THE creation timestamp SHALL record when the todo was created
- THE creation timestamp SHALL be automatically set by the system
- THE creation timestamp SHALL not be editable by users

**Last Modified Timestamp**
- THE last modified timestamp SHALL record the most recent change to the todo
- THE last modified timestamp SHALL be automatically updated when any property changes
- THE last modified timestamp SHALL not be directly editable by users

### Optional Properties

**Due Date** (Optional)
- THE due date SHALL specify when the task should be completed
- WHEN a due date is provided, THE system SHALL validate it is not in the past
- THE due date SHALL be formatted in a user-friendly manner
- THE due date SHALL be optional and can be added or removed at any time

**Priority Level** (Optional)
- THE priority level SHALL indicate the importance of the task
- THE priority level SHALL support three levels: "Low", "Medium", and "High"
- THE priority level SHALL default to "Medium" when not specified
- THE priority level SHALL be changeable at any time

**Tags/Labels** (Optional)
- THE tags SHALL help categorize and organize todos
- THE tags SHALL support multiple labels per todo item
- THE tags SHALL be plain text with a maximum of 50 characters each
- THE system SHALL support a reasonable number of tags per todo (recommended: 5-10)

## Create Todo

### User Workflow

WHEN a user wants to create a new todo, THE system SHALL provide a simple creation interface that requires minimal input.

**Minimal Creation Process**
- THE system SHALL allow todo creation with only a title
- WHEN only a title is provided, THE system SHALL create the todo with default values for other fields
- THE creation process SHALL complete within 2 seconds
- THE new todo SHALL appear immediately in the user's todo list

**Full Creation Process**
- THE system SHALL optionally allow users to specify description, due date, priority, and tags during creation
- WHEN additional fields are provided, THE system SHALL validate all inputs before creation
- THE system SHALL display clear validation messages for any invalid inputs
- THE todo SHALL be created only after all validation passes

### Business Rules for Creation

**Title Validation**
- IF a user attempts to create a todo without a title, THEN THE system SHALL display an error message indicating that title is required
- IF a user enters a title longer than 200 characters, THEN THE system SHALL truncate the title or display a length error
- IF a user enters only whitespace characters for the title, THEN THE system SHALL reject the todo and prompt for a valid title

**Description Validation**
- IF a user provides a description longer than 1,000 characters, THEN THE system SHALL display a character count error
- THE system SHALL inform users how many characters remain before reaching the limit

**Due Date Validation**
- IF a user sets a due date in the past, THEN THE system SHALL display an error explaining that due dates must be in the future
- THE system SHALL not prevent todo creation if due date validation fails - users can correct the date and retry

**Tag Validation**
- IF a user attempts to add more than the maximum allowed tags, THEN THE system SHALL display an error indicating the limit
- IF a user enters a tag longer than 50 characters, THEN THE system SHALL display a length error

### Creation Success Feedback

WHEN a todo is successfully created, THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
- THE newly created todo SHALL appear at the top of the todo list
- THE system MAY display a brief success message or visual indicator
- THE creation form SHALL be cleared and ready for the next todo
