# Performance and Scalability Requirements for Discussion Board System

## Executive Summary

The discussion board system must deliver responsive user experiences that encourage active participation while supporting sustainable growth from initial launch through established community status. Performance requirements are driven by user experience expectations, community engagement needs, and business growth targets. This document defines specific, measurable performance targets that guide architecture and implementation decisions.

The system is designed for a general audience interested in economics and political discussions. Performance expectations reflect a growing community platform that prioritizes responsiveness for core discussion activities while scaling efficiently to support thousands of concurrent users and millions of total discussions over time.

---

## 1. Performance Expectations and User Experience Philosophy

### 1.1 Core User Experience Objectives

THE system SHALL provide immediate, responsive feedback for all user interactions to encourage participation and maintain user engagement in discussions.

WHEN a user performs any action on the platform, THE system SHALL respond within timeframes that feel instant to the user, maintaining a sense of fluidity and responsiveness in the discussion experience.

THE system SHALL categorize user interaction responsiveness into the following performance tiers:
- **Tier 1 - Instant (< 500 ms)**: Voting, liking content, basic navigation between cached pages
- **Tier 2 - Quick (500 ms - 2 seconds)**: Discussion browsing, category navigation, initial page loads
- **Tier 3 - Responsive (2-5 seconds)**: Content creation, comment posting, complex searches
- **Tier 4 - Background (5-30 seconds)**: Analytics calculations, email sending, large data exports

### 1.2 Performance Principles

**Perceived Performance**: THE system SHALL prioritize perceived performance by providing immediate visual feedback (loading indicators, button state changes, progress bars) even when background processing continues.

**Progressive Enhancement**: THE system SHALL load initial critical content first, then progressively load supplementary content (thumbnails, user avatars, vote counts).

**Asynchronous Processing**: THE system SHALL use asynchronous/background processing for non-critical operations to prevent blocking user-facing requests.

**Caching Strategy**: THE system SHALL implement multi-level caching (browser cache, CDN, application cache, database query cache) to minimize response times for frequently accessed content.

## 2. Response Time Requirements

### 2.1 Discussion Browsing and Navigation

#### Homepage and Category Views

WHEN a user navigates to the discussion board homepage, THE system SHALL load and display the page with initial discussion list within 1.0 second on 95th percentile (p95) response time.

WHEN a user accesses a discussion category page, THE system SHALL load and display paginated discussion list (20-30 topics) within 1.5 seconds (p95).

WHEN a user loads the next page of discussions through pagination, THE system SHALL display the subsequent discussion list within 1.5 seconds (p95).

THE system SHALL achieve the following response time distribution for category page loads:
- Median (p50): 400-600 milliseconds
- 95th percentile (p95): ≤ 1.5 seconds
- 99th percentile (p99): ≤ 3.0 seconds
- Maximum acceptable (p99.9): ≤ 5.0 seconds

#### Discussion Topic Opening

WHEN a user opens a specific discussion topic, THE system SHALL load and display:
- Discussion title, author, category, and creation date: within 200 milliseconds
- Original discussion content and first batch of 10-20 comments: within 2.0 seconds (p95)
- Comment threading structure and vote counts: within 2.5 seconds (p95)

THE system SHALL implement lazy-loading to display the initial comment batch immediately while additional comments load in the background.

WHILE a user scrolls through comments, THE system SHALL load additional comments before the user reaches the end of the current visible batch (within 3-5 seconds of reaching bottom).

#### Search Results Display

WHEN a user performs a keyword search with typical query terms, THE system SHALL return and display results within 2.0 seconds (p95).

WHEN a user performs a filtered search (category + date range + author), THE system SHALL return results within 3.5 seconds (p95).

WHERE the search query includes complex filters or large result sets, THE system SHALL return results within 5.0 seconds (p95).

IF a search query exceeds the 5-second timeout, THE system SHALL display a message "Search taking longer than expected" with option to refine query or continue waiting.

## 7. Scalability Architecture Considerations

### 7.1 Horizontal Scalability

THE system architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling by:
- Deploying multiple application server instances behind load balancer
- Using stateless application design (no session data stored on individual servers)
- Implementing session storage in distributed cache (Redis, Memcached)
- Scaling database through read replicas and sharding

### 7.2 Caching Strategy

THE system SHALL implement multi-level caching:

**Browser Cache** (Browser):
- Static assets (CSS, JS, images): Cache for 30 days
- Dynamic API responses: Cache based on content type (5 minutes for lists, 1 minute for individual items)

**CDN Cache** (Edge):
- Profile images and static content: Cache for 7 days
- Discussion pages: Cache for 1 minute (to balance freshness and performance)

**Application Cache** (Redis/Memcached):
- Recently accessed discussions: Cache for 5 minutes
- User profiles and settings: Cache for 10 minutes
- Category list: Cache for 1 hour
- Search results: Cache for 2 minutes

**Database Query Cache**:
- Frequently executed queries cached at database layer
- Cache invalidated on relevant data updates

### 7.3 Database Optimization

THE system SHALL implement:
- Proper indexing on all frequently queried columns
- Query optimization and execution plan analysis
- Database connection pooling
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and improve performance
- Scheduled maintenance (VACUUM, ANALYZE, index rebuilding)

### 7.4 Load Balancing

THE system SHALL use load balancer configured with:
- **Algorithm**: Least connections or weighted round-robin
- **Health checks**: Every 10 seconds on backend servers
- **Failover**: Automatic removal of unhealthy servers, restoration when healthy
- **Session persistence**: Sticky sessions or distributed session store
- **SSL/TLS termination**: Load balancer handles HTTPS, internal communication in HTTP

---

## 8. Cost and Performance Trade-offs

### 8.1 Optimization Priorities

Performance optimization efforts SHALL prioritize in this order:
1. **Critical user paths**: Discussion viewing, commenting, voting (highest priority)
2. **User experience**: Page load time, interaction responsiveness (high priority)
3. **Search and discovery**: Search performance, category browsing (medium priority)
4. **Administrative functions**: Moderation, analytics (lower priority)
5. **Cost optimization**: Infrastructure efficiency (ongoing, non-blocking)

### 8.2 Cost-Performance Balance

THE system SHALL balance performance targets with infrastructure costs:
- Core discussion features optimized for performance regardless of cost
- Secondary features (analytics, advanced search) optimized for cost where acceptable
- Peak load capacity sized for 150% of expected load (cost-effective headroom)
- Archive strategy reduces ongoing storage costs for old content

---

## Summary

This document defines comprehensive performance and scalability requirements ensuring the discussion board system delivers responsive user experiences while growing sustainably from initial launch through maturity. All targets are specific, measurable, and achievable through architectural design and optimization strategies. The system prioritizes user experience for core discussion features while implementing cost-effective scaling for growth scenarios.

Performance targets evolve with system maturity: Year 1 focuses on delivering baseline performance, Year 2-3 emphasize scalability as community grows, and Year 5+ maintains performance efficiency at larger scale through optimization and archival strategies.
