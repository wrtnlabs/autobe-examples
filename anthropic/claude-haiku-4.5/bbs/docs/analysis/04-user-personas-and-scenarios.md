# User Personas and Scenarios

## Overview

This document presents detailed user personas and realistic usage scenarios for the Economic and Political Discussion Board. These personas represent the typical users who will interact with the system, their motivations, goals, pain points, and common workflows. Understanding these personas helps the development team build features that directly address user needs and behaviors.

The personas are based on the four user roles in the system: Guest, Member, Moderator, and Administrator. For each persona, we provide background context, primary goals, frustrations, technical comfort level, and typical interaction patterns. Each persona is supported by multiple realistic scenarios demonstrating their key workflows.

    - Sends an email to "PoliticalWarrior" with the warning
    - Logs the moderator action (Jennifer Patel, timestamp, reason, action taken)
    - Does NOT delete the comment (first offense, educational approach)
14. She optionally posts a public moderator comment in the thread: "Reminder: Let's keep discussions focused on the ideas, not the people. Personal attacks are against our guidelines."
15. THE system displays the moderator comment with special "Moderator" badge
16. She marks the report as "Resolved"
17. She continues monitoring the discussion for continued violations
18. "PoliticalWarrior" reads the warning, reflects, and adjusts his commenting style in subsequent responses

### Scenario 5: David Reviews Platform Metrics and Makes Growth Decisions

**Context**: David wants to understand platform growth, user engagement patterns, and make decisions about resource allocation and feature priorities.

**Primary Goal**: Review analytics and make data-driven decisions about platform management and growth

**Workflow Steps**:

1. David logs into his administrator dashboard
2. He reviews key metrics displayed on the dashboard:
   - Monthly Active Users (MAU): 12,500 (up 15% from last month = growth rate of ~1,600 new users)
   - Daily Active Users (DAU): 4,200 (maintaining 33% of MAU, healthy retention)
   - New discussions created: 340 this month (average 11 per day)
   - Average discussion length: 18 comments (healthy engagement depth)
   - User retention rate: 68% (68% of users active in at least 2 of last 3 months = strong retention)
3. He checks category performance metrics:
   - "Economic Policy": 45% of all discussions (highest engagement category)
   - "International Trade": 22%
   - "Political Systems": 18%
   - "Other": 15%
4. He reviews moderation metrics:
   - Flagged content this month: 47 items (down from 63 last month, indicating improving community health)
   - Average response time: 4.2 hours (within target of < 6 hours)
   - User appeals: 3 items (all resolved fairly)
   - Repeat violator rate: 2% (users receiving multiple violations within 30 days)
5. He notices Economic Policy discussions increased 25% from last month:
   - Analysis: Recent news about central bank policy changes drove interest
   - Decision point: Should he create subcategories under Economic Policy?
6. He reviews top contributors:
   - Marcus Johnson: 127 discussion-starter posts, 89% upvote rate (very high quality contributor)
   - Another user: 45 comments, 76% upvote rate
   - Sarah Chen: 23 comments in 2 months (strong engagement progression for new user)
7. He analyzes platform growth projections:
   - Current: 12,500 MAU, should reach 20,000 MAU in 6 months at current 15%/month growth rate
   - Infrastructure will support 25,000 MAU before requiring scaling
   - Current moderation team (6 moderators) handles load effectively at this scale
8. Based on analysis, he makes strategic decisions:
   - Create subcategories: "Fiscal Policy", "Monetary Policy", "International Economics" under "Economic Policy"
   - Invite Marcus Johnson to become a moderator for new "Economic Policy" subcategories
   - Plan for 2 additional moderators to be recruited within 3 months to handle growth to 20,000 MAU
   - Allocate budget for infrastructure upgrades starting in month 4
9. He documents these decisions and communicates them to the moderator team in a monthly meeting
10. He sets up follow-up reviews for:
   - Marcus's moderation performance in 30 days
   - Platform metrics in 30 days to track growth trajectory
    - Subcategory engagement metrics in 60 days to assess whether category reorganization was effective

**Outcome**: Data-driven decisions improve platform organization and support sustainable growth with appropriate moderation resources. The platform maintains quality while scaling efficiently.

**System Requirements Identified**:
- WHEN an administrator views the analytics dashboard, THE system SHALL calculate and display MAU, DAU, growth rate, and retention metrics
- WHEN an administrator reviews category metrics, THE system SHALL show distribution of discussions by category and engagement levels
- WHEN an administrator reviews moderation metrics, THE system SHALL display flag volume, response times, and appeal rates
- WHEN an administrator analyzes user contributions, THE system SHALL identify top contributors with upvote rates and participation metrics
- WHEN an administrator creates new categories, THE system SHALL allow category name, description, and optional subcategories
- WHEN an administrator assigns a moderator to a category, THE system SHALL restrict that moderator's actions to their assigned categories
- WHEN an administrator generates reports, THE system SHALL support export to CSV or PDF format for sharing with stakeholders
- THE system SHALL provide real-time dashboard updates reflecting current metrics without requiring page refresh

## User Interaction Patterns

### Peak Usage Times

Based on typical discussion board behavior:

- **Weekday Mornings (8 AM - 10 AM)**: Professionals checking platform during work hours; moderate activity (~15% of daily traffic)
- **Weekday Evenings (6 PM - 10 PM)**: Primary peak; people discussing after work; highest engagement (~40% of daily traffic)
- **Weekends (10 AM - 8 PM)**: Steady activity; people with more leisurely time for detailed discussions (~30% of daily traffic)
- **Nights (10 PM - 6 AM)**: Lower activity; primarily international users and night-shift workers (~15% of daily traffic)
- **Surge Times**: Days following major economic or political announcements; significant spike in new discussions (50-100% above baseline)

### Common Interaction Sequences

**Sequence 1: Passive to Active (Typical New User Path)**
- User browses as guest → Reads several discussions (3-5 over days/weeks) → Impressed by quality → Registers → Lurks reading without posting for few days → Posts first comment → Continues regular participation

**Sequence 2: Expert Contribution (Persona: Marcus)**
- Registered member logs in → Creates detailed discussion on expertise topic → Responds to all comments within first 24 hours → Becomes recognized expert → Receives moderator invitation → Begins moderating own category → Contributes more specialized discussions

**Sequence 3: Learning Journey (Persona: Sarah)**
- New member → Asks basic questions → Receives educational responses → Upvotes helpful responses → Follows top contributors → Gradually increases expertise → Contributes expert responses to newer members

### Role-Based Interaction Differences

**Guest Interaction**: Read-only; browse categories, search discussions, read comments without logging in. Cannot vote, comment, or create discussions.

**Member Interaction**: Create discussions, comment, reply, vote, edit own posts (within 24 hours), manage profile, flag content, receive notifications.

**Moderator Interaction**: All member capabilities plus flag review, content removal, warning issuance, discussion pinning, content editing (no time restriction), temporary user muting.

**Administrator Interaction**: All capabilities plus user account management, category creation, moderator management, policy enforcement, system analytics, billing management.
