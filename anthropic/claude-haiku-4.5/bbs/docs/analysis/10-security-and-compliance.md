# Security and Compliance Requirements for Discussion Board System

## 1. Security Overview and Principles

### Purpose and Scope

The discussion board system must implement comprehensive security measures to protect user data, maintain system integrity, and prevent unauthorized access or malicious activities. Security requirements apply to all users, data, and system functions regardless of user role.

### Foundational Security Principles

- **User Data Protection**: All user information must be protected from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure through encryption, access controls, and secure storage practices
- **Confidentiality**: Sensitive data must remain private and accessible only to authorized parties; encryption and role-based access controls enforce confidentiality
- **Integrity**: Data must remain accurate and unaltered except by authorized modifications; checksums and audit logs detect unauthorized changes
- **Availability**: System must remain operational and accessible to legitimate users; redundancy and DDoS protection ensure availability
- **Accountability**: All security-relevant actions must be logged, auditable, and traceable to specific users or systems
- **Authentication**: User identity must be verified before granting access to any protected resource
- **Authorization**: Access rights must be verified against defined permissions for each user action

### Security Objectives and Threat Model

The system SHALL protect against common security threats including but not limited to:
- **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers attempting to access accounts without credentials
- **Privilege Escalation**: Users attempting to elevate their permissions beyond authorization
- **Data Theft**: Attackers attempting to exfiltrate sensitive user data
- **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection, and similar code-level attacks
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Attackers injecting malicious JavaScript into web pages
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Attackers tricking users into performing unintended actions
- **Denial of Service**: Attackers attempting to overload the system and prevent legitimate users from accessing it
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**: Attackers intercepting communication between client and server
- **Malware and Phishing**: Distributing malicious code or deceiving users into providing credentials

### Security Ownership and Accountability

EVERY team member SHALL take responsibility for security as part of their role. Security is not an afterthought but integrated into every system function. Backend developers SHALL implement all security requirements. Security architects SHALL validate implementations. Administrators SHALL monitor ongoing compliance. Leadership SHALL allocate resources for security initiatives.

---

## 2. User Authentication and Authorization

### 2.1 Authentication System Architecture

THE system SHALL implement a JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication system that verifies user identity before granting access to protected resources.

WHEN a user attempts to access the system, THE system SHALL execute the following authentication flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["User Submits<br/>Email & Password"] --> B["System Validates<br/>Format & Length"]
    B --> C{Valid Format?}
    C -->|No| D["Return 400<br/>Bad Request"]
    C -->|Yes| E["Query Database<br/>for User Email"]
    E --> F{User Found?}
    F -->|No| G["Return 401<br/>Invalid Credentials"]
    F -->|Yes| H["Compare Password Hash<br/>with bcrypt"]
    H --> I{Password Match?}
    I -->|No| J["Increment Failed<br/>Login Counter"]
    J --> K{Exceeded 5<br/>Attempts?}
    K -->|Yes| L["Lock Account<br/>30 Minutes"]
    K -->|No| G
    I -->|Yes| M["Reset Failed<br/>Login Counter"]
    M --> N["Check Account<br/>Status"]
    N --> O{Active &<br/>Verified?}
    O -->|No| P["Return 403<br/>Account Not Active"]
    O -->|Yes| Q["Generate JWT<br/>Access Token"]
    Q --> R["Generate JWT<br/>Refresh Token"]
    R --> S["Create Session<br/>Record"]
    S --> T["Log Login Event<br/>with IP & Timestamp"]
    T --> U["Return Tokens<br/>& User Info"]
    U --> V["End<br/>Authenticated"]
    D --> W["End<br/>Error"]
    G --> W
    P --> W
    L --> W
```

### 2.2 Registration and Account Creation

**Registration Form Requirements**

WHEN a guest user attempts to register a new account, THE system SHALL present a registration form requesting the following information:
- Email address (validated against email format regex and uniqueness)
- Username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscore only, unique across system)
- Password (must meet complexity requirements as specified in Section 3.1)
- Display name (optional, 1-50 characters)
- Terms of Service acceptance (mandatory checkbox)
- Privacy Policy acceptance (mandatory checkbox)

**Registration Validation Process**

WHEN a user submits registration information, THE system SHALL validate each field:

IF the email format is invalid (does not match standard email regex), THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with message "Invalid email format. Please enter a valid email address."

IF the email is already registered, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 409 Conflict with message "This email is already registered. Please log in or use a different email."

IF the username format is invalid, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with message "Username must be 3-20 characters, containing only letters, numbers, and underscores."

IF the username is already registered, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 409 Conflict with message "This username is not available. Please choose a different username."

IF the password does not meet complexity requirements (see Section 3.1), THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with specific feedback about which requirements are not met.

IF Terms of Service or Privacy Policy are not accepted, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with message "You must accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to register."

**Account Creation Upon Valid Registration**

WHEN all validation checks pass, THE system SHALL:
1. Hash the password using bcrypt with cost factor of 12 or higher
2. Create a new user account with status "unverified"
3. Generate a unique email verification token (cryptographically random, minimum 32 bytes)
4. Set token expiration to 24 hours from creation
5. Send verification email within 30 seconds
6. Log the registration event with timestamp and IP address
7. Return HTTP 201 Created with success message

**Email Verification Process**

WHEN a user receives the verification email, THE email SHALL contain:
- Unique verification link with embedded token
- Explanation that email must be verified within 24 hours
- Link expiration time clearly stated
- Instructions for requesting new verification email if link expires

WHEN a user clicks the verification link within 24 hours, THE system SHALL:
1. Validate the token against stored token and expiration
2. Mark the user account status as "active"
3. Clear the verification token from database
4. Log the verification event
5. Display success message and redirect to login page

IF the verification link has expired or is invalid, THE system SHALL display error message: "Verification link invalid or expired. Click here to request a new verification email."

WHEN a user requests a new verification email, THE system SHALL:
1. Generate new verification token
2. Update token expiration to 24 hours from current time
3. Send new verification email within 30 seconds
4. Limit verification email requests to maximum 5 per hour per email address
5. Log the re-verification email request

**Unverified Account Restrictions**

WHILE a user account status is "unverified", THE user:
- CAN view public discussions and comments
- CANNOT create new discussions
- CANNOT post comments or replies
- CANNOT vote on content
- CANNOT access administrative or moderation features
- CAN log in to see UI prompting email verification

### 2.3 Login Process and Session Creation

**Login Request Processing**

WHEN a user submits login credentials (email and password), THE system SHALL execute the following validations:

1. Verify email format is valid (prevent injection attacks)
2. Verify password is provided (not empty or null)
3. Query user database by email address
4. IF user not found, return generic error (see Section 2.4 below)
5. IF user found, retrieve stored password hash and verify with bcrypt
6. IF password does not match, increment failed login counter
7. IF password matches, proceed to session creation

**Session Creation Upon Successful Authentication**

WHEN credentials are successfully validated, THE system SHALL:
1. Verify user account status is "active" (not suspended, banned, or unverified)
2. Generate JWT access token (15-minute expiration)
3. Generate JWT refresh token (7-day expiration)
4. Create session record in database with unique session ID
5. Record login timestamp, IP address, and user agent
6. Increment successful login counter (for analytics)
7. Log authentication event for security audit
8. Return tokens to client with HTTP 200 OK

**Token Response Format**

THE system SHALL return tokens in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "expiresIn": 900,
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "user": {
    "userId": "user-12345",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "username": "username",
    "displayName": "Display Name",
    "role": "member"
  }
}
```

**Login Security Feedback**

WHEN a user attempts to log in with invalid email, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized with generic message: "Invalid email or password." WITHOUT indicating whether the email exists.

WHEN a user attempts to log in with invalid password, THE system SHALL return the same generic HTTP 401 message, not distinguishing between invalid email and invalid password.

### 2.4 Brute Force Attack Prevention

**Failed Login Attempt Tracking**

THE system SHALL maintain a failed login counter per email address and per IP address, tracked separately.

WHEN a login attempt fails (invalid password or account not found), THE system SHALL:
1. Increment the failed login counter for that email address
2. Increment the failed login counter for that IP address
3. Record the failed attempt with timestamp
4. Evaluate both counters against thresholds

**Account Lockout Policy**

WHEN a specific email address experiences 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes, THE system SHALL:
1. Temporarily lock the account
2. Set lock duration to 30 minutes
3. Return HTTP 429 Too Many Requests with message: "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts. Please try again in 30 minutes or use password reset."
4. Send email to account holder: "Your account was locked due to multiple failed login attempts. If this was not you, please change your password immediately."
5. Log the account lockout event

WHEN the 30-minute lockout period expires, THE system SHALL automatically unlock the account and reset the failed login counter.

**IP-Based Rate Limiting**

WHEN an IP address experiences 20 failed authentication attempts within 1 hour, THE system SHALL:
1. Temporarily block that IP address from making authentication requests
2. Set block duration to 1 hour
3. Return HTTP 429 Too Many Requests to all subsequent authentication attempts from that IP
4. Log the IP block with reason and duration
5. Alert administrators if block is triggered

WHEN the 1-hour block period expires, THE system SHALL automatically unblock the IP address.

**Permanent Account Lockout for Critical Violations**

IF an account experiences 10 failed login attempts within 60 minutes, THE system SHALL:
1. Permanently lock the account (beyond the 30-minute temporary lock)
2. Send email to account holder with instructions to contact support
3. Log the permanent lockout event
4. Require administrator intervention to unlock

WHEN an administrator manually unlocks a permanently locked account, THE system SHALL:
1. Verify the request is from authorized administrator
2. Log who unlocked the account and when
3. Send email to account holder confirming the unlock
4. Document the reason for unlock in audit trail

### 2.5 Multi-Session Management

**Concurrent Session Limits**

WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL create a new session while maintaining existing sessions from other devices.

THE system SHALL allow a maximum of 5 concurrent active sessions per user account simultaneously.

IF a user attempts to create a 6th concurrent session, THE system SHALL:
1. Identify the oldest active session (by login timestamp)
2. Invalidate that session
3. Create the new session
4. Send email to user: "Your account was signed in from a new device. Your oldest session was ended."
5. Log the session termination

**Session Tracking Information**

FOR each active session, THE system SHALL maintain:
- Session ID (unique, cryptographically random)
- User ID
- Creation timestamp
- Last activity timestamp
- Expiration timestamp
- IP address
- User agent string
- Device information (extracted from user agent)
- Geographic location (derived from IP address)

**Session Timeout Policies**

WHILE a user is inactive (no API requests made), THE system SHALL track the inactivity duration.

IF a user remains inactive for 24 consecutive hours, THE system SHALL automatically terminate the session.

WHEN a session is automatically terminated due to inactivity, THE user SHALL be logged out automatically. THE next API request SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized with message: "Session expired. Please log in again."

**Multi-Logout Capability**

WHEN a user logs out from any device, THE system SHALL invalidate only that specific session (not all sessions).

WHEN a user views their account settings, THE system SHALL display list of active sessions with:
- Device name (derived from user agent)
- Geographic location
- Login date and time
- Last activity date and time
- Current session indicator (mark current device)

THE user SHALL be able to manually terminate any individual session or remotely log out all other sessions.

**Session Hijacking Detection**

WHEN an existing session makes an API request from an unusually different geographic location than previous requests, THE system SHALL:
1. Calculate geographic distance from last known location
2. Estimate time between last request and current request
3. Calculate required travel speed
4. IF required travel speed is impossible (e.g., 5000 miles in 10 minutes), FLAG the session as suspicious
5. Implement additional verification (see Section 2.6 below)

### 2.6 Account Takeover Prevention and Anomaly Detection

**Login Anomaly Triggers**

THE system SHALL monitor the following indicators of potential account takeover:
- Login from new geographic region for first time
- Login from multiple geographic regions within impossibly short time window
- Login from new device or browser
- Multiple simultaneous logins from different geographic locations
- Login at unusual times compared to user's normal patterns
- Sudden change in activity patterns (e.g., mass content creation)
- Multiple failed login attempts followed by successful login
- Multiple failed login attempts from different IP addresses

**Anomaly Response Procedure**

WHEN one or more anomaly indicators are detected, THE system SHALL:
1. Calculate anomaly risk score (0-100)
2. IF risk score < 30, send optional notification email
3. IF risk score 30-70, send mandatory security alert and require verification
4. IF risk score > 70, lock account and require administrative review

FOR medium-risk anomalies, THE system SHALL:
1. Send security alert email with details of suspicious activity
2. Include list of recent login locations and times
3. Provide link to verify login activity
4. Require user to confirm recognition of login
5. Allow user to revoke sessions if they don't recognize activity

FOR high-risk anomalies, THE system SHALL:
1. Immediately send security alert
2. Temporarily restrict account privileges (no posting, editing, moderation)
3. Allow read-only access to verify information
4. Require email verification or security questions to restore privileges
5. Alert administrators for manual review

**Unusual Activity Patterns**

WHEN a user's activity patterns change significantly, THE system SHALL detect and flag:
- Member who suddenly creates 100 discussions (when normal pattern is 5/week)
- Member who suddenly posts 500 comments (when normal pattern is 50/week)
- Member who suddenly votes on 10,000 items (when normal pattern is 100/week)
- Member who suddenly creates accounts impersonating other users

WHEN unusual pattern is detected, THE system SHALL:
1. Temporarily limit the user's posting and creation capabilities
2. Notify user via email of activity restriction
3. Provide instructions to contact support if account is compromised
4. Alert moderators to manually review the suspicious activity

### 2.7 Logout and Session Termination

**Explicit Logout Process**

WHEN a user clicks "Logout" button, THE system SHALL:
1. Immediately invalidate the current access token
2. Invalidate the current refresh token
3. Delete the session record from database
4. Log the logout event with timestamp
5. Clear client-side session cookies
6. Redirect user to login page

**Programmatic Session Termination**

THE system SHALL support the following session termination scenarios:

**Password Change Termination**
WHEN a user successfully changes their password, THE system SHALL:
1. Invalidate ALL existing refresh tokens for that user
2. Keep only the current access token valid (until normal expiration)
3. Force re-authentication on all other devices after access token expires
4. Send emails to all IP addresses of active sessions: "Your password was changed. If this wasn't you, change it immediately."

**Administrator Force-Logout**
WHEN an administrator manually logs out a user, THE system SHALL:
1. Terminate all active sessions for that user immediately
2. Send email to user: "Your account was logged out by an administrator."
3. Log the administrator action with timestamp and reason
4. Prevent user from creating new sessions until administrator review is complete (if needed)

**Security Compromise Response**
IF a user reports their account is compromised, THE system SHALL:
1. Immediately invalidate all active sessions
2. Lock the account temporarily
3. Send verification email to account holder
4. Require password reset and email re-verification
5. Log the incident in security audit trail

---

## 3. Password Security and Management

### 3.1 Password Complexity Requirements

**Mandatory Password Components**

THE system SHALL enforce the following password requirements:
- **Minimum length**: 8 characters
- **Maximum length**: 128 characters
- **Uppercase requirement**: At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- **Lowercase requirement**: At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- **Number requirement**: At least one numeric digit (0-9)
- **Special character requirement**: At least one special character (!@#$%^&*-+=?)

**Prohibited Password Patterns**

THE system SHALL reject passwords that:
- Contain the user's username (any case variation)
- Contain the user's email address (any case variation)
- Contain dictionary words used sequentially without sufficient complexity
- Are on the list of 10,000 most common passwords
- Repeat any character 3 or more times consecutively (e.g., "aaa")
- Contain keyboard patterns (e.g., "qwerty", "asdfgh")

**Complexity Feedback to User**

WHEN a user attempts to set a password that doesn't meet requirements, THE system SHALL display specific feedback:

```
✗ Password must be at least 8 characters (current: 6)
✗ Password must contain at least one uppercase letter
✓ Password contains at least one lowercase letter
✓ Password contains at least one number
✗ Password must contain at least one special character
```

WHEN a user sets a password containing their email or username, THE system SHALL return message: "Password cannot contain your email address or username."

### 3.2 Password Storage and Hashing

**Bcrypt Hashing Specification**

THE system SHALL NEVER store passwords in plain text format, database backups, logs, or any other location.

WHEN a password is created or changed, THE system SHALL:
1. Hash the password using bcrypt algorithm
2. Use cost factor of 12 or higher (allows for future increases in computational power)
3. Generate unique random salt for each password hash (bcrypt includes salt generation)
4. Store only the resulting hash (not the salt separately, as bcrypt includes it)

**Example Bcrypt Hash**:
```
Hash: $2b$12$abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJK1234567890123456789012
      (includes cost factor, salt, and hashed password)
```

**Password Comparison Process**

WHEN a user attempts to log in, THE system SHALL:
1. Retrieve the stored password hash
2. Hash the provided password using bcrypt with the same cost factor
3. Compare the newly computed hash with the stored hash using constant-time comparison
4. NEVER use simple string equality for password comparison (vulnerable to timing attacks)

**Impossible-to-Recover Design**

THE system design SHALL ensure that:
- Even with database access, the original password cannot be recovered
- Even with administrator access, the original password cannot be recovered
- Only comparison with correctly hashed password can verify identity
- There is NO backup mechanism to recover lost passwords except password reset

### 3.3 Password Reset Flow

**Password Reset Request**

WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" on login page, THE system SHALL:
1. Display form asking for email address
2. Accept email input and validate format
3. Do NOT indicate whether email is registered (to prevent account enumeration)
4. Process the request regardless of whether email exists

**Email Sent for Both Cases**

WHETHER the email is registered or not, THE system SHALL return success message: "If an account with that email exists, you will receive password reset instructions shortly."

IF email is registered:
1. Generate unique reset token (cryptographically random, 32+ bytes)
2. Encode token with timestamp and hash
3. Set token expiration to 1 hour from generation
4. Store token hash (not plaintext) in database
5. Send password reset email within 1 minute

IF email is not registered:
1. Do not send email
2. Do not create token
3. Log the password reset attempt for security monitoring
4. Still display success message (prevent account enumeration)

**Password Reset Email Contents**

THE password reset email SHALL include:
- Unique password reset link with embedded token
- Explanation of reset process
- Token expiration time (1 hour from generation)
- Statement: "If you didn't request this reset, ignore this email or change your password"
- Link to contact support if questions
- Note that link works only once

**Password Reset Link Processing**

WHEN a user clicks the password reset link, THE system SHALL:
1. Extract and validate the token from URL
2. Verify token format and signature
3. Check token expiration (if expired, reject with message "Reset link expired")
4. Check if token has been used before (prevent replay attacks)
5. Display password reset form if token valid

WHEN user submits new password, THE system SHALL:
1. Validate new password meets complexity requirements
2. Hash new password using bcrypt with cost factor 12+
3. Update stored password hash in database
4. Invalidate the reset token (mark as used)
5. Invalidate all existing sessions for the user
6. Send confirmation email: "Your password has been successfully reset"
7. Display success message directing to login page

**Reset Link Expiration and Re-request**

IF password reset link expires (1 hour from generation), THE system SHALL:
1. Display message: "This reset link has expired"
2. Offer option to request new reset email
3. When re-request clicked, generate new token and resend email

THE system SHALL limit password reset email requests to maximum 5 per hour per email address to prevent abuse.

### 3.4 Historical Password Management

**Password History Enforcement**

WHEN a user changes their password, THE system SHALL store hashes of the last 5 passwords in a password history table.

WHEN a user attempts to set a new password, THE system SHALL:
1. Check if new password matches any of the last 5 password hashes
2. IF match found, return error: "You cannot reuse a password from your last 5 changes. Please choose a different password."
3. IF no match, allow password change

**Password History Rotation**

WHEN a user changes their password:
1. New password hash is added to history
2. Oldest password hash is removed from history (keeping exactly 5)
3. History is retained indefinitely in database (for audit purposes if account compromised)

**Forced Password Changes**

WHEN administrator detects a compromised account or security incident, THE administrator CAN force a password change.

WHEN forced password change is initiated:
1. User's current password is invalidated
2. All existing sessions are terminated
3. User receives email: "Your password has been reset. Please set a new password on next login"
4. On next login, user is required to set new password before accessing system
5. New password must be different from last 10 passwords (stricter than normal policy)

---

## 4. JWT Token Management and Session Handling

### 4.1 JWT Token Structure and Claims

**Access Token Specification**

EVERY access token SHALL include the following JWT claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "discussionboard-auth",
  "aud": "discussionboard-api",
  "sub": "user-12345",
  "userId": "user-12345",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "username": "username",
  "displayName": "Display Name",
  "role": "member",
  "permissions": ["create_topic", "post_comment", "vote"],
  "emailVerified": true,
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234568790
}
```

WHERE:
- `iss` (issuer) = "discussionboard-auth"
- `aud` (audience) = "discussionboard-api"
- `sub` (subject) = User ID
- `userId` = Unique user identifier
- `email` = User's verified email address
- `username` = User's username
- `displayName` = User's display name
- `role` = Current user role (guest, member, moderator, administrator)
- `permissions` = Array of specific permission codes
- `emailVerified` = Boolean indicating email verification status
- `iat` = Issued at timestamp (Unix epoch)
- `exp` = Expiration timestamp (Unix epoch), 15 minutes after iat

**Token Signing and Algorithm**

THE system SHALL sign all JWT tokens using HS256 algorithm (HMAC with SHA-256).

THE JWT secret key SHALL:
- Be at least 256 bits (32 bytes) in length
- Be stored securely in configuration vault (never in code or version control)
- Be rotated every 90 days
- Use cryptographically secure random generation
- Be unique per environment (dev, staging, production)

**Token Expiration Times**

- **Access Token**: 15 minutes from issuance
- **Refresh Token**: 7 days from issuance

### 4.2 Token Lifecycle and Validation

**Token Validation on Every Request**

FOR every API request requiring authentication, THE system SHALL:
1. Extract token from Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. Validate token format (properly encoded JWT with 3 base64url parts)
3. Validate token signature using secret key
4. Validate iat (issued at) claim is not in the future
5. Validate exp (expiration) claim has not passed
6. Validate iss (issuer) claim matches "discussionboard-auth"
7. Validate aud (audience) claim matches "discussionboard-api"

**Failed Token Validation Responses**

IF token is missing from request, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized with response:
```json
{
  "error": "MISSING_TOKEN",
  "message": "Authentication token required. Please log in."
}
```

IF token format is invalid (malformed), THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized:
```json
{
  "error": "INVALID_TOKEN_FORMAT",
  "message": "Invalid authentication token format."
}
```

IF token signature is invalid, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized:
```json
{
  "error": "INVALID_TOKEN_SIGNATURE",
  "message": "Invalid authentication token. Please log in again."
}
```

IF token has expired, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized with specific error code:
```json
{
  "error": "TOKEN_EXPIRED",
  "message": "Authentication token expired. Please refresh your token or log in again."
}
```

### 4.3 Token Refresh Mechanism

**Refresh Token Usage**

WHEN an access token expires, THE client application SHALL use the refresh token to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.

WHEN client makes refresh request, THE request SHALL include:
```
POST /api/auth/refresh
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

**Refresh Token Validation**

WHEN the system receives a refresh token request, THE system SHALL:
1. Validate refresh token format (valid JWT)
2. Validate refresh token signature
3. Validate refresh token has not expired
4. Verify refresh token has not been used or revoked
5. Check if refresh token is on blacklist (revoked tokens)
6. Look up session in database to verify still active

IF refresh token validation fails at any step, THE system SHALL:
1. Return HTTP 401 Unauthorized
2. NOT issue new token
3. Require user to log in again
4. Log the failed refresh attempt for security monitoring

**New Token Issuance Upon Refresh**

IF refresh token is valid, THE system SHALL:
1. Generate new access token (15-minute expiration)
2. Generate new refresh token (7-day expiration)
3. Mark the old refresh token as invalidated
4. Log the token refresh event
5. Return new tokens with HTTP 200 OK

THE refresh token is single-use: when used to obtain new tokens, the old refresh token is invalidated and cannot be reused.

**Refresh Token Rotation Security**

WHILE a user has a valid refresh token, THE user can repeatedly obtain new access tokens without logging in.

IF a refresh token is compromised and used by attacker, THE:
1. Attacker can obtain new access tokens
2. Legitimate user's subsequent refresh attempts will succeed (both have same refresh token)
3. System detects duplicate refresh usage and revokes all tokens
4. Both attacker and legitimate user are logged out
5. Security alert is sent to account holder

THE refresh token should be stored securely on client (httpOnly cookie preferred, or secure local storage).

### 4.4 Session Management and Timeout

**Session Timeout Configuration**

THE system SHALL implement the following timeout policies:

**Access Token Timeout**
- Expires automatically 15 minutes after issuance
- No manual extension (must use refresh token to extend)
- Client application automatically refreshes before expiration

**Refresh Token Timeout**
- Expires automatically 7 days after issuance
- No extension; user must log in again to obtain new refresh token

**Inactivity Timeout**
- User sessions are monitored for activity
- IF 24 hours pass with no API requests from a session, THE session is marked for termination
- Next API request with an inactive session token returns 401 Unauthorized: "Session has expired"

**Absolute Session Timeout**
- Regardless of activity, sessions are terminated 30 days after creation
- User must log in again after 30 days
- Prevents indefinite session persistence

**Session Termination Scenarios**

THE system automatically terminates sessions when:
1. User logs out explicitly
2. User changes their password
3. User changes their email address
4. Administrator manually logs out the user
5. User account is suspended or banned
6. Session reaches timeout thresholds
7. Security anomaly is detected

WHEN a session is terminated, THE system SHALL:
1. Remove session record from database
2. Add tokens to revocation blacklist
3. Log the termination event
4. Return 401 Unauthorized on next request from that session

---

## 5. Data Protection and Encryption

### 5.1 Encryption at Rest (Data in Storage)

**Sensitive Data Classification**

THE system SHALL classify user data into the following sensitivity levels:

**LEVEL 1: PUBLIC DATA**
- Discussion topics and comments (publicly visible)
- User display names and avatars
- Discussion categories and metadata
- Aggregate statistics and metrics
- Encryption recommended but not mandatory

**LEVEL 2: MEMBER DATA**
- User profiles (non-private sections)
- Vote and rating history
- Discussion participation history
- Activity logs
- Encryption recommended, access controls mandatory

**LEVEL 3: PRIVATE DATA**
- Email addresses
- Hashed passwords
- IP addresses and login history

- Moderation actions and decisions
- User account management records
- Analytics and metrics
- Encryption mandatory, restricted administrator access only

**Encryption Algorithm Specification**

LEVEL 3 and LEVEL 4 data SHALL be encrypted using:
- **Algorithm**: AES-256 encryption (Advanced Encryption Standard, 256-bit key)
- **Mode**: GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for authenticated encryption
- **Key Size**: 256-bit (32 bytes) encryption keys
- **Authentication Tag**: GCM provides built-in authentication
- **IV/Nonce**: Unique random value for each encryption operation

Example encrypted field storage:
```
Plaintext: user@example.com
Encrypted: {"algorithm": "AES-256-GCM", "iv": "abc123...", "ciphertext": "xyz789...", "authTag": "def456..."}
```

**Encryption Key Management**

FOR each category of sensitive data, THE system SHALL:
1. Generate unique encryption keys per category
2. Store keys in secure key management service (never in code or database)
3. Rotate keys every 90 days
4. Maintain old keys for decryption of previously encrypted data
5. Re-encrypt old data with new key (key rotation process)
6. Log all key generation, rotation, and usage events

**Data Encryption Scope**

THE following fields SHALL be encrypted at rest:
- User email addresses
- User passwords (stored as hashes, additional encryption for defense-in-depth)
- User IP addresses and login history
- Personal account settings
- Session tokens and refresh tokens
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

THE following data MAY be encrypted (recommended but not mandatory):
- Discussion content (if confidentiality is critical)
- Comments and replies
- User profile information (display name, bio, avatar)
- Vote history

### 5.2 Encryption in Transit (Data in Motion)

**TLS/SSL Requirements**

ALL communication between client and server SHALL be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.

THE system SHALL:
- Enforce HTTPS-only communication
- Reject all HTTP requests (redirect to HTTPS or return error)
- Support TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 (TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated)
- Disable insecure cipher suites

**TLS Certificate Management**

THE system SHALL maintain TLS certificates with:
- **Certificate Type**: Domain-validated (DV) or Extended-validated (EV) SSL/TLS certificate
- **Key Size**: Minimum 2048-bit RSA (or ECDSA equivalent)
- **Signature Algorithm**: SHA-256 or stronger
- **Valid From**: Current date or earlier
- **Valid Until**: Renewal date before expiration
- **Subject**: Must match domain name exactly
- **Renewal**: Automated renewal 30 days before expiration

**Certificate Pinning (Optional Enhancement)**

FOR critical security-sensitive applications, THE system MAY implement certificate pinning:
1. Client application pins the server's SSL certificate public key
2. Prevents MITM attacks using rogue certificates
3. Requires careful update process when certificates rotate
4. Pin to certificate authority's public key (allows certificate changes)

**HSTS Policy**

THE system SHALL implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

WHERE:
- `max-age=31536000` = 1 year (very long duration)
- `includeSubDomains` = applies to all subdomains
- `preload` = allows inclusion in HSTS preload list for browsers

HSTS ensures that clients always use HTTPS and cannot be downgraded to HTTP.

### 5.3 API Security Headers

**Content Security Policy (CSP)**

THE system SHALL implement Content Security Policy header to prevent cross-site scripting attacks:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none';
```

**X-Frame-Options Header**

THE system SHALL set X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking attacks:
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

This prevents the page from being embedded in frames by any other website.

**X-Content-Type-Options Header**

THE system SHALL set X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME type sniffing:
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

**X-XSS-Protection Header**

THE system SHALL set X-XSS-Protection for additional XSS protection (legacy browsers):
```
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

**CORS Headers**

THE system SHALL implement proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted-domain.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

**Referrer-Policy Header**

THE system SHALL set Referrer-Policy to control information sent to other sites:
```
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

---

## 6. API Security and Request Validation

### 6.1 API Authentication Requirements

**Authentication for All Protected Endpoints**

EVERY API endpoint (except public read-only operations and authentication endpoints) SHALL require a valid JWT access token.

THE JWT token SHALL be provided in the HTTP Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

IF an API request is received without Authorization header, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized:
```json
{
  "error": "MISSING_AUTH",
  "message": "Authorization header is required"
}
```

IF an API request includes Authorization header but no "Bearer " prefix, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized:
```json
{
  "error": "INVALID_AUTH_FORMAT",
  "message": "Authorization header must be in format: Bearer <token>"
}
```

**Public vs. Protected Endpoints**

Public endpoints (no authentication required):
- GET /api/discussions (list discussions)
- GET /api/discussions/:id (view discussion)
- GET /api/users/:id/profile (view public profile)
- GET /api/categories (list categories)
- POST /api/auth/login (login)
- POST /api/auth/register (register)
- POST /api/auth/refresh (refresh token)
- POST /api/auth/forgot-password (password reset request)

Protected endpoints (authentication required):
- POST /api/discussions (create discussion)
- POST /api/discussions/:id/comments (post comment)
- PUT /api/discussions/:id (edit discussion)
- DELETE /api/discussions/:id (delete discussion)
- POST /api/discussions/:id/vote (vote)
- PUT /api/users/profile (update profile)
- DELETE /api/auth/logout (logout)
- All /api/admin/* endpoints
- All /api/moderation/* endpoints

### 6.2 Authorization Checks for Role-Based Access

**Permission Verification Process**

FOR every API request to a protected endpoint, THE system SHALL:

1. Extract and validate JWT token (as detailed in Section 4.2)
2. Extract user role and permissions from token claims
3. Query database to verify user's current role (token may be stale)
4. Check if user's role allows the requested operation
5. Check if user owns the resource (for user-specific resources)
6. Check if resource exists and is in valid state for operation
7. IF all checks pass, process request
8. IF any check fails, return HTTP 403 Forbidden

**Permission Denied Response**

IF a user attempts to perform an operation they don't have permission for, THE system SHALL return HTTP 403 Forbidden:
```json
{
  "error": "FORBIDDEN",
  "message": "You do not have permission to perform this action"
}
```

The error message should NOT reveal which permission is missing (avoid information disclosure).

**Role Hierarchy Enforcement**

THE system implements the following role hierarchy:
- Guest: No special permissions, read-only
- Member: Full participation, can create and modify own content
- Moderator: Can moderate assigned categories, all member permissions
- Administrator: Full system access, all permissions

WHEN a user has role "Moderator", THE system SHALL:
- GRANT all Member permissions
- GRANT moderator permissions for assigned categories
- DENY administrator permissions
- DENY ability to modify other moderators' decisions

WHEN a user has role "Administrator", THE system SHALL:
- GRANT all permissions across the system
- ALLOW overriding any other user's permissions
- REQUIRE all admin actions to be logged with audit trail

### 6.3 Input Validation and Sanitization

**Input Validation Process**

FOR every user-supplied input (query parameters, request body, file uploads), THE system SHALL:

1. **Type Validation**: Verify data type matches expected type (string, number, boolean, array, object)
2. **Format Validation**: Verify format is correct (email, URL, phone number, date, etc.)
3. **Length Validation**: Verify length is within acceptable limits (minimum and maximum)
4. **Pattern Validation**: Verify data matches expected regex pattern
5. **Range Validation**: For numbers, verify within acceptable min/max range
6. **Encoding Validation**: Verify UTF-8 encoding (reject invalid byte sequences)
7. **Whitelist Validation**: For known fixed values, verify against whitelist (don't use blacklist)

IF validation fails, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with specific error:
```json
{
  "error": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Email format is invalid",
  "field": "email",
  "value": "not-an-email"
}
```

**Specific Input Validation Rules**

- **Email addresses**: Must match RFC 5322 email regex; domain must not be blacklisted
- **Usernames**: 3-20 characters; alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen only
- **URLs**: Must start with http:// or https://; domain must not be blacklisted
- **Discussion titles**: 5-200 characters; no HTML or special formatting
- **Comments**: 1-2000 characters; no HTML tags (escaped or stripped)
- **Numbers**: Must be numeric (no leading zeros for integers); within range
- **Dates**: Must be valid ISO 8601 format; not in future (if required)
- **File uploads**: Whitelist allowed file types; verify MIME type; scan for malware

**Output Sanitization and Encoding**

WHEN user-generated content is displayed to other users, THE system SHALL:

1. **HTML Escaping**: Escape HTML special characters to prevent XSS
   - Replace `<` with `&lt;`
   - Replace `>` with `&gt;`
   - Replace `"` with `&quot;`
   - Replace `'` with `&#x27;`
   - Replace `&` with `&amp;`

2. **Context-Appropriate Encoding**:
   - For HTML context: HTML encode all content
   - For JavaScript context: JavaScript encode
   - For URL context: URL encode
   - For JSON context: JSON encode with proper escaping

3. **Example**:
   ```javascript
   User input: "<img src=x onerror=alert('xss')>"
   Encoded: "&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(&#x27;xss&#x27;)&gt;"
   Display: "<img src=x onerror=alert('xss')>" (rendered as plain text)
   ```

### 6.4 Rate Limiting and Throttling

**Rate Limit Configuration**

THE system SHALL enforce rate limits on all API endpoints:

| Endpoint Category | Rate Limit | Window | Response Code |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Authentication (login, register) | 5 per IP | 1 minute | 429 |
| Password reset | 3 per email | 1 hour | 429 |
| Discussion creation | 10 per user | 1 day | 429 |
| Comment posting | 30 per user | 1 hour | 429 |
| Voting | 60 per user | 1 minute | 429 |
| Search | 20 per user | 1 minute | 429 |
| General API | 100 per user | 1 minute | 429 |

**Rate Limit Headers**

WHEN a rate limit is in effect, THE response SHALL include headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 30
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 15
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1609459200
Retry-After: 45
```

WHERE:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit` = Total requests allowed in the window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` = Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` = Unix timestamp when limit resets
- `Retry-After` = Seconds client should wait before retrying

**Exceeded Rate Limit Response**

WHEN a user exceeds a rate limit, THE system SHALL return HTTP 429 Too Many Requests:
```json
{
  "error": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit. Please try again in 45 seconds."
}
```

**Rate Limit Implementation Details**

- Rate limits are tracked per user ID (for authenticated requests) or per IP address (for unauthenticated)
- Limits use sliding window algorithm (not fixed windows)
- New account (< 24 hours) limits are stricter: 3 discussions/day, 10 comments/hour
- VIP accounts (premium membership, if implemented) may have higher limits
- Administrative accounts may have no rate limits (or very high limits)

### 6.5 Request Signing and Integrity

**Request Signature Verification (Optional Enhancement)**

FOR highly security-sensitive operations, THE system MAY require request signing:

1. Client generates HMAC-SHA256 signature of request body
2. Client includes signature in X-Signature header
3. Server verifies signature matches computed hash
4. Prevents tampering with request body in transit

Example implementation:
```
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', SECRET_KEY);
hmac.update(requestBody);
const signature = hmac.digest('hex');
```

---

## 7. Abuse Prevention and Fraud Detection

### 7.1 Account Takeover Prevention

**Behavioral Analysis**

THE system SHALL continuously analyze user behavior to detect potential account compromise:

- **Geographic Changes**: Sudden login from different continent
- **Device Changes**: Sudden login from new device or browser
- **Time Changes**: Login at 3 AM when user normally logs in at 9 AM
- **Activity Changes**: Sudden surge in content creation or voting
- **Access Pattern Changes**: Unusual resource access patterns

**Impossible Travel Detection**

WHEN a user's session makes requests from two different geographic locations within impossibly short time, THE system SHALL:

1. Calculate distance between locations (using IP geolocation)
2. Calculate time elapsed between requests
3. Calculate minimum travel speed required
4. IF speed > maximum possible speed (airplane speed), FLAG as suspicious
5. Trigger anomaly detection procedure (see Section 7.2)

Example: Request from New York, then 5 minutes later from Tokyo = impossible without teleportation.

### 7.2 Anomaly Detection and Response

**Anomaly Risk Scoring**

THE system calculates an anomaly risk score (0-100) based on multiple indicators:
- New geographic location = +20 points
- Impossible travel pattern = +40 points
- New device/browser = +15 points
- Unusual time of day = +10 points
- Multiple simultaneous logins = +25 points
- Sudden activity spike = +15 points
- Multiple failed login attempts before success = +20 points

**Risk Score Actions**

- **Score 0-20** (Low): No action, optional notification email
- **Score 21-60** (Medium): Send security alert, require email verification
- **Score 61-100** (High): Temporarily restrict account, require 2FA/security questions

### 7.3 Spam and Flood Prevention

**Duplicate Content Detection**

WHEN a user attempts to post duplicate content, THE system SHALL detect:
1. Exact duplicate (word-for-word identical) within 10 minutes
2. Near-duplicate (> 95% similarity) within 1 hour
3. Flood patterns (rapid posting of different content)

IF duplicate detected, THE system SHALL:
1. Reject with message "This content is too similar to your recent post"
2. Suggest user add more original content
3. Log the duplicate attempt

**Flooding Prevention**

WHEN a user exceeds posting frequency thresholds, THE system SHALL:
1. Temporarily restrict posting capability
2. Display message "You are posting too quickly. Please wait before posting again"
3. Implement exponential backoff (longer wait with each violation)
4. Notify user when restriction lifts

**Spam Account Detection**

THE system automatically detects spam accounts by monitoring:
- Ratio of outbound links to original content
- Posting of identical content to multiple discussions
- Rapid account creation followed by posting
- Account creation from known spam IP addresses
- Sudden following/friending of many users

WHEN spam account is detected, THE system SHALL:
1. Flag account for moderator review
2. Reduce visibility of account's posts
3. Disable account temporarily pending review
4. Alert administrators

**Log Archival**

WHEN retention period expires, THE system SHALL:
1. Archive logs to long-term storage
2. Compress and encrypt archives
3. Verify archive integrity
4. Delete original logs
5. Log the archival action
6. Maintain index of archived logs for retrieval

### 10.3 Access to Logs

**Who Can Access Logs**

**LEVEL 1 Access** (Operations team):
- Can view current operational logs
- Can run searches within current period
- Cannot access admin access logs
- Cannot delete or modify logs

**LEVEL 2 Access** (Security team):
- Full access to all logs
- Can run complex queries
- Can export logs for analysis
- Cannot delete logs (audit trail prevents deletion)

**LEVEL 3 Access** (Administrators):
- Can view aggregated summaries
- Limited query access
- Cannot access authentication logs for all users
- Cannot modify logs

**LEVEL 4 Access** (Legal/Compliance):
- Can request specific log extracts
- Can view compliance-related logs
- Requires formal request process
- Cannot access all logs without reason

**Administrator Log Access Tracking**

WHEN an administrator accesses user personal data through logs or system, THE system SHALL:
1. Log who accessed what data
2. Log timestamp and duration
3. Log reason if provided
4. Flag unusual access patterns
5. Alert if administrator accesses data for user not under their responsibility

### 10.4 Log Monitoring and Alerting

**Real-Time Alert Triggers**

THE system SHALL generate alerts when:
- Authentication failure rate > 10 failures/minute from single IP
- Single user receives 5+ failed logins in 15 minutes
- Brute force attack detected (automated login attempts)
- Rate limit exceeded for multiple endpoints
- Unusual geographic login detected
- Administrator accesses sensitive data
- Unusual API activity detected
- Error rate exceeds 5% of requests
- Database performance degradation
- Certificate expiration warning (30 days before)

**Alert Severity Levels**

- **CRITICAL** (immediate notification): Data breach, system compromise
- **HIGH** (notify within 15 minutes): Failed authentication surge, anomaly
- **MEDIUM** (notify within 1 hour): Policy violations, resource issues
- **LOW** (within business hours): Informational alerts, maintenance reminders

**Alert Notification**

WHEN alert is triggered, THE system SHALL:
1. Send immediate email to on-call security
2. Create incident ticket
3. Log alert generation
4. Store alert context for investigation
5. Allow alert acknowledgment and status tracking

## 11. Vulnerability Management and Security Testing

### 11.1 Vulnerability Assessment

**Regular Scanning**

THE system SHALL perform vulnerability scanning:
- **Frequency**: Weekly automated scans
- **Scope**: All system components (code, dependencies, infrastructure)
- **Tools**: Industry-standard scanners (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Snyk, etc.)
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage by static analysis

**Vulnerability Assessment Process**

1. Run automated vulnerability scanners
2. Review results for false positives
3. Classify vulnerabilities by severity
4. Create remediation tickets
5. Assign to development team
6. Track remediation progress
7. Verify fixes with re-scanning
8. Document lessons learned

### 11.2 Penetration Testing

**Annual Penetration Testing**

THE system SHALL undergo professional penetration testing:
- **Frequency**: Minimum annually
- **Scope**: Full system including infrastructure
- **Methodology**: OWASP Testing Guide
- **Tester**: External professional firm (independent, not regular vendor)

**Post-Test Activities**

1. Receive detailed test report with findings
2. Prioritize findings by severity
3. Assign remediation owners
4. Track remediation progress
5. Conduct re-test to verify fixes
6. Document findings and remediation
7. Share learnings with team

### 11.3 Dependency and Library Security

**Dependency Monitoring**

THE system SHALL:
- Maintain inventory of all dependencies (npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.)
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Set up automated alerts for new vulnerabilities
- Evaluate vulnerability severity and exploitability
- Update dependencies promptly when security fixes available

**Dependency Update Process**

1. Security scanner detects vulnerable dependency
2. Evaluate severity (critical, high, medium, low)
3. Check if update is available
4. Test update in development environment
5. Verify no breaking changes
6. Deploy update to production
7. Verify system function after update

**SLA for Dependency Updates**

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Update within 24 hours
- **High severity**: Update within 1 week
- **Medium severity**: Update within 1 month
- **Low severity**: Update during regular maintenance window

### 11.4 Security Code Review

**Code Review Process**

BEFORE any code is deployed to production, THE system SHALL:
1. Require peer code review
2. Reviewer checks for security issues
3. Look for OWASP Top 10 patterns
4. Verify input validation is present
5. Verify output encoding is correct
6. Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
7. Check for authentication/authorization issues
8. Approve or request changes

**Security Review Checklist**

- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] All outputs properly encoded
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Authentication properly implemented
- [ ] Authorization checks present
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted
- [ ] Error messages don't leak info
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date
- [ ] No deprecated security functions

## Summary and Security Architecture

The security and compliance framework outlined in this document provides comprehensive protection across authentication, authorization, data protection, incident response, and compliance. All security requirements are mandatory and must be implemented before production deployment. Security is not a feature but a foundational requirement of the system.

---

> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements for security and compliance only**. All technical implementation decisions (specific libraries, frameworks, infrastructure tools, deployment strategies) are at the discretion of the development team. The document specifies WHAT security measures must be in place, not HOW to implement them technically.*
