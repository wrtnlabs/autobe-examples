## 🔗 Document Relationships

### Foundation Layer (Business Understanding)
[01-Service Overview](./01-service-overview.md) and [02-Problem & Solution](./02-problem-and-solution.md) establish why the system exists and what problems it solves. These documents are prerequisites for all other understanding.

### User Layer (People & Permissions)
[03-User Roles & Permissions](./03-user-roles-and-permissions.md) and [04-User Personas & Scenarios](./04-user-personas-and-scenarios.md) define who uses the system and how they interact. These inform all feature design.

### Feature Layer (What the System Does)
[05-Functional Requirements](./05-functional-requirements.md) and [06-Discussion Workflows](./06-discussion-workflows.md) specify all features and user interactions. These are the bridge between business intent and technical implementation.

### Operations Layer (Keeping it Healthy)
[07-Moderation & Governance](./07-moderation-and-governance.md) and [08-Business Rules & Constraints](./08-business-rules-and-constraints.md) define how the community stays healthy and how the system operates consistently.

### Infrastructure Layer (Supporting the System)
[09-Performance & Scalability](./09-performance-and-scalability.md), [10-Security & Compliance](./10-security-and-compliance.md), and [11-System Integration](./11-system-integration-and-external-services.md) define technical requirements for making the system reliable, secure, and scalable.

---

## ✨ Key Principles Across All Documents

### 1. User-Centered Design
Every feature and requirement is designed with user needs in mind. All decisions prioritize user experience while maintaining community standards.

### 2. Progressive Moderation
Rather than harsh immediate bans, the system uses progressive enforcement: warnings → temporary suspensions → permanent bans, giving users opportunities to improve.

### 3. Transparency and Accountability
All moderation actions are logged and auditable. Users understand why actions are taken. Appeals processes ensure fairness.

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
The platform prioritizes discussion quality and community health over maximum user growth. Success is measured by engagement quality, not total users.

### 5. Data Protection and Privacy
User data is protected with industry best practices. Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) are respected. Users control their own data.

### 6. Scalability from Day One
Architecture is designed to scale from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of users without rearchitecting core systems.

### 7. Business Requirements First
All documents focus on WHAT the system must do and WHY, not HOW. Technical implementation details are left to the development team.
