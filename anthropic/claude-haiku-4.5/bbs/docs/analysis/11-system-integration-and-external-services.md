# System Integration and External Services Requirements

## Integration Overview

The discussion board system integrates with several external services to provide core functionality including notifications, content storage, search capabilities, and analytics. This document defines all external service dependencies, integration patterns, and requirements for reliable system operation.

### External Services Summary

The system depends on the following categories of external services:
- Email delivery service for user notifications
- File storage service for user profile images and discussion attachments
- Search service for full-text indexing and discovery
- Analytics service for usage tracking and performance metrics
- Monitoring service for system health and alerting

### Integration Architecture Approach

All external integrations follow these principles:
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-critical integrations use message queues to prevent external service failures from blocking user requests
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Failed external service calls are automatically retried with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: The system remains functional if non-critical services fail, with reduced features
- **Timeout Enforcement**: All external service calls have strict timeouts to prevent indefinite waiting

### Dependency Management Strategy

THE system SHALL maintain a centralized configuration for all external service credentials and endpoints. Services are initialized at system startup and validated before accepting user traffic. Health checks run continuously to detect service failures early.

- THE system SHALL fall back to database-powered search immediately
- THE system SHALL display message: "Some search features temporarily unavailable, using basic search"
- THE system SHALL disable: autocomplete suggestions, advanced filters, sorting by relevance
- THE system SHALL enable: basic keyword search in titles and descriptions

Database fallback search specifications:
- Query: SELECT * FROM discussions WHERE title LIKE ? OR description LIKE ? ORDER BY created_date DESC
- Performance: 1-3 seconds for common queries
- Results: Limited to 100 results (vs. full search which supports pagination)
- Pagination: Basic offset-limit only (no cursor-based pagination)

WHILE search service is down:
- THE system SHALL queue all indexing operations
- THE system SHALL track queued indexes for bulk processing

WHEN search service recovers:
- THE system SHALL perform full reindex to catch up on queued operations
- THE system SHALL process queued indexes at accelerated rate (5x normal speed)
- THE system SHALL restore advanced search features and display: "Search functionality restored"

**Scenario 4: Analytics Service Unavailable**

WHEN analytics service is unreachable:
- THE system SHALL detect failure within 2 seconds (timeout)
- THE system SHALL buffer analytics events locally in message queue
- THE system SHALL continue full platform operation (no impact to users)
- THE system SHALL not display any error or outage messages (transparent failure)
- Administrators notified: Analytics data collection is temporarily unavailable

WHILE analytics service is down:
- THE system SHALL store events in memory/local database buffer
- THE system SHALL not drop events; queue continues to fill
- THE system SHALL monitor local queue size and alert if queue exceeds capacity

WHEN analytics service recovers:
- THE system SHALL send buffered events in batch
- THE system SHALL process queued events within 1 hour
- THE system SHALL resume normal real-time event tracking

### Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation

THE system SHALL implement circuit breakers for each critical external service to prevent cascading failures.

**Circuit Breaker States**:

1. **Closed State** (normal operation):
   - Service calls pass through to external service
   - Failure count is reset to 0
   - Call timeout: Service-specific (email: 10sec, storage: 30sec, etc.)

2. **Open State** (service failing, fail fast):
   - Service calls are immediately rejected without reaching external service
   - Caller gets error response immediately (no timeout wait)
   - Circuit remains open for fixed duration or until recovery detection
   - In-app fallback behavior activated

3. **Half-Open State** (testing recovery):
   - Limited requests (1 per 30 seconds) allowed to test if service recovered
   - If test request succeeds, transition to Closed state
   - If test request fails, return to Open state

**Transition Rules**:

Closed â Open:
- Triggered by: Consecutive failure threshold reached (5 failures)
- Duration in open: 5 minutes before transitioning to half-open
- Monitoring: Failure counts, timeout counts, error response codes

Open â Half-Open:
- Automatic transition: After 5 minutes in open state
- Testing: Next request after 5 minutes is allowed through

Half-Open â Closed:
- Triggered by: 5 consecutive successful requests
- Reset: Failure counter reset to 0, circuit fully opens (closed state)

Half-Open â Open:
- Triggered by: Any single failed request while half-open
- Reset: Back to open state with 5-minute wait

### Timeout Configuration

THE system SHALL enforce strict timeouts for all external service calls:

| Service | Operation | Timeout | Circuit Breaker Threshold |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------------------------|
| Email | Send email | 10 seconds | 5 consecutive failures |
| Storage | Upload file | 30 seconds | 5 consecutive failures |
| Storage | Download file | 15 seconds | 5 consecutive failures |
| Search | Index document | 5 seconds | 3 consecutive failures |
| Search | Query search | 5 seconds | 5 consecutive failures |
| Analytics | Send event | 2 seconds | 10 consecutive failures |
| DNS | Resolve domain | 5 seconds | 3 consecutive failures |

### Retry Strategy

**Exponential Backoff Formula**:
```
delay = base_delay * (multiplier ^ attempt_number)
Example: 100ms * (2 ^ 1) = 200ms, (2 ^ 2) = 400ms, (2 ^ 3) = 800ms
```

**Email Service Retry**:
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: 5 minutes later (300 seconds)
- Attempt 3: 30 minutes later (1,800 seconds)
- Attempt 4: 2 hours later (7,200 seconds)
- Max attempts: 4

**Storage Service Retry**:
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: 10 seconds
- Attempt 3: 1 minute (60 seconds)
- Max attempts: 3

**Search Service Retry**:
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: 100 milliseconds
- Max attempts: 2

**Analytics Service Retry**:
- Max attempts: 1 (no retry; buffer and retry later in batch)

## 7. Service Health Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Check Requirements

THE system SHALL perform automated health checks for all external services every 60 seconds.

**Email Service Health Check**:
- Method: Attempt to send test email to admin account
- Success: Email delivered within 5 minutes
- Frequency: Every 60 seconds
- Failure threshold: 2 consecutive failures trigger alert
- Recovery confirmation: 3 consecutive successful checks

**Storage Service Health Check**:
- Method: Attempt to upload, read, and delete test file
- Success: All operations complete within 15 seconds
- Frequency: Every 60 seconds
- Failure threshold: 2 consecutive failures
- Recovery confirmation: 3 consecutive successes

**Search Service Health Check**:
- Method: Execute test search query on known test document
- Success: Query returns expected result within 2 seconds
- Frequency: Every 60 seconds
- Failure threshold: 2 consecutive failures
- Recovery confirmation: 3 consecutive successes

**Analytics Service Health Check**:
- Method: Send test analytics event and verify in dashboard
- Success: Event appears in analytics dashboard within 5 minutes
- Frequency: Every 5 minutes (lower frequency for non-critical service)
- Failure threshold: 3 consecutive failures
- Recovery confirmation: 3 consecutive successes

### Alerting Thresholds and Notifications

WHEN health checks indicate service degradation:
- Single failure: Log in system event log
- 2 consecutive failures: Alert administrators via in-app notification
- 5 consecutive failures (open circuit): Page on-call administrator
- Service down > 15 minutes: Escalate to service owner/vendor

Alerts SHALL include:
- Service name and failed operation
- Last successful check timestamp
- Error message and response code
- Suggested troubleshooting steps
- Link to service status page
- Fallback functionality explanation

### Maintenance Windows and Communication

**Planned Maintenance Procedures**:

External service vendors SHALL notify system administrators:
- Minimum 48 hours advance notice
- Specific maintenance window with start and end times
- Estimated downtime (minutes/hours)
- Systems affected (search, email, storage, etc.)
- Expected impact on end users

WHEN planned maintenance is announced:
- THE system SHALL update status page: "Search maintenance scheduled for [date] [time]. Estimated duration: [minutes] minutes. Basic search will remain available."
- THE system SHALL display notification to administrators
- THE system SHALL prepare fallback mechanisms

DURING planned maintenance window:
- THE system SHALL update status page in real-time: "Maintenance in progress"
- THE system SHALL display message to users: "[Service] maintenance in progress. [Fallback] available."
- THE system SHALL activate fallback search/email/storage as appropriate

AFTER maintenance completes:
- THE system SHALL perform health checks to confirm recovery
- THE system SHALL update status page: "[Service] maintenance completed"
- THE system SHALL remove user-facing maintenance messages
- THE system SHALL notify administrators of successful restoration

## 8. Security and Compliance for Integrations

### API Key and Credential Management

THE system SHALL implement secure credential management:
- Store all external service credentials in secure vault (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or equivalent)
- Never store credentials in source code, configuration files, or logs
- Use separate API keys/credentials for each environment: development, staging, production
- Restrict credential access to authorized personnel and services only
- Implement principle of least privilege (each service only has credentials it needs)

THE system SHALL rotate credentials on defined schedule:
- API keys: Rotate every 90 days
- OAuth tokens: Rotate according to token expiration or 90 days, whichever is sooner
- Emergency rotation: Within 24 hours if key is suspected compromised
- Maintain backward compatibility: Keep previous key active for 7 days during transition

Credentials SHALL NOT appear in:
- Application logs (logs sanitized of sensitive data)
- Error messages shown to users (generic error messages only)
- Source control repositories or commits
- Configuration files in code
- Temporary files or backup files
- Error reporting/exception tracking systems

### Data Transmission Security

All communication with external services SHALL:
- Use HTTPS/TLS 1.2 or higher (no HTTP, no TLS 1.0/1.1)
- Verify SSL certificates valid and not self-signed
- Implement certificate pinning for critical services (email, storage)
- Enforce strong cipher suites (no deprecated ciphers)
- Use OAuth 2.0 or API key authentication (never basic auth with passwords)

THE system SHALL encrypt sensitive data before transmission:
- User email addresses encrypted in transit
- Personal identifiable information (PII) encrypted
- Authentication tokens transmitted in secure headers only
- Database connection strings use SSL
- No sensitive data in URLs or query parameters

### Third-Party Data Compliance

THE system SHALL ensure external service compliance:
- Data processing agreements (DPA) signed with all service providers
- GDPR compliance for data stored in external services
- Data residency requirements met (if data must remain in specific geographic region)
- Data breach notification procedures defined in contracts
- Right to audit security controls in contracts

Data sharing with external services LIMITED to:
- Email service: User email address, notification content
- Storage service: Profile image files only
- Search service: Discussion content (titles, descriptions, comments)
- Analytics service: Aggregated usage metrics (not PII)
- DNS/CDN: Technical data only (no personal data)

### Audit Logging for Integrations

THE system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs:
- Every API call to external service logged with: timestamp, API endpoint, parameters (sanitized), response status, response time
- Every data transmission logged with: data type, data volume, encryption status, sender/receiver
- Every credential usage logged with: who/what accessed credential, timestamp, for what purpose
- Every service failure and recovery logged with: timestamp, failure reason, resolution steps, duration

Audit logs retained for minimum:
- API call logs: 90 days
- Data transmission logs: 90 days
- Credential access logs: 1 year
- Service failure logs: 1 year

## 9. Summary and Integration Points

The discussion board system relies on carefully managed external service integrations to provide critical functionality while maintaining platform reliability and user experience. All integrations implement:

- **Asynchronous processing** where possible to prevent blocking user requests
- **Circuit breaker patterns** to fail fast and prevent cascading failures
- **Graceful degradation** so core functionality remains available during service disruptions
- **Comprehensive monitoring** to detect issues early and respond quickly
- **Secure credential management** to protect integration security
- **Fallback mechanisms** for non-critical services

This architecture ensures the platform remains responsive and reliable even when external services experience temporary unavailability.
