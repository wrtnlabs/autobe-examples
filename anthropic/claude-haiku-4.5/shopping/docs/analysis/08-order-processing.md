# Order Processing\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Order Processing system manages the complete lifecycle of customer orders from initial placement through fulfillment. This system coordinates between multiple platform components including inventory management, payment processing, shipping, and seller fulfillment to ensure reliable and traceable order processing.\n\nTHE Order Processing system SHALL serve as the central orchestration point for all transaction workflows, ensuring consistency between customer expectations, payment authorization, inventory allocation, and seller fulfillment responsibilities.\n\n## Order Placement Workflow\n\n### Complete Order Placement Process\n\nWHEN a customer initiates checkout from their shopping cart, THE system SHALL execute the following sequence of validation and processing steps:\n\n#### Phase 1: Cart Validation\n\nWHEN checkout begins, THE system SHALL validate that the customer's cart contains at least one item.\n\nWHEN validating cart items, THE system SHALL verify each item's current availability and price:\n- WHEN a cart item product status is \"ACTIVE\", THE item is available\n- WHEN a cart item product status is \"INACTIVE\" or \"ARCHIVED\", THE system SHALL reject the cart and display error\n- WHEN a cart item inventory quantity is insufficient, THE system SHALL reject and display available quantity\n- WHEN a cart item price has changed by more than 10%, THE system SHALL display price change warning and require customer confirmation\n\nIF any cart item validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL prevent checkout progression and notify customer with specific reasons.\n\n#### Phase 2: Delivery Address Selection and Validation\n\nWHEN customer proceeds past cart validation, THE system SHALL require selection of a delivery address.\n\nTHE customer SHALL select an address from saved addresses or add a new address.\n\nWHEN a new address is provided, THE system SHALL validate the address format and completeness:\n- THE address validation SHALL require street address, city, postal code, and country at minimum\n- THE system SHALL validate postal code format matches the selected country (5 digits for US, specific format for UK, etc.)\n- THE system SHALL validate that the address is recognized by available shipping carriers\n- THE system SHALL reject addresses flagged as restricted, military, or high-risk by shipping carriers\n\nIF address validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL display specific field error messages and prevent checkout progression.\n\n#### Phase 3: Shipping Method Selection\n\nWHEN customer proceeds to shipping method selection, THE system SHALL present available shipping methods based on:\n- Delivery address postal code and country\n- Total order weight and dimensions\n- Destination distance from seller/warehouse location\n- Seller's configured shipping methods\n- Carrier service availability in that specific region\n\nWHEN displaying shipping methods, THE system SHALL calculate and display:\n- Shipping cost for each method\n- Estimated delivery date range\n- Expected delivery window (if available from carrier)\n\nTHE customer SHALL select their preferred shipping method before proceeding.\n\nIF selected destination is not supported by any carrier, THEN THE system SHALL prevent checkout and suggest alternative addresses.\n\n#### Phase 4: Order Preview and Review\n\nWHEN customer reviews order before final confirmation, THE system SHALL display:\n- All items in the order with quantities and individual prices\n- Calculated subtotal (sum of all item prices × quantities)\n- Applicable taxes calculated based on delivery address\n- Shipping costs calculated based on selected method\n- Order grand total (subtotal + taxes + shipping)\n- Selected delivery address\n- Selected shipping method\n- Selected payment method\n- Estimated delivery date range\n\nWHEN displaying order preview, THE system SHALL perform final validation:\n- WHEN any item is no longer available, THE system SHALL display warning and prevent confirmation\n- WHEN any price has changed, THE system SHALL display new price and require confirmation\n- WHEN taxes or shipping calculation changed, THE system SHALL display updated totals and require confirmation\n\nIF any change prevents order confirmation, THEN THE system SHALL allow customer to return to cart to modify items.\n\n#### Phase 5: Order Creation and Payment Authorization\n\nWHEN customer confirms final order placement, THE system SHALL:\n1. Create an order record in \"PENDING_PAYMENT\" status with timestamp\n2. Record the order ID (unique identifier)\n3. Link the order to the customer account\n4. Reserve inventory for each ordered item (place inventory hold)\n5. Record the order timestamp\n6. Proceed to payment processing\n\nWHEN creating the order record, THE system SHALL capture:\n- All cart items with quantities, prices at time of order, and seller associations\n- Calculated subtotal, taxes, shipping, and total amount\n- Delivery address (complete and validated)\n- Shipping method and cost\n- Customer ID and verification status\n- Order status progression timeline\n\n#### Phase 6: Payment Processing\n\nWHEN order is created with PENDING_PAYMENT status, THE system SHALL initiate payment processing.\n\nWHEN payment is submitted, THE system SHALL validate payment amount matches order total exactly (see [Payment Processing Document](./07-payment-processing.md) for complete payment workflows).\n\nWHEN payment gateway confirms successful authorization, THE system SHALL:\n- Record authorization confirmation timestamp\n- Update order status to \"CONFIRMED\"\n- Atomically reduce inventory (convert reserved inventory to allocated inventory)\n- Proceed to order confirmation phase\n\nWHEN payment fails or times out, THE system SHALL:\n- Update order status to \"CANCELLED\"\n- Release all inventory reservations\n- Notify customer of failure with specific reason\n- Allow customer to retry or contact support\n\n#### Phase 7: Order Confirmation and Notifications\n\nWHEN payment is successfully processed, THE system SHALL:\n1. Update order status to \"CONFIRMED\"\n2. Record confirmation timestamp\n3. Atomically deduct inventory for each SKU in order (inventory commitment)\n4. Create individual seller orders for each distinct seller's products (if multi-seller order)\n5. Generate order confirmation number\n6. Send order confirmation to customer email\n7. Send order notification to all relevant sellers\n8. Link shipping tracking information when available\n\nWHEN order confirmation occurs, THE system SHALL atomically complete ALL of the following or NONE (atomic transaction):\n- Inventory deduction for all SKUs\n- Seller order creation for all sellers\n- Status update for all line items\n- Commission calculation\n- Order confirmation record creation\n\nIF any operation fails during atomic transaction, THE system SHALL rollback all changes and notify admin for manual intervention.\n\n### Order Placement Requirements Summary\n\nWHEN a customer places an order, THE system SHALL enforce the following requirements:\n\n- THE order SHALL contain between 1 and 500 items\n- THE order total SHALL not exceed $1,000,000 (system anti-fraud limit)\n- THE order SHALL include a validated delivery address\n- THE order SHALL include a selected shipping method\n- THE customer placing the order SHALL be verified and authenticated\n- ALL status transitions SHALL complete within defined timeframes\n- THE order SHALL maintain referential integrity with inventory records\n\n## Order Creation and Validation\n\n### Pre-Order Validation Checks\n\nBEFORE creating an order, THE system SHALL perform comprehensive validation:\n\n#### 1.
