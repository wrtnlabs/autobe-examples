# Order Management, Cancellation, and Refund Processing

## 1. Overview and Business Context

### 1.1 System Purpose

The Order Management, Cancellation, and Refund Processing system enables customers to request order cancellations and refunds within defined business windows, manage product returns, and resolve disputes. This system ensures fair treatment of both customers and sellers while maintaining platform integrity and preventing abuse.

### 1.2 Business Objectives

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Allow customers to cancel orders within reasonable time windows with transparent refund policies
- **Seller Protection**: Prevent unfair cancellations after sellers have invested in fulfillment efforts
- **Payment Security**: Ensure refunds are processed securely back to original payment methods
- **Dispute Resolution**: Provide mechanisms for handling disagreements between customers and sellers
- **Operational Efficiency**: Enable automated refund processing while supporting manual intervention for complex cases
- **Audit and Compliance**: Maintain complete audit trails of all cancellations and refunds

### 1.3 Key System Principles

- Cancellations are customer-initiated requests that may be accepted or rejected based on order status
- Refunds are monetary reimbursements processed through the payment system
- Returns involve physical product shipment back to sellers or fulfillment centers
- Disputes occur when cancellations/refunds are contested by either party
- All actions are reversible and fully auditable for compliance

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Refund Approved"] --> B["Calculate Refund Amount"]
    B --> C{"Refund Method?"}
    C -->|"Original Payment"| D["Issue Reversal/Credit"]
    C -->|"Store Credit"| E["Create Credit Balance"]
    D --> F["Update Payment Records"]
    E --> F
    F --> G["Notify Customer"]
    G --> H["Complete"]
```

```
Original Order (3 items from 2 sellers):
- Item A (Seller 1): $30 × 2 = $60
- Item B (Seller 2): $40 × 1 = $40
- Total: $100, Tax: $10, Total Paid: $110

Customer requests partial cancellation of Item A (qty 1) and Item B (qty 1):
- Refund Calculation:
  - Item A (1 unit): $30 + $3 tax = $33
  - Item B (1 unit): $40 + $4 tax = $44
  - Total Refund: $77
- Inventory Restored:
  - Seller 1: +1 unit of Item A
  - Seller 2: +1 unit of Item B
- Commission Reversed:
  - Seller 1: $3 (10% of $30)
  - Seller 2: $4 (10% of $40)
- Remaining Order:
  - Item A: $30 × 1 = $30
  - Total: $33 (with tax)
