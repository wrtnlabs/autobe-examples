# Payment Processing

## Payment System Overview

### Purpose and Core Principles

THE shopping mall platform SHALL support a complete payment processing system that enables customers to securely complete purchases, track payment status in real-time, and receive transaction confirmations. THE payment system integrates with third-party payment gateways to process credit card, debit card, and digital wallet payments while maintaining secure handling of sensitive payment information.

THE payment system SHALL be designed with the following core principles:
- **Security-first approach** with PCI-DSS compliance considerations
- **Real-time payment validation** and verification for all transactions
- **Comprehensive transaction logging and audit trails** for compliance and dispute resolution
- **Atomic operations** ensuring payment and inventory consistency
- **Clear error handling** with customer-friendly messaging
- **Support for partial refunds** and multiple payment methods
- **Payment reconciliation** between platform and payment gateway

THE platform SHALL maintain separation between payment gateway integration (handled by secure payment providers) and application-level payment management. THE application SHALL never directly handle or store sensitive payment card details; all sensitive payment processing SHALL be delegated to the payment gateway through industry-standard secure protocols.

THE payment system SHALL track complete transaction lifecycle from initiation through settlement, enabling administrators to reconcile payments, investigate disputes, and process refunds efficiently.

## Supported Payment Methods

### Credit Card Payments

WHEN a customer selects credit card as their payment method, THE system SHALL accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover cards. THE customer SHALL provide card details through a secure payment form that transmits data directly to the payment gateway using industry-standard encryption (TLS 1.2 or higher).

THE system SHALL NOT store complete card numbers; instead, it SHALL store only the card token provided by the payment gateway for future reference and dispute resolution.

WHEN a customer provides credit card information during payment, THE system SHALL require the following data:
- **Cardholder Name**: Full name exactly matching the cardholder's registered name on the card
- **Card Number**: 16 digits for most cards (Visa, Mastercard, Discover) or 15 digits for American Express
- **Expiration Date**: MM/YY format (e.g., 12/25 for December 2025)
- **CVV Security Code**: 3 digits for Visa/Mastercard/Discover or 4 digits for American Express
- **Billing Address**: Complete street address, city, state/province, ZIP/postal code, and country

THE system SHALL validate credit card information through Luhn algorithm verification and expiration date validation before submitting to payment gateway.

### Debit Card Payments

WHEN a customer selects debit card as their payment method, THE system SHALL process it through the same payment gateway using identical security protocols as credit cards. THE customer experience and validation requirements SHALL be identical to credit card payments, with the distinction being the card type (debit vs. credit) and the funds source.

THE system SHALL support both domestic debit cards and international debit cards in supported currencies.

### Digital Wallet Payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.)

WHEN a customer selects a digital wallet (Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, or similar wallet providers), THE system SHALL redirect to the wallet provider's authentication interface. AFTER the customer completes authentication with their wallet provider using biometric or PIN verification, THE system SHALL receive a secure payment token from the wallet provider.

THE system SHALL then proceed with payment processing using this token without requiring customer to re-enter payment details.

WHEN a customer uses digital wallet payment, THE digital wallet payment flow SHALL support:
- **One-click checkout**: Customers with saved payment methods in their wallet can complete purchase with single tap/click
- **Automatic address retrieval**: Billing and shipping addresses automatically populated from wallet when available
- **Reduced friction**: Significantly faster checkout process compared to manual card entry
- **Enhanced security**: Wallet provider handles sensitive payment data, platform never sees full payment details

THE system SHALL display wallet payment option only if the customer's wallet provider integration is currently operational.

## Payment Processing Flow

### Payment Initiation Phase

WHEN a customer clicks "Complete Purchase" on the shopping cart review page, THE system SHALL:

1. **Validate Cart Contents**: Verify that customer's cart contains at least one item and all items are still available in inventory
2. **Confirm Item Availability**: Check real-time inventory for each SKU in the cart to ensure sufficient quantities exist
3. **Verify Customer Eligibility**: Confirm customer account is active, not suspended, and in good standing
4. **Calculate Final Total**: Compute subtotal (sum of all item prices), applicable taxes based on delivery address, and shipping costs based on selected method
5. **Lock Cart**: Prevent further modifications during checkout to ensure consistent pricing

THE system SHALL display an order preview to the customer showing:
- Itemized list of all products with quantities and individual prices
- Subtotal amount
- Tax calculation with rate applied
- Shipping cost and method
- Grand total (subtotal + tax + shipping)
- Selected delivery address and customer contact information

THE system SHALL verify that no pricing changes or inventory issues have occurred since items were added to cart. IF any issue is detected, THE system SHALL inform the customer and request action before proceeding.

### Payment Validation Phase

BEFORE initiating payment with the payment gateway, THE system SHALL perform comprehensive validation:

**Order Total Validation:**
- THE system SHALL verify that customer cart subtotal matches the calculated order total
- THE system SHALL ensure no unauthorized price modifications occurred
- THE system SHALL validate that total does not contain calculation errors

**Customer Account Validation:**
- THE system SHALL verify customer account exists and is active
- THE system SHALL confirm customer email is verified
- THE system SHALL check customer account is not flagged for fraud or policy violations
- THE system SHALL verify customer is not in debt or has other account holds

**Delivery Address Validation:**
- THE system SHALL validate that delivery address is complete with all required fields
- THE system SHALL verify address format matches the selected country's postal standards
- THE system SHALL confirm address is recognized as deliverable by shipping carriers
- THE system SHALL reject addresses in restricted or high-risk zones identified by carriers

**Inventory Confirmation:**
- THE system SHALL perform final real-time inventory check for each item
- THE system SHALL ensure quantities requested are still available in stock
- THE system SHALL validate that seller inventory has not been depleted by other concurrent orders
- IF any inventory issue exists, THE system SHALL reject payment and notify customer of specific items that are unavailable

**Payment Method Validation:**
- THE system SHALL confirm the selected payment method is available and operational
- THE system SHALL verify payment method is supported in customer's country
- THE system SHALL validate that payment method can process the order amount (some methods have limits)

IF any validation fails, THE system SHALL reject the payment initiation and display a specific error message to the customer explaining the issue and required action.

### Payment Submission to Gateway

WHEN a customer confirms payment after all validations pass, THE system SHALL:

1. **Create Payment Request**: Format payment details according to payment gateway API specifications
2. **Include Order Details**: Embed order ID, customer identification, order amount, and currency
3. **Add Risk Information**: Include billing address, shipping address, customer email for fraud assessment
4. **Transmit Securely**: Send payment request to gateway using HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ encryption
5. **Record Request Timestamp**: Log the exact time payment request was transmitted

THE payment request to the payment gateway SHALL include:
- **Payment Amount**: Order total in smallest currency unit (cents for USD)
- **Currency Code**: ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP)
- **Order Reference**: Unique order ID for correlation
- **Customer Information**: Name, email address, phone number
- **Billing Address**: Complete billing address for verification
- **Shipping Address**: Delivery address for risk assessment
- **Payment Method Token**: Tokenized payment method (not raw card data)
- **Order Description**: Brief description of items for gateway records
- **Merchant Reference**: Unique merchant ID for payment processor

THE system SHALL NOT include sensitive data (full card numbers, CVV codes) in payment request to the gateway.

### Payment Gateway Response Processing

WHEN the payment gateway processes the payment, it SHALL return a response indicating success or failure with a transaction ID. THE system SHALL interpret payment gateway responses as follows:

**Successful Payment Response:**
THE gateway SHALL return:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier assigned by payment processor to this transaction
- **Authorization Code**: Confirmation that payment was approved by card issuer
- **Card Token**: Tokenized payment method for potential future transactions (if customer authorizes)
- **Payment Reference Number**: Reference number for customer support inquiries

- **Settlement Timeline**: When funds will be transferred to merchant account

**Failed Payment Response:**
THE gateway SHALL return:
- **Error Code**: Specific error code indicating failure reason (e.g., insufficient_funds, card_declined, fraud_detected)
- **Error Description**: Detailed description of failure reason
- **Decline Code**: Card issuer decline code for diagnostics
- **Transaction ID**: ID assigned even for failed attempts (for tracking)
- **Recommendation**: Suggested action for customer (retry with different card, contact bank, etc.)

THE system SHALL interpret specific error codes and provide appropriate customer messaging:
- **Insufficient Funds**: "Your card has insufficient funds. Please use a different card or add funds to your account."
- **Card Expired**: "Your card has expired. Please use a different card or update your card expiration date."
- **Invalid Card**: "The card number or expiration date is invalid. Please verify your card details."
- **Card Declined**: "Your card was declined. Please contact your bank or use a different payment method."
- **Fraud Detected**: "This transaction was declined due to security concerns. Please contact your bank or our support team."
- **Processing Error**: "A temporary error occurred while processing your payment. Please try again in a few moments."

### Order Creation After Successful Payment

WHEN payment is successfully processed and approved, THE system SHALL immediately:

1. **Create Order Record**: Generate new order with status "Payment Confirmed"
2. **Atomically Reduce Inventory**: Reduce inventory quantities for each SKU in the order
3. **Record Transaction Details**: Store payment method, transaction ID, and amount
4. **Generate Order Number**: Create unique order identifier (e.g., ORD-20240115-000001)
5. **Timestamp All Events**: Record exact timestamps for order creation and payment confirmation

THE order creation process SHALL include:

- Delivery address
- Customer contact information (phone, email)
- Required fulfillment deadline (typically within 48 hours)

### Order Creation Failure Scenarios

IF payment processing fails for any reason, THE system SHALL NOT create an order record. THE system SHALL:

1. **Preserve Shopping Cart**: Keep all items in customer's cart unchanged
2. **Log Failure Details**: Record the payment failure with specific error code and description
3. **Display Error Message**: Show customer-friendly error message explaining the payment failure
4. **Provide Recovery Options**: Offer customer options to retry payment, use different payment method, or contact support
5. **Release Inventory Hold**: Any temporary inventory reservation is released (customer still sees items available)

THE system SHALL display specific error messages to customer based on failure reason:
- IF insufficient funds: "Your payment was declined due to insufficient funds. Please verify your balance or use a different payment method."
- IF card expired: "Your card has expired. Please update your card details or use a different payment method."
- IF fraud detected: "Your payment was declined for security reasons. Please contact your card issuer or use a different payment method."
- IF network error: "A temporary network error occurred. Please check your connection and try again."
- IF payment gateway timeout: "Payment processing timed out. Please wait a moment and try again."

THE customer's shopping cart SHALL remain available for immediate retry after payment failure.

## Transaction Management

### Transaction Lifecycle States

EACH payment transaction progresses through defined lifecycle states. THE system SHALL track and manage these states:

| Transaction State | Description | System Actions | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Initiated** | Payment request created and queued | Request formatted, awaiting submission | Seconds |
| **Pending** | Payment sent to gateway, awaiting processing | Polling gateway for response | 30-300 seconds |
| **Processing** | Gateway actively processing authorization | Checking with card issuer | 10-60 seconds |
| **Completed** | Payment successfully authorized and captured | Order created, funds committed | Final state |
| **Failed** | Payment declined or error occurred | Error logged, order not created | Final state |
| **Disputed** | Payment challenged by customer or issuer | Escalated for investigation | Until resolved |
| **Reversed** | Payment refunded or reversed | Funds returned to customer | 5-10 business days |

### Transaction Record Creation and Storage

WHEN a customer submits payment, THE system SHALL create a transaction record containing:

- **Error Details**: If failed, the error code and description

THE transaction record SHALL be immutable—once created, it SHALL NOT be deleted or modified except for status updates and refund tracking.

### Duplicate Payment Prevention

WHEN a customer submits a payment request, THE system SHALL implement mechanisms to prevent duplicate charges:

**Idempotency Key Implementation:**
- WHEN a payment request is created, THE system SHALL generate a unique idempotency key combining order ID, customer ID, and timestamp
- THE system SHALL store this idempotency key in the transaction record
- IF the same payment request is submitted again within 10 minutes with the same idempotency key, THE system SHALL return the previous transaction result instead of creating a new charge

**Payment Lock Mechanism:**
- WHEN a customer initiates payment for an order, THE system SHALL lock that order from concurrent payment attempts
- IF another payment is submitted for the locked order, THE system SHALL queue it or reject it with message "Payment already in progress"
- THE lock SHALL be released when payment completes or times out (15-minute timeout)

**Duplicate Detection:**
- IF a customer is charged twice for the same order (payment gateway error), THE system SHALL:
  1. Detect the duplicate through transaction record matching
  2. Automatically refund the duplicate charge
  3. Alert the admin and customer
  4. Investigate the cause to prevent recurrence

### Transaction Reconciliation

THE system SHALL periodically reconcile transaction records with payment gateway settlement records:

**Daily Reconciliation Process:**
- EACH day, THE system SHALL query payment gateway for all transactions from previous 24 hours
- THE system SHALL compare gateway record with platform transaction records
- THE system SHALL identify discrepancies (transactions in gateway but not in platform, or vice versa)
- WHERE discrepancies exist, THE system SHALL log discrepancy and alert admin for investigation

**Failed Transaction Recovery:**
- WHERE transaction is in "pending" state but no update received from gateway for 30+ minutes, THE system SHALL query gateway for final status
- IF gateway confirms transaction succeeded but platform shows failed, THE system SHALL update transaction status to completed
- IF gateway confirms transaction failed but platform shows succeeded, THE system SHALL refund customer and mark transaction as failed

**Settlement Verification:**
- THE system SHALL verify that funds from completed transactions appear in merchant bank account
- WHERE funds are missing, THE system SHALL investigate and escalate to payment processor

## Payment Security

### Payment Data Protection Requirements

THE system SHALL encrypt all payment-related data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher encryption. All API endpoints handling payment information SHALL require HTTPS connections; HTTP connections SHALL be automatically redirected to HTTPS or rejected.

THE system SHALL NOT store, log, or cache complete credit card numbers, CVV codes, or other sensitive payment card details. ONLY the card token provided by the payment gateway MAY be stored for future reference.

**Payment Data Storage:**
- THE system SHALL store card tokens (not card numbers) securely in encrypted database fields
- THE system SHALL store only last 4 digits of card for customer reference
- THE system SHALL encrypt sensitive fields using AES-256 encryption
- THE system SHALL maintain separate encryption keys for different sensitive data types
- THE system SHALL rotate encryption keys every 90 days

**Payment Data in Logs:**
- THE system SHALL NEVER log full card numbers, CVV codes, or complete payment details
- THE system SHALL allow logging of transaction outcomes (success/failure) but not payment details
- THE system SHALL sanitize error messages to prevent exposure of payment information
- WHERE sensitive data appears in logs accidentally, THE system SHALL detect and mask it

### PCI-DSS Compliance Requirements

THE payment processing system SHALL be designed to comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) requirements:

**Card Processing:**
- THE system SHALL use a PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant payment gateway provider for all card processing
- THE system SHALL NOT directly process or validate credit card numbers; all card processing SHALL be delegated to the compliant gateway
- THE system SHALL use payment gateway iFrame or hosted payment page to collect card data (reduces platform PCI scope)

**Secure Communication:**
- THE system SHALL implement HTTPS/TLS for all payment-related communications
- THE system SHALL use TLS 1.2 or higher (no older protocols)
- THE system SHALL validate SSL/TLS certificates on all connections
- THE system SHALL reject insecure connections immediately

**Access Controls:**
- THE system SHALL restrict payment data access to authorized personnel only
- THE system SHALL require strong authentication for access to payment-related systems

- THE system SHALL generate compliance reports for PCI-DSS validation
- THE system SHALL undergo annual security testing and vulnerability assessments
- THE system SHALL maintain documentation of security practices

### Fraud Detection and Prevention

THE payment gateway provider SHALL perform fraud detection on all transactions using industry-standard algorithms:

**Fraud Risk Scoring:**
- WHEN a payment is submitted, THE gateway SHALL assign a fraud risk score (0-100 scale)
- THE system SHALL receive the fraud score in the gateway response
- SCORES 0-20: Low risk, approve automatically
- SCORES 21-50: Medium risk, approve but monitor
- SCORES 51-80: High risk, may request additional verification
- SCORES 81-100: Very high risk, consider declining or requiring manual review

**Fraud Prevention Measures:**
- THE system SHALL implement address verification (AVS) checking card billing address against issuer records
- THE system SHALL implement CVV verification confirming CVV matches card issuer records
- THE system SHALL monitor for multiple failed payment attempts and implement temporary block after 5 failures in 30 minutes
- THE system SHALL flag transactions where billing address differs significantly from shipping address
- THE system SHALL track velocity patterns (multiple charges to same card in short time) and flag anomalies
- THE system SHALL maintain a fraud rule database with patterns identified from past fraudulent transactions

**3D Secure Authentication:**
- THE system MAY implement 3D Secure (3DS) authentication for high-risk transactions
- WHEN 3DS is triggered, THE customer SHALL complete additional verification through their bank
- THE system SHALL honor 3DS verification results from banks
- 3DS verification increases fraud protection for both platform and customer

**Suspicious Transaction Handling:**
- WHEN a transaction is flagged as high-risk, THE system SHALL:
  1. Process payment with additional verification
  2. Request customer identity confirmation via email link
  3. Potentially require customer to verify through bank app or portal
  4. Hold order fulfillment pending fraud clearance
- WHEN fraud is confirmed, THE system SHALL immediately refund the customer and block further transactions from that payment method

### Secure Payment Form

- THE form data SHALL be submitted directly to the payment gateway's secure servers (NOT through platform servers)
- THE platform application SHALL NEVER see the sensitive card data
- THE platform SHALL receive only a non-sensitive token from the payment gateway

**Payment Form Validation:**
- THE form SHALL validate card number format as user types (Luhn algorithm check)
- THE form SHALL validate expiration date is future date
- THE form SHALL validate CVV is numeric code of correct length
- THE form SHALL display real-time validation feedback to user
- THE form SHALL prevent submission if validation fails

**Session Security During Payment:**
- WHEN a customer initiates payment, THE system SHALL require an active, authenticated session
- EXPIRED sessions SHALL be treated as payment cancellation, requiring customer to log in again
- THE payment session SHALL timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity
- IF payment is not completed within 15 minutes, THE system SHALL cancel payment and return cart to customer

---

## Refund Processing

### Refund Eligibility Determination

WHEN a customer or admin requests a refund for an order, THE system SHALL determine eligibility based on order status and time elapsed:

**Refund Eligibility Criteria:**
- THE system SHALL check order has been delivered (status = "Delivered" or "Completed")
- THE system SHALL verify refund request is within 30 days of order delivery confirmation
- THE system SHALL verify order has not already been fully refunded
- THE system SHALL verify order is not already in a dispute or chargeback process
- THE system SHALL verify customer account is in good standing (not flagged for fraud)
- THE system SHALL verify order is not for a restricted product category (if applicable)

**Ineligible Refund Scenarios:**
- IF order is more than 30 days old, THEN refund is NOT automatically eligible (requires admin intervention)
- IF order has already been refunded, THEN subsequent refund request SHALL be denied
- IF order is in dispute or chargeback status, THEN refund processing SHALL be held pending dispute resolution
- IF customer account is flagged for fraud, THEN refund SHALL require admin verification before processing

### Refund Request Process

WHEN a customer initiates a refund request, THE system SHALL:

1. **Display Refund Request Form**: Present form asking customer to provide reason and details
2. **Collect Refund Details**: Ask customer to specify items being returned and condition
3. **Support Documentation**: Request photos or supporting evidence if applicable (for defect claims)
4. **Submit Request**: Create refund request record with all details
5. **Notify Seller**: Alert seller of refund request requiring their response

**Refund Request Reasons:**
THE customer SHALL select a reason from predefined list:
- "Product is defective or broken"
- "Product does not match description"
- "Product arrived damaged"
- "Wrong product received"
- "Changed mind about purchase"
- "Product arrived late or not delivered"
- "Other reason" (requires explanation)

**Refund Request Timeline:**
- WHEN refund request is submitted, THE system SHALL set initial status to "Submitted"
- WITHIN 48 hours, THE seller SHALL review and respond to refund request
- IF seller does not respond within 48 hours, THE system SHALL auto-approve refund
- WHERE refund requires investigation (defect claim), THEN admin review may take 3-5 business days

### Refund Amount Calculation

THE system SHALL calculate refund amounts based on specific scenarios:

**Full Order Refund:**
- WHERE customer requests refund of entire order, THE refund amount SHALL equal order total
- REFUND = Customer Payment Amount (including taxes and shipping)
- WHERE order included discount or promotion, THE discount SHALL remain applied (customer benefits from discount in refund)

**Partial Item Refund:**
- WHERE customer returns only specific items from multi-item order, THE refund SHALL be proportional
- REFUND = (Item Price × Quantity Returned) + (Proportional Tax) + (Proportional Shipping)
- EXAMPLE: If order was $100 (80 product + 10 tax + 10 shipping) and customer returns items worth $50, refund = $50 + $5 + $5 = $60

**Damage or Condition Deduction:**
- WHERE item is damaged due to customer misuse, THE system MAY deduct up to 25% from refund
- WHERE item shows signs of use or damage beyond normal examination, THE system MAY deduct 10-20%
- WHERE item is returned in unopened, original packaging, THE refund SHALL be full (100%)
- DEDUCTION EXAMPLE: Item worth $100 returned with damage = $100 × 80% = $80 refund

**Restocking Fee:**
- THE platform SHALL NOT normally charge restocking fees
- WHERE a restocking fee applies (clearly disclosed at purchase), THE refund may be reduced by that fee amount
- RESTOCKING FEE = Maximum 10% of item price

### Refund Processing Workflow

WHEN a refund is approved, THE system SHALL process it through the payment system:

1. **Approval Recording**: Record that refund has been approved with reason and amount
2. **Payment Processing**: Initiate refund to original payment method
3. **Inventory Restoration**: If applicable, restore inventory for returned items
4. **Commission Reversal**: If seller earned commission on this order, reverse commission from seller account
5. **Notification**: Send confirmation emails to customer and seller

**Refund Execution Steps:**
- WHEN refund is approved, THE system SHALL create refund transaction record
- THE system SHALL include original payment transaction ID for linking
- THE system SHALL submit refund request to payment gateway with:
  - Original transaction ID
  - Refund amount
  - Refund reason code
  - Merchant reference
- THE payment gateway SHALL reverse funds to customer's original payment method

**Refund Timeline and Customer Communication:**
- WHEN refund is approved, THE system SHALL display message "Refund Approved - Your refund has been processed"
- THE system SHALL inform customer when refund will appear in their account (typically 3-7 business days for card refunds)
- FOR card refunds: 3-7 business days processing by customer's bank
- FOR digital wallet: 1-3 business days processing by wallet provider
- THE system SHALL send email confirmation with refund amount, processing date, and expected timeline

### Refund Status Tracking

THE system SHALL track refund through multiple status states:

| **Seller Rejected** | Seller rejected refund request | Customer can escalate or close |
| **Approved** | Refund approved (seller or admin) | Process refund to payment method |
| **Processing** | Refund submitted to payment gateway | Waiting for gateway confirmation |
| **Completed** | Refund successfully transferred to customer | Case closed |
| **Failed** | Refund processing failed | Requires retry or investigation |
| **Disputed** | Refund is under dispute | Admin investigation required |

### Partial Refunds

WHEN a customer returns only some items from a multi-item order, THE system SHALL process a partial refund:

**Partial Refund Calculation:**
- THE system SHALL identify which items are being returned
- THE system SHALL sum prices of returned items only
- THE system SHALL calculate proportional tax: (Returned Item Total / Original Subtotal) × Original Tax
- THE system SHALL calculate proportional shipping (if shipping is not per-item, use proportional split)
- PARTIAL_REFUND = Sum of Returned Item Prices + Proportional Tax

**Inventory Restoration:**
- WHERE partial return is processed, THE system SHALL restore inventory only for returned items
- ITEMS NOT RETURNED: Remain deducted from inventory (customer keeps them)
- ITEMS RETURNED: Restored to seller's available inventory for resale

**Order Status After Partial Refund:**
- WHERE partial refund is processed, THE order status SHALL remain "Completed"
- THE order record SHALL indicate which items were returned and which were kept
- THE original order SHALL show original total, refund amount, and net amount paid

### Refund Failure Handling

IF a refund fails to process through the payment gateway, THE system SHALL:

1. **Detect Failure**: Identify that refund was declined or failed to process
2. **Log Details**: Record failure reason provided by payment gateway
3. **Retry Automatically**: Automatically retry refund processing once after 24 hours
4. **Notify Admin**: Alert admin to failed refund requiring investigation
5. **Customer Communication**: Notify customer of delay and escalation

**Refund Failure Scenarios and Recovery:**

## Payment Validation Rules

### Amount Validation

WHEN a payment is submitted, THE system SHALL validate that the payment amount exactly matches the calculated order total. THE validation SHALL compare:

- **Cart Subtotal**: Sum of all item prices at their listed prices × quantities
- **Applicable Taxes**: Calculated based on delivery address jurisdiction and tax rate
- **Shipping Cost**: Calculated based on selected shipping method and destination
- **Applied Discounts**: Any promotional codes or automatic discounts applied
- **Final Total**: Subtotal + Tax + Shipping - Discounts

**Amount Matching Rules:**
- THE payment amount MUST match the calculated order total exactly (within currency precision)
- FOR USD: Amounts must match to the cent (e.g., $19.99 must match exactly, not $19.98 or $20.00)
- IF payment amount differs from calculated total by more than the currency's smallest unit, THEN payment SHALL be rejected
- THE system SHALL reject payment with error message indicating discrepancy

**Amount Limits:**
- THE system SHALL enforce MINIMUM order value of $0.01 (one cent)
- THE system SHALL enforce MAXIMUM order value of $999,999.99 to prevent accidental large transactions
- IF order total is less than $0.01, THEN order SHALL be rejected before payment attempt
- IF order total exceeds $999,999.99, THEN order SHALL be rejected with message "Order exceeds maximum limit"

### Currency Validation

THE system SHALL accept payments only in USD (United States Dollars) for the initial platform implementation.

**Currency Consistency:**
- WHEN an order is created, THE system SHALL specify currency (USD)
- WHEN payment is submitted, THE system SHALL validate that payment currency matches order currency
- IF payment currency differs from order currency, THEN payment SHALL be rejected

**Future Multi-Currency Support:**
- WHEN international support is added, THE system SHALL support additional currencies
- EACH order SHALL be created in a single currency (customer selects currency during checkout)
- PAYMENT MUST match order currency exactly

### Address Validation

BEFORE accepting payment, THE system SHALL validate both billing and shipping addresses:

**Billing Address Validation:**

**Account History Validation:**
- THE system SHALL check for unusual account activity patterns (multiple failed logins, refund requests, chargebacks)
- HIGH-RISK ACCOUNTS may require additional verification or manual approval
- THE system SHALL use fraud scoring to determine if account poses risk

### Inventory Validation (Final Confirmation)

WHEN a payment is successfully processed and an order is about to be created, THE system SHALL perform one final inventory check:

**Final Inventory Confirmation:**
- THE system SHALL verify each item in the order has sufficient available inventory
- THE system SHALL validate that SKU identifiers haven't changed since addition to cart
- THE system SHALL verify products haven't been deactivated since addition to cart
- IF inventory is insufficient for any item, THEN order creation SHALL fail and refund SHALL be processed immediately
- THE system SHALL notify customer of the specific items that became unavailable
- THE system SHALL preserve cart contents allowing customer to remove unavailable items and retry

**Inventory Consistency:**
- THE system SHALL prevent double-selling through atomic database operations
- WHERE two customers simultaneously attempt to buy last unit, THE system SHALL ensure only one succeeds
