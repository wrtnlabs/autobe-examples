# Seller Dashboard Requirements

## Executive Summary

The Seller Dashboard is a comprehensive business management interface that empowers sellers to efficiently manage their e-commerce operations within the shopping mall platform. This dashboard provides real-time visibility into sales performance, inventory status, orders, and business metrics, enabling sellers to make data-driven decisions and optimize their business operations.

The dashboard serves as the central hub for seller-specific operations, including product management, order fulfillment, inventory monitoring, revenue tracking, and customer communication. All dashboard features are strictly scoped to display only the seller's own data, ensuring data isolation and security across the multi-seller platform.

## 1. Seller Dashboard Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Access

THE Seller Dashboard is accessible to authenticated sellers who have completed the onboarding and verification process. The dashboard provides a dedicated business management interface that aggregates all seller-specific operational data and management tools in one accessible location.

WHEN a seller logs into their account, THE system SHALL display the Seller Dashboard with all seller-specific modules and real-time data relevant to their business operations.

THE Seller Dashboard SHALL only display data (products, orders, inventory, metrics) that belongs to the authenticated seller - no visibility into other sellers' information.

WHEN a seller attempts to access another seller's data or modules, THE system SHALL deny access and log the unauthorized access attempt.

### 1.2 Dashboard Layout and Navigation

The Seller Dashboard provides organized navigation to the following primary sections:

1. **Sales Overview** - Quick view of today's sales, recent orders, and key metrics
2. **Products** - Product management and inventory control
3. **Orders** - Order fulfillment and tracking
4. **Inventory** - SKU-level inventory management and alerts
5. **Revenue** - Earnings, commissions, and payment status
6. **Messages** - Customer communication and inquiries
7. **Analytics** - Performance metrics and business insights
8. **Settings** - Seller profile and account configuration

THE system SHALL provide dashboard navigation that is intuitive, role-specific, and organized by major business functions.

WHILE a seller accesses the dashboard, THE system SHALL maintain real-time data updates for all displayed metrics without requiring manual page refresh.

## 10. Data Isolation and Security

### 10.1 Access Control Principles

THE system SHALL enforce strict data isolation to ensure sellers cannot access other sellers' data:

WHEN a seller performs any operation on the dashboard, THE system SHALL verify that:

- The requested data belongs to the authenticated seller (verified against seller ID in JWT token)
- The seller has permission to perform the operation
- If data does not belong to seller, access SHALL be denied immediately and attempt logged

IF a seller attempts to access another seller's data through API or URL manipulation, THEN THE system SHALL:
- Return HTTP 403 Forbidden error
- Log unauthorized access attempt with seller ID, timestamp, attempted resource
- Alert admin if pattern of attempts detected

THE system SHALL maintain data isolation at all levels:

- **Product Data**: Sellers view only their products (filtered by seller_id in database queries)
- **Order Data**: Sellers view only orders containing their products (filtered by seller_id in order_items)
- **Customer Data**: Sellers see only name/contact for customers of their products (no email or personal info beyond what's needed)
- **Inventory Data**: Sellers manage only their SKU inventory (filtered by seller_id)
- **Revenue Data**: Sellers view only their earnings and commissions (no other seller data visible)
- **Message Data**: Sellers communicate only with their customers (filtered by seller_id)
- **Analytics Data**: Analytics calculated only from seller's own data (all aggregations filtered)

### 10.2 Audit Logging

THE system SHALL maintain audit logs for all seller dashboard activities including:

- Product additions (timestamp, seller ID, product ID, product details)
- Product updates (timestamp, seller ID, product ID, what changed)
- Product deletions (timestamp, seller ID, product ID)
- Inventory adjustments (timestamp, seller ID, SKU, old quantity, new quantity, reason)
- Order status changes (timestamp, seller ID, order ID, old status, new status)
- Refund approvals and rejections (timestamp, seller ID, order ID, decision, reason)
- Price changes (timestamp, seller ID, product/SKU ID, old price, new price)
- Account settings modifications (timestamp, seller ID, what changed)
- Message sending (timestamp, seller ID, customer ID, message content)
- Withdrawal requests (timestamp, seller ID, amount, destination)

WHEN an admin needs to investigate seller activities, THE admin SHALL be able to view audit logs for any seller through the admin dashboard (see Admin Dashboard document).

## 11. Business Rules and Validation

### 11.1 Product Management Rules

THE system SHALL enforce these business rules for seller product management:

1. **Sellers can only create products in approved categories** - Sellers cannot create or select categories; only admin-defined categories are available for selection
2. **SKU uniqueness** - Each SKU must be globally unique across platform; system auto-generates SKUs using seller ID + product ID + variant identifier
3. **Price validation** - Product and variant prices must be greater than zero, maximum 2 decimal places, and not exceed 1,000,000
4. **Inventory minimum** - Inventory quantity cannot be negative; system prevents creation of negative stock through validation
5. **Image requirements** - Each product must have at least one image; all images must be valid image format and meet size requirements
6. **Description completeness** - Product name and description are required and must meet length requirements (3-255 for name, 10-5000 for description)

### 11.2 Order Management Rules

THE system SHALL enforce these business rules for seller order management:

1. **Status progression restrictions** - Orders can only transition through defined status paths; sellers cannot arbitrarily change status (Confirmed â†’ Processing â†’ Shipped â†’ Delivered)
2. **Payment validation** - Sellers cannot mark orders as shipped until payment has been received and confirmed (payment_status = "completed")
3. **Cancellation windows** - Sellers can cancel orders only within defined window (e.g., 1 hour after order placed) if not yet confirmed by customer
4. **Refund eligibility** - Sellers can only process refunds for eligible orders (not already refunded, within return window of 30 days from delivery)
5. **Shipment tracking required** - Sellers must provide tracking number and method before marking as shipped (prevent incomplete shipments)

### 11.3 Inventory Rules

THE system SHALL enforce these business rules for inventory management:

1. **Order reservation** - When order is confirmed, inventory is immediately reserved and cannot be sold until order completes or cancels
2. **Overselling prevention** - System prevents inventory from going below currently reserved quantities (available_qty = current_qty - reserved_qty, always >= 0)
3. **Refund restocking** - When refund is approved, inventory is automatically restored (add quantity back to current_qty)
4. **Adjustment audit** - All manual inventory adjustments must have reason recorded for audit trail (reason stored in inventory_adjustments table)

### 11.4 Revenue and Commission Rules

THE system SHALL enforce these business rules for seller revenue:

1. **Commission calculation** - Commissions are calculated per order at time of completion using rate applicable at that time (stored with each order for historical accuracy)
2. **Payout hold period** - Earnings remain "pending" for 3-7 days after order completion before available for withdrawal (prevents chargeback issues)
3. **Minimum withdrawal** - Sellers can only withdraw when pending balance exceeds minimum threshold (e.g., $5 minimum to prevent excessive payment processing)
4. **Instant refunds** - When refund is approved, commission is reversed and refunded to customer immediately

---

## 12. Performance and Operational Requirements

- **Order status**: Update immediately when order status changes (refresh order list within 30 seconds)
- **Message notifications**: Delivered within 1 minute of customer message (real-time notification)
- **Earnings**: Calculate and display within 30 minutes of order completion (batch processing acceptable)

### 12.2 Scalability and Performance

THE system SHALL perform efficiently even with large data volumes:

- Dashboard should load and display within 3 seconds (include all key metrics)
- Product list should display first 50 items within 2 seconds (with pagination)
- Filtering and sorting operations should complete within 2 seconds (on 10,000 products)
- Order search should return results within 3 seconds (query optimization required)
- Analytics charts should render within 5 seconds (may use pre-calculated data)
- Inventory adjustments should process within 1 second (avoid blocking)

### 12.3 Data Consistency

THE system SHALL maintain data consistency across all dashboard views:

- Inventory quantities must be consistent across product view, inventory view, and order management
- Revenue calculations must be consistent across all views and historical records
- Order information must be consistent between seller and customer views
- Message timestamps must be accurate and consistent across all views
- Status information must reflect current state immediately after change
