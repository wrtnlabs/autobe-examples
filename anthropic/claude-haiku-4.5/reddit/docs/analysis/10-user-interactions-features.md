# User Interactions and Features

## 1. User Follow System

### 1.1 Overview
The user follow system enables members to build social connections by following other users. This creates a social graph that supports personalized content discovery, activity tracking, and community building within the platform.

### 1.2 Follow Relationship Mechanics

#### Who Can Follow
WHEN a member attempts to follow another user, THE system SHALL verify the following user account exists and is not the same as the member attempting to follow.

THE system SHALL allow members to follow any other member on the platform (following is unidirectional and does not require mutual agreement).

THE system SHALL allow guests to view follower counts but prevent guests from following users.

#### Follow Limitations
WHEN a member follows another user, THE system SHALL record the follow relationship and update both users' follower/following counts.

THE system SHALL prevent a member from following the same user twice; IF a follow relationship already exists, THE system SHALL reject the follow attempt and return HTTP 409 Conflict with error code `FOLLOW_DUPLICATE`.

WHERE a member's account is suspended or deactivated, THE system SHALL not allow new follows from other members to this account, but existing follows SHALL remain in the database with a "inactive_user" status.

THE system SHALL enforce maximum 10,000 follows per user to prevent abuse of social graph.

#### Unfollow Functionality
WHEN a member initiates an unfollow action on a previously followed user, THE system SHALL remove the follow relationship immediately.

THE system SHALL allow members to unfollow users without any confirmation or cooldown period.

THE system SHALL update follower/following counts immediately upon unfollow with atomic database operation.

THE system SHALL remove any cached relationship data immediately upon unfollow.

### 1.3 Follow Relationship State Management

#### Follow State Tracking
THE system SHALL maintain follow relationships with the following data fields:
- `follow_id`: UUID (unique identifier)
- `follower_id`: UUID (user who follows)
- `following_id`: UUID (user being followed)
- `created_at`: Timestamp (when follow occurred, UTC timezone)
- `relationship_status`: Enum (active, blocked, inactive)

#### Active Follow Status
A follow relationship is "active" when the follower user is not blocked by the following user and both accounts are in good standing.

#### Blocked Follow Status
WHERE a following user blocks the follower user, THE system SHALL change relationship_status to "blocked".

BLOCKED followers cannot view the user's profile or activity.

BLOCKED followers' existing follows remain in database with blocked status but are functionally inactive.

#### Inactive Follow Status
WHERE a following user's account is suspended or deleted, THE system SHALL mark relationship as "inactive".

INACTIVE follows do not appear in follower lists but remain in database for analytics purposes.

#### Following List Management
WHEN a member views their following list, THE system SHALL display all active follow relationships.

THE system SHALL display following list sorted by most recent follows first (newest follows at the top).

THE system SHALL enforce maximum 50 results per page with cursor-based pagination.

WHEN a member has a private profile, THE system SHALL hide their following list from users not following them.

#### Follower List Management
WHEN a member views their follower list, THE system SHALL display all active followers.

THE system SHALL display followers sorted by most recent follows first.

THE system SHALL enforce maximum 50 results per page with cursor-based pagination.

WHEN a member has a private profile, THE system SHALL hide their follower list from non-followers.

#### Follow Suggestions
WHEN a member views the "follow suggestions" or "discover users" feature, THE system SHALL recommend users based on:
- Users followed by people they follow (second-degree connections)
- Users who share similar interests based on community subscriptions (communities in common)
- Highly active users in communities the member frequents (top posters by karma)
- Users with high karma and recent activity (reputation-based recommendations)
- Users in trending communities the member shows interest in

THE system SHALL limit follow suggestions to maximum 20 recommendations per page.

THE system SHALL refresh recommendations daily based on updated activity.

THE system SHALL allow members to dismiss suggestions to reduce similar recommendations for 30 days.

THE system SHALL exclude already-followed users from suggestions.

THE system SHALL exclude the member themselves from suggestions.

THE system SHALL exclude blocked or suspended users from suggestions.

### 1.4 Follow System Performance and Caching

#### Follow Count Caching
THE system SHALL cache follower and following counts on user profiles with 1-hour time-to-live (TTL).

WHEN a follow or unfollow occurs, THE system SHALL invalidate the affected user's cache immediately.

THE system SHALL calculate counts from source-of-truth follow records during cache misses.

THE system SHALL verify cache accuracy weekly by reconciling with database.

#### Follow Relationship Queries
WHEN checking if user A follows user B, THE system SHALL use database index on (follower_id, following_id).

QUERY PERFORMANCE: Must return within 100 milliseconds even with 1 million follow relationships.

#### Bulk Follow Operations
WHEN displaying a feed with 30 posts from 15 different authors, THE system SHALL execute single query to check follow status for all authors.

THE system SHALL batch follow relationship checks to minimize database hits.

## 10. Performance and Scalability Considerations

### 10.1 Real-Time Features Performance

WHEN implementing real-time features (notifications, live feeds):
- THE system SHOULD use efficient database queries with appropriate indexing on (user_id, created_at, timestamp)
- THE system SHOULD cache frequently accessed data (user profiles, follow relationships, statistics)
- THE system SHOULD implement pagination to limit data returned per request
- THE system SHOULD use asynchronous processing for non-critical operations (analytics, recommendations)
- QUERY PERFORMANCE: All critical queries must execute within 500ms

### 10.2 Notification System Performance
THE notification system SHALL:
- Process notifications asynchronously using message queue (don't block request)
- Batch notifications where appropriate (multiple mentions in same comment = 1 notification)
- Archive old notifications (older than 1 year) to separate cold storage
- Index notifications by recipient_id and created_at for efficient querying
- Cache notification counts per user with 5-minute TTL
- Support delivering 10,000+ notifications per second at peak load

### 10.3 Feed Generation Performance
THE feed generation system SHALL:
- Use efficient sorting algorithms (don't sort all posts, use indexed queries)
- Cache feed results with appropriate time-to-live (TTL of 5 minutes for hot/new/top)
- Implement lazy loading to return results quickly (paginated, 30 items per page)
- Use database indexes on (community_id, created_at), (community_id, net_score), (created_at DESC)
- Complete homepage feed generation in < 2 seconds for users with 500+ subscriptions

### 10.4 Engagement Data Storage
THE engagement analytics system SHALL:
- Aggregate detailed metrics to reduce storage requirements (hourly/daily rollups)
- Archive detailed analytics older than 1 year to cold storage
- Use time-series database or optimized storage for metrics (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
- Implement data retention policies compliant with privacy regulations (max 2 years)
- Store only essential engagement events (views, posts, comments, votes) not keystroke logs
- Clean up deleted user's engagement data within 30 days

### 10.5 Cache Invalidation Strategy
THE system SHALL implement smart cache invalidation:
- Invalidate user notification count when new notification arrives
- Invalidate user statistics cache when karma changes
- Invalidate feed cache when new post created in subscribed community
- Invalidate follow suggestion cache when user follows new user
- Use cache versioning/tagging to batch invalidate related caches
- Implement cache warming for frequently accessed data

IF a member attempts to send a direct message to a user who has blocked them, THE system SHALL return HTTP 403 Forbidden with error code `USER_BLOCKED`.

IF a member attempts to mention a non-existent username, THE system SHALL treat it as plain text (not a mention).

IF a member attempts to send a direct message to a suspended/deactivated account, THE system SHALL return HTTP 403 Forbidden with error code `ACCOUNT_INACTIVE`.

IF mention count exceeds 50 mentions per message, THE system SHALL process only first 50 mentions and display warning.

IF follow count exceeds maximum 10,000 follows, THE system SHALL reject new follow with error code `FOLLOW_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

IF direct message exceeds character limit (5000), THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with remaining character count.
