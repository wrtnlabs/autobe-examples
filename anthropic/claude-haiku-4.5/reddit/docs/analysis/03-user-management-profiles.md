# User Management and Profiles

## Overview

The user management and profiles system forms the foundation of user identity and reputation within the community platform. This system enables users to create accounts, establish their online identity, build reputation through community participation, and manage their account settings and preferences. Every member of the platform maintains a profile that displays their contributions, earned karma, and community engagement metrics.

## User Profile Architecture

### Profile Lifecycle

WHEN a user completes registration, THE system SHALL create a new user profile with default values. The profile begins empty and accumulates data as the user interacts with the platform.

WHEN a user logs into their account, THE system SHALL load their profile data and display their current karma, reputation level, and recent activity. The user's profile remains accessible to them at any time through their account dashboard.

WHEN a user account is deleted or suspended, THE system SHALL preserve their historical contributions (posts and comments) but mark the account as inactive and display "[deleted]" as the username on all past content.

### Profile Visibility

THE system SHALL support both public and private profile views. By default, all user profiles are public and searchable by other users. Users can configure their profile visibility settings to restrict who can view their information.

WHEN a user visits another user's profile, THE system SHALL display only information marked as public. Private or restricted information shall not be visible to other users.

WHEN a user views their own profile, THE system SHALL display all profile information including private details, activity history, saved posts, and account settings.

## Profile Information Fields and Data

### Core Profile Fields (All Users)

Each user profile contains the following core information:

| Field | Type | Description | Editable |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| User ID | UUID | Unique system identifier | No |
| Username | String (3-32 chars) | Display name for the user, alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen | Yes (with restrictions) |
| Email | String | Email address used for account, validated format | Restricted |
| Display Name | String (0-50 chars) | Full name or preferred display | Yes |
| Bio | Text (0-500 chars) | User biography or description | Yes |
| Avatar | Image | Profile picture (PNG, JPG, GIF up to 5MB, 200x200px recommended) | Yes |
| Account Created Date | Timestamp | Date and time account was created (ISO 8601 UTC) | No |
| Last Active | Timestamp | Timestamp of last user activity (ISO 8601 UTC) | No (system-managed) |
| Karma Score | Integer | Total reputation points from votes (can be negative) | No (system-calculated) |
| Reputation Level | String | Achievement level based on karma threshold tiers | No (system-calculated) |
| Account Status | String | Active, Suspended, or Deleted | No |
| Preferences | Object | User settings and preferences | Yes |

### Profile Status Values

- **Active**: Normal account in good standing, user can fully participate
- **Suspended**: Account temporarily restricted by moderators or admins, login prevented
- **Deleted**: User-requested or admin-initiated permanent deletion, content marked as deleted

### Username Rules and Restrictions

WHEN a user attempts to create or change their username, THE system SHALL validate that:
- The username is 3-32 characters long
- The username contains only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-)
- The username is unique across the entire platform (case-insensitive comparison)
- The username is not reserved (e.g., "admin", "moderator", "system", "support", "test", "robot")
- The username does not contain profanity or offensive language (checked against profanity filter)

IF the username fails validation, THE system SHALL return a specific error message explaining the validation failure. Users can attempt to choose a different username.

THE system SHALL allow users to change their username, and each change SHALL go into a log for audit purposes. THE system SHALL recommend users not change usernames excessively (recommend once per 30 days maximum).

### Avatar and Image Requirements

WHEN a user uploads an avatar image, THE system SHALL validate that:
- The file is in PNG, JPG, or GIF format (checked by MIME type and file header)
- The file size does not exceed 5 MB
- The image dimensions are between 100x100 and 10000x10000 pixels
- The image file is not corrupted (verified through image processing library)

IF the upload fails validation, THE system SHALL return a specific error message. THE system SHALL automatically resize and optimize the avatar image to 200x200 pixels for storage and display.

THE system SHALL store different sizes of the avatar (thumbnail 50x50, medium 100x100, full size 200x200) for efficient delivery across different contexts (comments, posts, profiles, etc.).

THE system SHALL convert all avatars to JPEG format internally for storage optimization while maintaining quality.

## User Karma System and Reputation

### Karma Definition and Purpose

Karma is a numerical reputation score that reflects the quality and acceptance of a user's contributions to the community. It measures how valuable the community finds a user's posts and comments. Higher karma indicates an active, respected community member whose content is valued by others.

### Karma Calculation Rules

#### Post Karma

WHEN a post receives an upvote, THE system SHALL add one point to the post author's karma.

WHEN a post receives a downvote, THE system SHALL subtract one point from the post author's karma.

THE post's karma contribution to the author is calculated as: **Net Upvotes - Net Downvotes**

Example: A post with 150 upvotes and 50 downvotes generates (150 - 50) = 100 karma points for the author.

WHEN a post is deleted by the author or moderators, THE system SHALL reverse all karma points associated with that post. The author loses the karma they gained from that post.

WHEN the author edits a post, THE system SHALL NOT reset the karma. The post retains all accumulated karma points despite content changes.

#### Comment Karma

WHEN a comment receives an upvote, THE system SHALL add one point to the comment author's karma.

WHEN a comment receives a downvote, THE system SHALL subtract one point from the comment author's karma.

THE comment's karma contribution is calculated identically to posts: **Net Upvotes - Net Downvotes**

WHEN a comment is deleted by the author or moderators, THE system SHALL reverse all karma points associated with that comment.

#### Total User Karma

THE total user karma is calculated as:

**Total Karma = Sum of all post karma + Sum of all comment karma**

This is a running total that changes whenever a user's posts or comments receive votes. The total reflects the cumulative value the community has assigned to all of a user's contributions.

Minimum karma: No lower limit (users can have negative karma such as -1000)
Maximum karma: No upper limit (users can accumulate unlimited positive karma)

#### Karma Calculation Example

User "alice_smith" posts content with the following history:
- Post 1: 50 upvotes, 10 downvotes = 40 karma
- Post 2: 100 upvotes, 5 downvotes = 95 karma
- Comment 1: 30 upvotes, 2 downvotes = 28 karma
- Comment 2: 5 upvotes, 15 downvotes = -10 karma
- Total Karma = 40 + 95 + 28 + (-10) = 153 karma points

### Karma Display

THE system SHALL display a user's karma score prominently on their profile. The karma score is public and visible to all users viewing the profile.

THE system SHALL also display karma breakdowns showing:
- Total karma (sum of all post and comment karma)
- Post karma (sum of all karma from posts only)
- Comment karma (sum of all karma from comments only)
- Karma earned this month (calculated from votes in last 30 days)
- Average karma per post (total post karma divided by number of posts)
- Average karma per comment (total comment karma divided by number of comments)

WHEN displaying karma in post/comment threads, THE system SHALL show the current karma count next to each post or comment. This count updates in real-time as users vote (within 2-5 second delay acceptable).

### Karma Recalculation

THE system SHALL recalculate user karma scores in real-time when:
- A user receives a vote on a post or comment
- A vote is changed or revoked by the voter
- A post or comment is deleted (karma is reversed)
- A post or comment is restored after deletion (karma is restored)
- A user's account status changes (suspension, reactivation)

THE karma calculation SHALL be atomic and consistent. All karma changes are recorded with timestamps for audit and reporting purposes.

### Karma Fraud Prevention

THE system SHALL prevent artificial karma inflation through these mechanisms:

- Users cannot vote on their own posts or comments (IF a user attempts to vote on their own content, THEN THE system SHALL reject the vote with error "You cannot vote on your own content")
- Downvoting does not cost the downvoter any karma (downvotes are free and encouraged for quality control)
- Vote patterns from the same IP address or account are monitored for suspicious activity
- Rapid vote patterns (multiple votes in seconds from same user) are flagged and may be reversed
- Vote clustering (user A only votes for user B's content) is monitored for vote manipulation rings

WHEN suspicious voting patterns are detected, THE system SHALL flag the activity for moderator review and may temporarily restrict voting privileges while under investigation.

## Reputation Levels and Badges

### Reputation Level Tiers

Users earn reputation levels based on accumulated karma. These levels provide visual indicators of user status and engagement:

| Reputation Level | Karma Range | Badge Name | Visual Indicator | Color Code |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Newcomer | 1-99 | Newcomer | 🌱 Seedling | Green |
| Contributor | 100-499 | Contributor | 📝 Document | Blue |
| Active Member | 500-2,499 | Active Member | 🔥 Fire | Orange |
| Community Leader | 2,500-9,999 | Community Leader | ⭐ Star | Gold |
| Respected Elder | 10,000-49,999 | Respected Elder | 👑 Crown | Purple |
| Legend | 50,000+ | Legend | 🏆 Trophy | Red |

THE system SHALL automatically assign reputation levels based on a user's total karma. WHEN a user's karma crosses a tier threshold, THE system SHALL update their reputation level immediately.

THE reputation level is displayed on the user's profile, in posts and comments they create, and in community member lists.

### Achievement Badges

Beyond reputation levels, users can earn specific achievement badges for exceptional community participation:

| Badge Name | Requirement | Trigger Condition | Display Location |
|------------|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Verified Email | Email verified | Upon email verification completion | Profile badge area |
| First Post | 1+ posts created | When user creates first post | Profile, post author info |
| Commenter | 10+ comments | When comment count reaches 10 | Profile badge area |
| Post Master | 100+ posts | When post count reaches 100 | Profile badge area |
| Discussion Star | 1,000+ comment karma | When comment karma hits 1,000 | Profile badge area |
| Content Creator | 1,000+ post karma | When post karma hits 1,000 | Profile badge area |
| Decade Member | Account age > 10 years | Automatic on 10-year anniversary | Profile badge area |
| Helpful | 10,000+ total karma | When total karma reaches 10,000 | Profile badge area, posts |
| Moderator | Appointed as moderator | When moderator role assigned | Profile, comments in moderated communities |
| Admin | System administrator | When admin role assigned | Profile, all platform content |

Badges are displayed on user profiles and serve as visual representations of user achievement and engagement.

WHEN a user earns a new badge, THE system SHALL award the badge automatically without user action.

WHEN a user's karma drops below the threshold required for their current reputation level, THE system SHALL update their displayed badge to the appropriate lower level.

## Profile Visibility and Privacy Settings

### Privacy Levels

Users can configure their profile visibility through privacy settings:

| Privacy Level | Description | Visibility Scope | Who Can Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public | Profile fully visible to all users | Username, karma, posts, comments, bio, avatar, followers, following | All guests and members |
| Members Only | Profile visible only to registered users | Same as public, hidden from guests | Registered members and admins |
| Private | Profile visible only to self | Full details hidden from others | Only account owner and admins |
| Custom | User selects specific fields to hide | Configurable per field | User-defined access rules |

THE default privacy level is "Public" to encourage community interaction and visibility.

WHEN a user sets their profile to Private, THE system SHALL hide their profile from all users except themselves and administrators.

WHEN a user sets their profile to Members Only, THE system SHALL require authentication to view their profile but allow all authenticated users to view.

### Specific Field Privacy Options

Users can configure visibility for these specific fields independently:

- Email address (always hidden from public; only shown to moderators/admins if needed for enforcement)
- Account creation date (timestamp when account was created)
- Last active timestamp (when user last accessed the platform)
- Activity history and timeline (posts, comments, voting history)
- Posts and comments (can hide all or show only with content warnings)
- Karma score (can hide total but user still earns karma internally)
- Location or website information (if added to profile)
- Followers/Following lists (can hide who follows/is following the user)

WHEN a user sets a field to private, THE system SHALL not display that information to other users (except moderators/admins for policy enforcement purposes).

### Profile Visibility to Different User Types

WHEN a guest (unauthenticated user) views a profile, THE system SHALL display only public information that has been explicitly marked as visible to non-members.

WHEN a registered member views another member's profile, THE system SHALL display information based on that profile owner's privacy settings.

WHEN a moderator views a profile, THE system SHALL display all profile information including private details for moderation purposes.

WHEN an admin views a profile, THE system SHALL display all profile information and additional system data (IP addresses, payment info if applicable, moderation history).

## Profile Management and Editing

### Profile Editing Features

Users can edit their profile through the account settings interface. The following fields are editable:

| Field | Rules | Restrictions | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------|
| Display Name | 0-50 characters, letters/numbers/spaces/punctuation | Optional; can differ from username | Shows on profile and next to posts |
| Bio | 0-500 characters | Markdown formatting allowed (bold, italic, links) | Displayed in profile header |
| Avatar | PNG, JPG, GIF; max 5MB; 100x100 to 2000x2000 px | System resizes to multiple dimensions | Used in posts, comments, profile |
| Website URL | Valid URL format; max 100 characters | Must start with http:// or https:// | Optional personal or professional link |
| Location | Free text; max 100 characters | Optional text or emoji allowed | Optional location information |
| Privacy Settings | Public/Members/Private/Custom | Each field has independent toggle | Controls profile visibility |
| Notification Preferences | Various toggles and dropdowns | Email, in-app, push (if applicable) | Configures notification behavior |

### Profile Update Workflow

WHEN a user submits profile changes, THE system SHALL:

1. Validate all input fields against specified rules (character limits, format, content)
2. IF validation fails, return specific error messages for each invalid field
3. IF validation passes, update the profile in the database
4. Record the change timestamp for audit purposes
5. Notify the user of successful update with summary of changes
6. Return success confirmation and updated profile view

THE system SHALL prevent excessively frequent profile updates (recommend limit of 1 update per 5 minutes) to prevent spam and abuse.

WHEN a user updates their profile, THE system SHALL immediately reflect changes across the platform (no caching delay for profile updates).

### Display Name vs Username

THE username is the unique identifier used for account login and system references. It is rarely changed and subject to restrictions.

THE display name is a separate field that users can change freely to show a preferred display name different from their login username. Both are shown on profiles and content.

Example:
- Username: "user_12345" (for login, used in @mentions)
- Display Name: "John Smith" (displayed on profile and next to posts)

### Avatar Management

WHEN a user uploads a new avatar, THE system SHALL:

1. Validate the image file (format, size, dimensions)
2. IF invalid, return specific validation error
3. IF valid, optimize and resize the image:
   - Crop/resize to 200x200 pixels for profile display
   - Generate thumbnail (50x50) for comment threads and micro (30x30) for mentions
4. Store all sizes efficiently
5. Replace the previous avatar
6. Return success confirmation and preview of new avatar

WHEN a user removes their avatar, THE system SHALL display a default avatar or placeholder image (gray circle with user initials).

WHEN displaying avatar in different contexts, THE system SHALL use appropriately sized version:
- 30x30: Mention notifications, small lists
- 50x50: Comment author info, notification preview
- 100x100: Post author, profile sidebars
- 200x200: Profile page main display

## User Activity History and Timeline

### Activity Tracking

THE system SHALL track all user activities and maintain a complete history. Tracked activities include:

- Posts created (with timestamp, title, community)
- Comments posted (with timestamp, parent post/comment reference)
- Votes cast (tracked internally but not displayed publicly for privacy)
- Communities joined/subscribed (with timestamp)
- Content saved/bookmarked (if applicable)
- Account changes (login, password change, email change, settings updates - for security audit)

WHEN tracking activities, THE system SHALL record:
- Activity type (post created, comment, vote, etc.)
- Content ID (what was interacted with)
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 UTC)
- Content context (community, post title, etc.)

### User Activity Display

WHEN viewing a user profile, THE system SHALL display an activity timeline showing recent posts and comments in chronological order (newest first).

THE timeline SHALL display:
- Content type (post or comment)
- Content title or excerpt (first 100 characters)
- Community name (with icon if available)
- Number of upvotes/downvotes
- Publication timestamp (relative: "2 hours ago", absolute: "Nov 15, 2024 2:30 PM")
- Engagement metrics (comment count for posts, reply count for comments)

THE timeline SHALL show maximum 20 items per page with pagination support.

WHEN a user visits their own profile, THE system SHALL display more detailed activity including:
- All recent posts and comments with full text
- Communities they've joined with subscription date
- Account activity log (logins, settings changes) for security
- Saved posts and comments (if applicable)
- Voting activity (private, visible only to self)

### Public vs Private Activity

Most user activity is public and visible to all users viewing that user's profile. Vote history is NOT publicly displayed (users do not see what other users have upvoted/downvoted).

Private activities (like saved posts, voting history, account security logs) are visible only to the user themselves and administrators.

## Account Settings and Preferences

- Maximum 128 characters

WHEN a user wants to change their password, THE system SHALL:

1. Require the user to enter their current password for verification
2. Validate the new password meets all requirements
3. IF valid, update the password and log the user out of all other sessions
4. Send confirmation email to the user's registered email address
5. Display success message: "Password changed successfully"

WHEN a user forgets their password, THE system SHALL provide a password reset flow:

1. User enters their email address
2. System verifies email is registered (without revealing if exists)
3. System sends a password reset link (valid for 24 hours) to their email
4. User clicks the link and sets a new password
5. System confirms the reset and logs user in
6. Send confirmation email: "Your password has been reset"

THE system SHALL rate limit password reset requests to 5 per email address per 24 hours to prevent abuse.

### Email Verification

WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL send a verification email to their provided email address containing a verification link (valid for 24 hours).

IF the user does not verify their email within 24 hours, THE system SHALL send a reminder email with a new link.

IF the user does not verify within 7 days, THE system SHALL suspend account activity (cannot post/comment) but preserve the account for re-verification.

WHEN a user verifies their email, THE system SHALL:

1. Mark the email as verified
2. Update user's email verification status
3. Restore full account functionality if previously suspended for non-verification
4. Send confirmation: "Your email has been verified"

1. Restore all account functionality
2. Update account status to "Active"
3. Send notification: "Your account has been reactivated"
4. Preserve all historical data and statistics
5. Resume karma calculations if applicable

## User Authentication Integration with Profiles

THE user profile system integrates with the authentication system. Upon successful login:

1. System retrieves the user's profile data
2. Updates the last active timestamp to current time
3. Loads user preferences and notification settings
4. Displays profile information in the user interface
5. Initializes user-specific settings (language, timezone, etc.)

WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL maintain their profile data and history for their next login.

WHEN a user has multiple active sessions (logged in from different devices), THE system SHALL maintain separate session records but a single unified profile. All profile updates immediately reflect across all sessions.

## Profile Search and Discovery

THE system SHALL support searching for user profiles by username. WHEN a user searches for a profile:

1. System returns matching usernames (case-insensitive, substring matching)
2. Results show username, display name, reputation level, and bio excerpt (first 100 characters)
3. Results are ranked by: exact match first, then popularity (followers/karma)
4. Users can click a result to view the full profile

IF a profile is set to private or hidden, THE system SHALL not include it in search results (except to that user themselves).

WHEN searching, THE system SHALL:
- Return results within 1 second
- Display maximum 20 results per page
- Support pagination for additional results
- Highlight matching terms in results

## Error Handling for Profile Operations

### Validation Errors

IF a user provides invalid input when editing their profile (e.g., bio exceeds 500 characters), THE system SHALL:

1. Return a specific error message explaining the validation failure
2. Identify the problematic field clearly
3. Suggest corrections or limits (e.g., "Bio must be 500 characters or less. Current: 650 characters")
4. Preserve the user's input so they can fix it without re-entering everything
5. Show character counter in real-time as user types

### Conflict Errors

IF a user attempts to change their username to one that is already taken, THE system SHALL:

1. Return error: "Username is already in use. Please choose a different username."
2. Suggest similar available usernames using fuzzy matching algorithm
3. Allow user to check availability of alternative usernames

IF a user attempts to change their email to one already in use, THE system SHALL:

1. Return error: "This email is already associated with another account."
2. Display: "Use a different email or log in to your existing account if this is your email"

### Permission Errors

IF a guest user attempts to edit a profile, THE system SHALL:

1. Redirect to login page
2. Display message: "You must be logged in to edit your profile"

IF a user attempts to edit another user's profile, THE system SHALL:

1. Return error: "You don't have permission to edit this profile"
2. Display only: Profile owner can edit their own profile

IF a user without permission attempts to view private profile data, THE system SHALL:

1. Return limited public information
2. Display "Profile is private" message
3. Offer option to request to follow (if follow system exists)

### Rate Limiting Errors

IF a user attempts to update their profile too frequently (more than once per 5 minutes), THE system SHALL:

1. Return error: "Please wait before making another profile update"
2. Indicate when the next update will be allowed (display countdown)
3. Queue the request or reject it based on implementation

### Account Status Errors

IF a suspended user attempts to view or edit their profile, THE system SHALL:

1. Display: "Your account has been suspended. Reason: [reason]"
2. Prevent all profile edits
3. Allow viewing of own profile (read-only)

## Data Consistency and Backup

THE system SHALL maintain data consistency for user profiles:

- All profile updates are atomic transactions (all-or-nothing)
- Karma calculations are always consistent with vote records
- Profile deletion cascades appropriately (but preserves content with [deleted] marker)
- Backups are maintained for disaster recovery and account recovery requests
- Version control tracks all profile changes for audit trail

WHEN backing up profile data, THE system SHALL:
- Include all profile fields and historical data
- Preserve complete edit history
- Maintain referential integrity (karma records, activity logs)
- Support point-in-time recovery (restore to any previous state within 90 days)

WHEN recovering from backup, THE system SHALL:
- Verify data integrity before restoration
- Update timestamps appropriately
- Notify user of recovery completion
- Preserve any changes made after backup point (if applicable)
