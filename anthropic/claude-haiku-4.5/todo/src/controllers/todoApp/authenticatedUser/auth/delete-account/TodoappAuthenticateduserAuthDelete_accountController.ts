   * Delete authenticated user account and associated todos with 30-day
   * recovery period.
   *
   * Permanently delete the authenticated user's account and all associated
   * todo data from the application. This operation implements soft delete
   * with a 30-day recovery window before permanent data purge.
   *
   * WHEN an authenticated user submits an account deletion request, THE
   * system SHALL verify the user's identity and require explicit
   * confirmation. THE system SHALL mark the user account as deleted by
   * setting the deleted_at timestamp to the current UTC time. The user's
   * email address is released and can be registered by other users
   * immediately, while the account data itself remains in the database for 30
   * days allowing restoration.
   *
   * During the 30-day recovery period, deleted users cannot log in, and their
   * todos are not visible in normal application operations. However, users
   * can restore their complete account including all todos through a recovery
   * link sent to their registered email address. After 30 days have elapsed,
   * the system SHALL automatically and permanently purge all account data,
   * associated todos, audit logs, and security events related to the deleted
   * account.
   *
   * This operation has critical privacy and compliance implications. The
   * system SHALL create comprehensive audit logs documenting the deletion
   * request, user confirmation, deletion timestamp, and scheduled permanent
   * purge date. Security events are recorded to support regulatory compliance
   * and investigations. Users receive notification emails at deletion time
   * and 25-day warning emails before permanent purge if they haven't
   * recovered their account.
   *
   * The deletion affects multiple related entities: the user account itself,
   * all todos owned by the user, all security events and audit logs
   * associated with the user, and all session tokens. All references are
   * properly cascaded to maintain data integrity. Failed deletion attempts
   * are logged and the user is informed with recovery options.
