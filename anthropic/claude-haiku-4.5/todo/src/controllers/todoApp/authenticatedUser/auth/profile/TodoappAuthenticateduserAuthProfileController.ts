   * Retrieve authenticated user profile information.
   *
   * This operation retrieves the complete profile information of the
   * currently authenticated user. The endpoint returns comprehensive user
   * account details associated with the todo_app_authenticateduser table,
   * including email address, first name, last name, account status, email
   * verification status, last login timestamp, account creation timestamp,
   * and account modification timestamp.
   *
   * The operation is read-only and does not modify any user data. Only the
   * authenticated user can retrieve their own profile information. WHEN an
   * authenticated user requests their profile, THE system SHALL return all
   * profile fields for that user. WHEN a user attempts to retrieve another
   * user's profile, THE system SHALL deny access with authorization error.
   *
   * Security considerations include authentication verification before
   * profile retrieval. The system SHALL verify that the requesting user has a
   * valid JWT token or authentication session. WHEN a user's session token is
   * expired or invalid, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized and
   * require re-authentication.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the todo_app_authenticateduser table from
   * the Prisma schema, returning only fields relevant to user profile display
   * and management. The response includes account lifecycle information
   * (creation time, last login) and account status information
   * (active/inactive/locked status) that users need for account management
   * decisions.
   *
   * Related operations include PUT /auth/profile for updating profile
   * information and DELETE /auth/profile (future enhancement) for account
   * deletion requests. Users may call GET /auth/profile before PUT
   * /auth/profile to retrieve current values for editing, or to verify their
   * current account information is correct.

  /**
   * Update authenticated user profile information.
   *
   * This operation updates the profile information of the currently
   * authenticated user. The endpoint accepts updates to user account details
   * stored in the todo_app_authenticateduser table, including email address,
   * first name, and last name fields. The operation validates all submitted
   * data before applying updates to ensure data integrity and consistency.
   *
   * Authentication and authorization verification is required before
   * processing updates. WHEN an authenticated user submits profile update
   * request, THE system SHALL verify the user's authentication status and
   * authorization to modify their own profile. WHEN a user attempts to update
   * another user's profile, THE system SHALL deny access with HTTP 403
   * Forbidden authorization error.
   *
   * The operation validates email address format and uniqueness before
   * applying updates. WHEN a user updates their email address, THE system
   * SHALL verify the new email follows RFC 5321 standard format. THE system
   * SHALL check that the new email is not already registered to another
   * account. WHEN email validation fails, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400
   * Bad Request with specific validation error message.
   *
   * Name field validation ensures data quality. WHEN a user submits first
   * name or last name, THE system SHALL validate that field length does not
   * exceed reasonable limits (typically 100 characters). THE system SHALL
   * accept any UTF-8 characters in name fields including international
   * characters and accents.
   *
   * The operation updates the modified timestamp (updated_at) to current UTC
   * time upon successful update. The account creation timestamp (created_at)
   * remains immutable. Success response returns HTTP 200 OK with complete
   * updated profile data reflecting all changes. The system automatically
   * logs the profile modification for audit trail compliance.
   *
   * Related operations include GET /auth/profile for retrieving current
   * profile before editing, and authentication endpoints for changing
   * password or verifying email separately. Users typically call GET
   * /auth/profile first to retrieve current values, then submit PUT
   * /auth/profile with modified values.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body User profile update information including email, first name,
   *   and last name fields
