  /**
   * Create a new todo with a title and optional description.
   *
   * This operation enables authenticated users to create new todos by
   * submitting a POST request with required title and optional description
   * fields. The system performs comprehensive validation on the title field
   * ensuring it is provided, non-empty, contains no whitespace-only content,
   * and falls within the 1-255 character length requirement. Upon successful
   * validation, the system automatically generates a unique UUID identifier
   * for the todo, sets the initial completion status to false (incomplete),
   * records the current UTC timestamp as both creation and modification time,
   * and associates the todo with the authenticated user.
   *
   * The todo is immediately persisted to the database with full ACID
   * compliance ensuring atomicity and consistency. The system implements
   * transaction-based storage ensuring either the complete todo is created
   * with all properties or the operation fails cleanly without partial state.
   * The response returns HTTP 201 (Created) status code along with the
   * complete todo object including all assigned properties.
   *
   * Data validation enforces these business rules: title field is mandatory
   * and cannot be null, empty string, or contain only whitespace characters;
   * title length must be between 1 and 255 characters inclusive; description
   * field is optional with maximum 2000 characters. The system trims leading
   * and trailing whitespace from titles before validation for seamless user
   * experience.
   *
   * Authorization is automatically enforced through the authenticated user
   * context - the created todo is always associated with the user making the
   * request using their unique user ID from the authentication token. Users
   * cannot create todos for other users or without user association. The
   * system maintains strict data ownership ensuring each user can only access
   * and manage todos they created.
   *
   * Error scenarios include validation failures (empty title, excessive
   * length), network interruptions during save, and database errors. For
   * transient failures, the system automatically retries up to 3 times with
   * exponential backoff. User input is preserved in temporary storage for
   * retry capability, preventing data loss during error conditions. Failed
   * operations return appropriate HTTP status codes with user-friendly error
   * messages explaining what went wrong and suggested corrective actions.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Request payload containing todo creation data with required
   *   title and optional description fields

  /**
   * Retrieve a specific todo by its unique identifier.
   *
   * This operation enables authenticated users to retrieve detailed
   * information about a specific todo they own by providing the todo's unique
   * identifier in the request path. The system receives the todoId parameter,
   * validates it as a valid UUID format, and queries the persistent storage
   * layer to locate the corresponding todo record.
   *
   * Authorization verification occurs before data retrieval, implementing
   * strict ownership checks. The system compares the authenticated user's ID
   * (from authentication token) against the requested todo's owner. If the
   * user does not own the todo, the system returns HTTP 403 (Forbidden) error
   * with message 'You do not have permission to access this todo'.
   * Critically, the system returns the same error response whether the todo
   * does not exist or the user lacks ownership, preventing user enumeration
   * attacks where attackers could determine which todos exist in the system
   * by analyzing error responses.
   *
   * Upon successful authorization verification, the system retrieves the
   * complete todo record including all properties: unique identifier (UUID),
   * title text, optional description, completion status (boolean), creation
   * timestamp in ISO 8601 UTC format, and last modification timestamp. The
   * response returns HTTP 200 (OK) status code with the complete todo object
   * as JSON payload.
   *
   * Data integrity is maintained throughout retrieval - the system returns
   * the exact current state of the todo as stored in the database, reflecting
   * any recent updates from other operations. Timestamps are preserved with
   * millisecond precision for accurate change tracking. The operation is
   * read-only and does not modify any data or state.
   *
   * Error scenarios include invalid UUID format for todoId (returns HTTP 400
   * Bad Request with validation error), todo not found or unauthorized
   * (returns HTTP 403 Forbidden with generic authorization error), and
   * database retrieval failures (returns HTTP 500 Server Error with recovery
   * guidance). For transient database errors, the system implements automatic
   * retry with exponential backoff, attempting recovery transparently without
   * blocking the user.

   * @param connection
   * @param todoId Unique identifier of the specific todo to retrieve, in UUID
