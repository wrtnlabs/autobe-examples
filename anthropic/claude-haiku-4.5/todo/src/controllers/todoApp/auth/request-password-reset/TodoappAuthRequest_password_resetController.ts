  /**
   * Request password reset token to be sent to registered email address.
   *
   * This operation initiates the password reset workflow for users who have
   * forgotten their password or need to reset it. The operation handles the
   * first step: validating the user's email address and issuing a
   * time-limited password reset token.
   *
   * WHEN a user submits their email address through this endpoint, THE system
   * SHALL:
   *
   * 1. Validate that an email address has been provided and is in valid format
   *    (RFC 5321)
   * 2. Use constant-time operations to search the todo_app_authenticateduser
   *    table for an account matching the provided email
   * 3. Generate a cryptographically secure password reset token (minimum 256-bit
   *    entropy, 32+ characters, Base64 URL-safe encoded)
   * 4. Set token expiration to 1 hour (3600 seconds) from generation time
   * 5. Store the token securely in external key-value store (Redis/Memcached) or
   *    temporary token table (todo_app_password_reset_tokens) with fields:
   *    token_hash, user_id, email_address, token_expires_at
   * 6. Compose a password reset email containing: secure reset link with token,
   *    token expiration time, warning about unsolicited requests, support
   *    contact information
   * 7. Send email to the registered address from no-reply address with clear
   *    branding
   * 8. Apply rate limiting: maximum 3 password reset requests per email address
   *    per 15 minutes; return HTTP 429 if exceeded
   *
   * WHEN email is not found OR found, THE system SHALL display identical
   * response message: "If an account exists for this email, you will receive
   * a password reset email shortly. Please check your inbox and spam
   * folder."
   *
   * THE system SHALL use constant-time operations or introduce random delays
   * (50-500ms) to ensure response time is identical whether the email exists
   * in the system or not, preventing timing-based user enumeration attacks
   * where attackers measure response times to enumerate valid email
   * addresses.
   *
   * The password reset email SHALL contain a secure link that directs the
   * user to a password reset page with the token pre-filled. The user then
   * submits their new password through the POST /todoApp/auth/reset-password
   * endpoint to complete the password reset.
   *
   * This operation does not directly reset the password; it only validates
   * and initiates the reset workflow. This prevents:
   *
   * - Unauthorized password resets through enumeration attacks
   * - Account takeover by attackers guessing email addresses
   * - Direct password resets without email confirmation
   * - Timing-based user enumeration
   *
   * The reset token is single-use and expires after 1 hour for security.
   * Multiple reset requests will generate new tokens, invalidating previous
   * tokens. Upon successful password reset through the reset endpoint, the
   * user can log in with their new password and regain access to their todo
   * list.
