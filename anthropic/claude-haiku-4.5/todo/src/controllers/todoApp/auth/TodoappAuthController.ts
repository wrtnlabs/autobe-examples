   *
   * Authenticate existing user account by providing email and password
   * credentials matching registered account. THE system SHALL verify email
   * exists in todo_app_authenticateduser table by querying on email field
   * using case-insensitive comparison. THE system SHALL validate password by
   * hashing submitted password using same bcrypt algorithm and salt as stored
   * password_hash, then comparing computed hash to stored hash value. THE
   * system SHALL verify account status equals 'active' preventing login with
   * inactive or locked accounts. THE system SHALL verify email_verified flag
   * is true, requiring email verification before login access. THE system
   * SHALL check locked_until timestamp is null or in past, denying login if
   * account currently locked.
   *
   * Upon successful authentication after all validations pass, THE system
   * SHALL:
   *
   * 1. Generate JWT access token containing userId from
   *    todo_app_authenticateduser.id, email address,
   *    role='authenticatedUser', iat set to current Unix timestamp, exp set
   *    to iat + 900 seconds (15 minutes), tokenType='access'
   * 2. Sign token using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm with secure cryptographic key
   * 3. Reset failed_login_attempts counter to 0 for the user
   * 4. Update last_login_at timestamp on user record to current UTC time
   * 5. Return HTTP 200 (OK) with token and user details
   * 6. Log successful authentication in todo_app_audit_logs with
   *    action_type='LOGIN', operation_status='SUCCESS'
   *
   * The issued JWT token SHALL be transmitted to client via httpOnly secure
   * cookie (preferred for security) or in response body for client-side
   * storage. Client SHALL include token in Authorization header of all
   * subsequent requests as 'Bearer [token]' for authentication. Token
   * automatically expires after 15 minutes requiring re-authentication.
   *
   * For failed authentication, THE system SHALL track attempt in
   * todo_app_failed_login_attempts with email_address, failure_reason
   * ('INVALID_EMAIL' or 'INVALID_PASSWORD'), ip_address, and
   * attempt_number_in_window calculated as count of failures for this email
   * in last 15 minutes. After 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes, THE system
   * SHALL set locked_until to current time + 15 minutes on
   * todo_app_authenticateduser record and update lockout_status in
   * failed_login_attempts to 'LOCKED'. THE system SHALL return HTTP 401
   * (Unauthorized) with error message 'Invalid email or password' for both
   * invalid email and invalid password to prevent user enumeration. THE
   * system SHALL return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) if account currently
   * locked with message indicating lockout period remaining.
   *
   * Generic error message 'Invalid email or password' is used intentionally
   * for both email not found and password mismatch scenarios. This prevents
   * attackers from determining which accounts exist in the system, protecting
   * user privacy and security. THE system logs failure_reason internally
   * ('INVALID_EMAIL' vs 'INVALID_PASSWORD') for administrator analysis and
   * security monitoring, but this distinction is never revealed to the
   * requesting user.

   * security through token expiration and rotation.
   *
   * WHEN an authenticated user's access token approaches expiration or has
   * expired, THE user can submit their refresh token to obtain a new access
   * token. THE system SHALL validate the refresh token to ensure it is valid,

   * attacks). THE refresh token must match the user's current session

   *
   * WHEN an authenticated user chooses to logout, THE system SHALL invalidate
   * their current access token immediately. THE system SHALL also revoke any
   * associated refresh tokens to prevent token reuse. THE server marks the
   * tokens as revoked in security event logs for forensic and compliance
   * audit trail purposes.

   * session. The logout operation is protected by the current access token
   * requirement, preventing unauthorized session termination by
   * unauthenticated users.
   *
   * **SECURITY CONSIDERATION**: To properly enforce logout server-side
   * (prevent token reuse after logout), implement token revocation checking
   * in authentication middleware. With current implementation, this requires
   * a token storage table. Without revocation enforcement, logout removes
   * client tokens but server continues accepting the token until natural
   * 15-minute expiration.
