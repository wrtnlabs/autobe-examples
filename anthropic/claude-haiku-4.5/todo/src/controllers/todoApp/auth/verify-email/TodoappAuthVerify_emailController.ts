  /**
   * Verify user email address with verification token to complete account
   * registration.
   *
   * This operation processes email verification for newly registered user
   * accounts. When a user completes registration, THE system SHALL send a
   * verification email containing a unique time-limited token. THE user
   * clicks the verification link containing this token and submits it through
   * this endpoint.
   *
   * WHEN a user submits a valid verification token, THE system SHALL:
   *
   * 1. Validate that the token format is correct and matches expected format
   *    (32+ character Base64-encoded string)
   * 2. Check that the token has not expired (24 hours validity from generation)
   * 3. Verify that the token maps to an existing user account awaiting email
   *    verification
   * 4. Confirm the associated email address has not been verified previously
   * 5. Update the user's email_verified field to true in
   *    todo_app_authenticateduser
   * 6. Record the verification timestamp in email_verified_at (current UTC time)
   * 7. Invalidate/delete the token from external storage to prevent reuse
   * 8. Return success response enabling user to proceed to login
   *
   * WHEN validation fails, THE system SHALL display appropriate error
   * message:
   *
   * - Invalid token format: "TODOAPP-VAL-009: Verification link is invalid or
   *   malformed. Please check the link and try again."
   * - Token expired: "TODOAPP-AUTH-005: Verification link has expired. Please
   *   request a new verification email from your account settings."
   * - Token does not exist or already used: "TODOAPP-AUTH-006: This
   *   verification link has already been used or is no longer valid. Please
   *   log in directly or request a new verification link."
   * - User account not found: "TODOAPP-AUTH-007: User account not found. Please
   *   register first."
   * - Email already verified: "TODOAPP-AUTH-008: This email has already been
   *   verified. You can log in directly."
   *
   * Email verification tokens are stored in external key-value store
   * (Redis/Memcached) or temporary token table
   * (todo_app_email_verification_tokens) with fields: token_hash, user_id,
   * email_address, token_expires_at. Tokens are cryptographically secure
   * (minimum 256-bit entropy), Base64 URL-safe encoded, and single-use. Upon
   * successful verification, the token is immediately deleted from storage.
   *
   * This email verification step is MANDATORY before users can log in and
   * access their todo list. This protects against invalid email addresses and
   * confirms the user controls the email account used for registration. Upon
   * successful verification, the user can immediately log in with their
   * registered credentials and begin managing their todos.
