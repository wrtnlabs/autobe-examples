   * Request password reset token for forgotten password recovery.
   *
   * This operation initiates the password reset process for users who have
   * forgotten their password. When an authenticated or unauthenticated user
   * submits their email address, THE system SHALL verify that an account with
   * that email exists in the todo_app_authenticateduser table. If the account
   * exists, THE system SHALL generate a cryptographically secure,
   * time-limited reset token valid for exactly 24 hours and store it in a
   * secure temporary storage or token table.
   *
   * THE system SHALL send a password reset email to the provided email
   * address containing a secure link that includes the reset token. The email
   * MUST be sent immediately upon successful token generation. THE system
   * SHALL display a confirmation message to the user indicating that if the
   * email address is associated with an account, a password reset link will
   * be sent shortly.
   *
   * For security purposes, THE system SHALL use the same response message
   * whether the email exists or not, preventing user enumeration attacks.
   * This means the system returns success message for both valid and invalid
   * email addresses to prevent attackers from determining which emails are
   * registered.
   *
   * The reset token MUST be cryptographically random, sufficiently long
   * (minimum 32 characters), and stored separately from the user password
   * hash. THE token SHALL be marked with creation time and expiration time
   * (24 hours after creation) to enforce time-limited validity. Once a user
   * uses the token to reset their password, THE system SHALL immediately
   * invalidate the token preventing reuse.
   *
   * If the system cannot send the email due to mail server issues, THE system
   * SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1 second, 2 seconds,
   * 4 seconds). If all retry attempts fail, THE system SHALL log the failure
   * for administrator investigation and display message 'Unable to send reset
   * email. Please try again later or contact support.' to the user.
   *
   * This operation is GUEST/UNAUTHENTICATED accessible since users requesting
   * password reset may not have valid sessions. THE operation integrates with
   * the todo_app_authenticateduser table to verify email existence and store
   * reset token state.
