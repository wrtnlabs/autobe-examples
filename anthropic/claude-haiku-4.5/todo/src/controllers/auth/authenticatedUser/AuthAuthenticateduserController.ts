   * meets security requirements: minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase
   * letter, one lowercase letter, one numeric digit, and one special
   * character. THE system SHALL reject duplicate email addresses with error
   * 'This email is already registered' and reject weak passwords with
   * specific error messages indicating missing requirement.
   *
   * WHEN all validations pass, THE system SHALL create a new user account in
   * the todo_app_authenticateduser table with: user email address, securely
   * hashed and salted password (using bcrypt with minimum 10 rounds), account
   * status set to 'inactive' until email verification, email_verified flag
   * set to false, account creation timestamp, and unique user ID (UUID).
   *
   * THE system SHALL generate a time-limited email verification token (valid
   * 24 hours) and send verification email to registered address. User MUST
   * verify email within 24 hours to fully activate account and be able to log
   * in. THE system SHALL return success response with user ID and message
   * 'Registration successful. Verification email sent to [email]. Please
   * verify your email to complete registration.'

   * WHEN a user submits a refresh token to obtain a new access token
   * (typically when current access token is about to expire or has expired),
   * THE system SHALL validate the refresh token's signature using the same
   * secret key used for generation. THE system SHALL verify refresh token has
