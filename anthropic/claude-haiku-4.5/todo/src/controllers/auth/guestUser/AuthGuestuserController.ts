   * Register a new guest user account with email and password credentials.

   * This endpoint allows unregistered guest users to create a new account by
   * providing email and password credentials. The registration process
   * includes comprehensive input validation, password strength enforcement,
   * email uniqueness verification, and account creation in the
   * todo_app_authenticateduser table.
   *
   * WHEN a guest user submits a registration request with email and password,
   * THE system SHALL validate the email follows RFC 5321 standard format and
   * is not already registered in the database. THE system SHALL validate the
   * password meets minimum 8 characters, includes uppercase letter, lowercase
   * letter, numeric digit, and special character. THE system SHALL create a
   * new todo_app_authenticateduser record with hashed and salted password
   * (minimum 10 bcrypt rounds), setting status to 'active', email_verified to
   * false, and created_at/updated_at to current UTC timestamp.
   *
   * THE system SHALL NOT store passwords in plaintext and SHALL use bcrypt or
   * Argon2 for secure hashing. THE system SHALL generate unique verification
   * email with time-limited token (24-hour expiration) and send to registered
   * email address. THE system SHALL return HTTP 201 with newly created user
   * object containing user ID, email, account status, and email verification
   * status.
   *
   * IF email already exists in database, THE system SHALL return HTTP 409
   * Conflict with error 'Email already registered'. IF password fails
   * strength validation, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with
   * specific error message indicating which requirement failed (e.g.,
   * 'Password must contain uppercase letter'). IF email format invalid, THE
   * system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with error 'Invalid email
   * format'. THE system SHALL NOT reveal whether email exists or not during
   * validation to prevent user enumeration.

   * Refresh expired access token using valid refresh token.
   *
   * This endpoint allows authenticated users to refresh their access tokens
   * without submitting email/password credentials. The refresh process
   * accepts a valid refresh token, validates its signature and expiration,
   * and issues a new short-lived access token with 15-minute expiration if
   * validation succeeds.
   *
   * WHEN a user submits a refresh token request, THE system SHALL extract the
   * refresh token from request (typically from httpOnly cookie or
   * Authorization header). THE system SHALL validate the refresh token
   * signature using the secret key. THE system SHALL verify the refresh token
   * has not expired (comparing exp claim to current time). THE system SHALL
   * verify the refresh token has not been marked as revoked or used.
   *
   * IF refresh token valid and not expired, THE system SHALL generate new JWT
   * access token containing userId, email, role from original token, iat
   * (current time), exp (30 minutes from iat), and tokenType 'access'. THE
   * system SHALL sign the new access token using HS256 algorithm. THE system
   * SHALL optionally generate new refresh token with 7-day expiration if
   * implementing token rotation. THE system SHALL mark the old refresh token
   * as used (preventing reuse for security). THE system SHALL return HTTP 200
   * with new access token and optionally new refresh token.
   *
   * IF refresh token signature invalid, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401
   * Unauthorized with error code 'AUTH_INVALID_TOKEN' and message 'Invalid
   * refresh token. Please log in again.'. IF refresh token expired, THE
   * system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code 'AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_INVALID'
   * and message 'Refresh token expired. Please log in again.'. IF refresh
   * token already used (revoked), THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error
   * code 'AUTH_TOKEN_REVOKED' and message 'Refresh token has already been
   * used. Please log in again.'
   *
   * THE system SHALL NOT accept tokens that have been tampered with or have
   * invalid signatures. THE system SHALL log all token refresh attempts
   * (successful and failed) in todo_app_audit_logs with actor_type
   * 'authenticatedUser', action_type 'TOKEN_REFRESH', entity_type 'SESSION',
   * and operation_status reflecting success or failure.
