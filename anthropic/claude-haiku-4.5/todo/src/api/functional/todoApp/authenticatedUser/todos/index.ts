/**
 * Search, filter, and retrieve paginated list of user's todos with advanced
 * query options.
 *
 * Retrieve a filtered, sorted, and paginated list of todos belonging to the
 * authenticated user. This operation supports complex search queries, multiple
 * filtering criteria, sorting options, and pagination for efficient data
 * retrieval.
 *
 * WHEN an authenticated user submits a search request for todos, THE system
 * SHALL retrieve all todos owned by that user from the todo_app_todos table in
 * the Prisma schema. THE system SHALL apply all specified filters, search
 * criteria, and sorting before returning paginated results. THE system SHALL
 * exclude deleted todos (where deleted_at is not null) from results unless the
 * user explicitly requests to see deleted todos.
 *
 * Search and Filter Capabilities:
 *
 * - WHEN a user provides a search term, THE system SHALL perform full-text search
 *   matching against todo titles and descriptions using fuzzy text matching and
 *   exact substring matching
 * - WHEN a user specifies completion status filter (completed, incomplete, or
 *   all), THE system SHALL filter todos accordingly by the is_completed field
 * - WHEN a user specifies a date range filter, THE system SHALL filter todos by
 *   creation date or modification date within the specified range
 * - WHEN a user specifies sort order (creation_date, modification_date, title,
 *   completion_status), THE system SHALL organize results in the requested
 *   order
 * - WHEN a user specifies sort direction (ascending, descending), THE system
 *   SHALL apply the specified direction
 *
 * Pagination and Performance:
 *
 * - WHEN a user requests paginated results, THE system SHALL return todos in
 *   batches of configurable size (default 20 items per page, maximum 100)
 * - THE system SHALL calculate total count of matching todos for pagination
 *   metadata
 * - THE system SHALL return pagination information including current page, total
 *   pages, total count, page size
 * - FOR large todo collections (100+ items), THE system SHALL load and sort only
 *   the requested page to optimize performance
 * - THE system SHALL complete todo list retrieval within 500 milliseconds for
 *   lists under 500 items, within 1 second for lists up to 1000 items
 *
 * Response Organization:
 *
 * - COMPLETED todos are returned first, followed by INCOMPLETE todos (when not
 *   explicitly sorted differently)
 * - Within each completion status group, todos are sorted by creation date with
 *   newest first (most recent first)
 * - Todos display complete information including ID, title, description,
 *   completion status, creation timestamp, modification timestamp
 *
 * Access Control and Data Security:
 *
 * - WHEN a user requests todos, THE system SHALL return ONLY todos created by
 *   that user using their user ID from the authentication token
 * - THE system SHALL NOT return todos created by other users under any
 *   circumstances
 * - IF a user attempts to access another user's todos through manipulation of
 *   search parameters, THE system SHALL deny access and return authorization
 *   error
 *
 * Error Handling and Edge Cases:
 *
 * - IF no todos match the search criteria, THE system SHALL return empty results
 *   list rather than an error
 * - IF database query fails, THE system SHALL display error and provide retry
 *   options
 * - IF search term contains special characters, THE system SHALL handle properly
 *   without SQL injection vulnerabilities
 * - IF pagination parameters are invalid (negative page, invalid size), THE
 *   system SHALL default to valid parameters and notify user

/**
 * Update an existing todo by ID.
 *
 * This operation allows an authenticated user to update an existing todo item
 * by providing the todo's unique identifier and the properties to modify. Users
 * can update the todo's title (1-255 characters, non-empty) and/or completion
 * status (incomplete or completed). The system validates that the authenticated
 * user owns the todo before allowing any modifications. All updates are
 * persisted immediately to the database and the modification timestamp is
 * automatically updated to reflect the change. The operation returns the
 * complete updated todo with all current properties including the updated
 * modification timestamp.
 *
 * The system verifies user ownership by comparing the authenticated user's ID
 * from their session context to the todo's owner ID stored in the database. If
 * the user does not own the requested todo, the system denies access with HTTP
 * 403 Forbidden error. The system never reveals whether the todo exists or
 * belongs to another user, preventing information disclosure attacks.
 *
 * Validation rules applied to updated title: minimum 1 character, maximum 255
 * characters, cannot be empty or whitespace-only. Validation rules applied to
 * completion status: must be either 'incomplete' or 'completed'
 * (case-sensitive), no other values accepted. If validation fails, the
 * operation is rejected and the todo remains in its previous state with no
 * changes applied.
 *
 * The creation timestamp of the todo remains immutable and unchanged during
 * updates. Only the modification timestamp is updated to the current UTC time
 * whenever any property changes. This preserves the historical record of when
 * the todo was originally created while tracking when it was last modified.
 *
 * Partial updates are supported, allowing users to update only the title
 * without changing completion status, or update only the completion status
 * without changing the title. Other properties (ID, creation timestamp, owner)
 * cannot be modified through this operation and are preserved in their current
 * state.

/**
 * Delete a todo by ID.
 *
 * This operation allows an authenticated user to permanently delete an existing
 * todo item by providing the todo's unique identifier. When a user initiates
 * deletion, the system first displays a confirmation dialog stating 'Are you
 * sure you want to delete this todo? This action cannot be undone.' to prevent
 * accidental deletion. Only after explicit user confirmation does the system
 * proceed with the deletion operation.
 *
 * The system verifies user ownership by comparing the authenticated user's ID
 * from their session context to the todo's owner ID. If the user does not own
 * the requested todo, the system denies the deletion with HTTP 403 Forbidden
 * error, never revealing whether the todo exists or belongs to another user.
 * This prevents unauthorized access and information disclosure.
 *
 * When the user confirms deletion, the system implements soft deletion by
 * setting the todo's 'deleted_at' timestamp to the current UTC time. This marks
 * the todo as deleted while preserving the record in the database for forensic
 * purposes and recovery capability. The deleted todo is immediately removed
 * from the user's normal todo list view but can be recovered through a
 * 'Recently Deleted' section within 30 days of deletion.
 *
 * Within the 30-day recovery period, users can view their deleted todos in the
 * 'Recently Deleted' section and restore any todo by clicking an 'Undo Delete'
 * or 'Restore' button. After 30 days, the todo is permanently purged from the
 * system with no recovery option available. This balance provides data safety
 * for accidental deletions while maintaining eventual complete removal.
 *
 * The deletion operation is atomic and affects only the specified todo. No
 * other todos or related data are affected by the deletion. The operation is
 * logged in the audit trail for compliance documentation with timestamp, user
 * ID, and deletion status recorded for regulatory requirements.
 *
 * The operation returns HTTP 200 OK with success confirmation message 'Todo
 * deleted successfully.' when deletion completes. If the todo does not exist or
 * has already been deleted, the operation returns HTTP 404 Not Found with
 * message 'This todo was not found or has been deleted.' The response does not
 * include the deleted todo's data, only confirmation of successful deletion.
