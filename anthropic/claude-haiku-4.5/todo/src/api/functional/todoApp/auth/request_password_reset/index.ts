/**
 * Request password reset token to be sent to registered email address.
 *
 * This operation initiates the password reset workflow for users who have
 * forgotten their password or need to reset it. The operation handles the first
 * step: validating the user's email address and issuing a time-limited password
 * reset token.
 *
 * WHEN a user submits their email address through this endpoint, THE system
 * SHALL:
 *
 * 1. Validate that an email address has been provided and is in valid format (RFC
 *    5321)
 * 2. Use constant-time operations to search the todo_app_authenticateduser table
 *    for an account matching the provided email
 * 3. Generate a cryptographically secure password reset token (minimum 256-bit
 *    entropy, 32+ characters, Base64 URL-safe encoded)
 * 4. Set token expiration to 1 hour (3600 seconds) from generation time
 * 5. Store the token securely in external key-value store (Redis/Memcached) or
 *    temporary token table (todo_app_password_reset_tokens) with fields:
 *    token_hash, user_id, email_address, token_expires_at
 * 6. Compose a password reset email containing: secure reset link with token,
 *    token expiration time, warning about unsolicited requests, support contact
 *    information
 * 7. Send email to the registered address from no-reply address with clear
 *    branding
 * 8. Apply rate limiting: maximum 3 password reset requests per email address per
 *    15 minutes; return HTTP 429 if exceeded
 *
 * WHEN email is not found OR found, THE system SHALL display identical response
 * message: "If an account exists for this email, you will receive a password
 * reset email shortly. Please check your inbox and spam folder."
 *
 * THE system SHALL use constant-time operations or introduce random delays
 * (50-500ms) to ensure response time is identical whether the email exists in
 * the system or not, preventing timing-based user enumeration attacks where
 * attackers measure response times to enumerate valid email addresses.
 *
 * The password reset email SHALL contain a secure link that directs the user to
 * a password reset page with the token pre-filled. The user then submits their
 * new password through the POST /todoApp/auth/reset-password endpoint to
 * complete the password reset.
 *
 * This operation does not directly reset the password; it only validates and
 * initiates the reset workflow. This prevents:
 *
 * - Unauthorized password resets through enumeration attacks
 * - Account takeover by attackers guessing email addresses
 * - Direct password resets without email confirmation
 * - Timing-based user enumeration
 *
 * The reset token is single-use and expires after 1 hour for security. Multiple
 * reset requests will generate new tokens, invalidating previous tokens. Upon
 * successful password reset through the reset endpoint, the user can log in
 * with their new password and regain access to their todo list.
