/**
 * Create a new todo with a title and optional description.
 *
 * This operation enables authenticated users to create new todos by submitting
 * a POST request with required title and optional description fields. The
 * system performs comprehensive validation on the title field ensuring it is
 * provided, non-empty, contains no whitespace-only content, and falls within
 * the 1-255 character length requirement. Upon successful validation, the
 * system automatically generates a unique UUID identifier for the todo, sets
 * the initial completion status to false (incomplete), records the current UTC
 * timestamp as both creation and modification time, and associates the todo
 * with the authenticated user.
 *
 * The todo is immediately persisted to the database with full ACID compliance
 * ensuring atomicity and consistency. The system implements transaction-based
 * storage ensuring either the complete todo is created with all properties or
 * the operation fails cleanly without partial state. The response returns HTTP
 * 201 (Created) status code along with the complete todo object including all
 * assigned properties.
 *
 * Data validation enforces these business rules: title field is mandatory and
 * cannot be null, empty string, or contain only whitespace characters; title
 * length must be between 1 and 255 characters inclusive; description field is
 * optional with maximum 2000 characters. The system trims leading and trailing
 * whitespace from titles before validation for seamless user experience.
 *
 * Authorization is automatically enforced through the authenticated user
 * context - the created todo is always associated with the user making the
 * request using their unique user ID from the authentication token. Users
 * cannot create todos for other users or without user association. The system
 * maintains strict data ownership ensuring each user can only access and manage
 * todos they created.
 *
 * Error scenarios include validation failures (empty title, excessive length),
 * network interruptions during save, and database errors. For transient
 * failures, the system automatically retries up to 3 times with exponential
 * backoff. User input is preserved in temporary storage for retry capability,
 * preventing data loss during error conditions. Failed operations return
 * appropriate HTTP status codes with user-friendly error messages explaining
 * what went wrong and suggested corrective actions.

/**
 * Retrieve a specific todo by its unique identifier.
 *
 * This operation enables authenticated users to retrieve detailed information
 * about a specific todo they own by providing the todo's unique identifier in
 * the request path. The system receives the todoId parameter, validates it as a
 * valid UUID format, and queries the persistent storage layer to locate the
 * corresponding todo record.
 *
 * Authorization verification occurs before data retrieval, implementing strict
 * ownership checks. The system compares the authenticated user's ID (from
 * authentication token) against the requested todo's owner. If the user does
 * not own the todo, the system returns HTTP 403 (Forbidden) error with message
 * 'You do not have permission to access this todo'. Critically, the system
 * returns the same error response whether the todo does not exist or the user
 * lacks ownership, preventing user enumeration attacks where attackers could
 * determine which todos exist in the system by analyzing error responses.
 *
 * Upon successful authorization verification, the system retrieves the complete
 * todo record including all properties: unique identifier (UUID), title text,
 * optional description, completion status (boolean), creation timestamp in ISO
 * 8601 UTC format, and last modification timestamp. The response returns HTTP
 * 200 (OK) status code with the complete todo object as JSON payload.
 *
 * Data integrity is maintained throughout retrieval - the system returns the
 * exact current state of the todo as stored in the database, reflecting any
 * recent updates from other operations. Timestamps are preserved with
 * millisecond precision for accurate change tracking. The operation is
 * read-only and does not modify any data or state.
 *
 * Error scenarios include invalid UUID format for todoId (returns HTTP 400 Bad
 * Request with validation error), todo not found or unauthorized (returns HTTP
 * 403 Forbidden with generic authorization error), and database retrieval
 * failures (returns HTTP 500 Server Error with recovery guidance). For
 * transient database errors, the system implements automatic retry with
 * exponential backoff, attempting recovery transparently without blocking the
 * user.
