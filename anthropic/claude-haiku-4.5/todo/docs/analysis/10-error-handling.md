# Error Handling Requirements for Todo List Application

## 1. Error Handling Overview

### 1.1 Error Handling Philosophy
The Todo list application must provide comprehensive error handling that prioritizes user experience while maintaining data integrity. Errors must be communicated clearly and in user-friendly language, enabling users to understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue. The system must prevent data loss during error conditions and provide clear recovery paths.

### 1.2 Error Classification System

Errors in the Todo application are categorized into four severity levels:

| Severity Level | Description | User Impact | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | System cannot function; data at risk | Application becomes unusable | Automatic recovery or manual intervention required |
| **High** | Operation failed; user action required | Current task cannot complete | User must take corrective action |
| **Medium** | Operation partially affected; retry possible | User experience degraded | Automatic retry or user-initiated retry |
| **Low** | Minor issue; operation may proceed | Informational only | No action required |

### 1.3 Error Communication Standards

WHEN the system encounters any error condition, THE system SHALL provide:
- A clear, human-readable error message in the user's language
- Specific information about what went wrong
- Suggested corrective actions or recovery steps
- An error code for technical reference (format: TODOAPP-XXXX where X represents error category and sequence)

---

## 2. Authentication and Session Errors

### 2.1 Session Management Without Required Authentication

Since the Todo application is designed as a single-user system without mandatory authentication, THE system SHALL automatically grant access to users without login requirements.

WHEN a user accesses the application for the first time, THE system SHALL immediately display the todo management interface and load any previously saved todos.

WHEN a user returns to the application after closing it, THE system SHALL load all previously created todos without requiring any authentication or login process.

### 2.2 Data Store Access Failure

IF the system cannot locate or access the user's data store, THE system SHALL display error message "TODOAPP-AUTH-001: Unable to load your todo list. Please refresh the page and try again."

THE system SHALL provide a "Refresh" button that allows the user to retry data loading without losing any work in progress.

### 2.3 Cross-Device Session Management

WHEN a user accesses the application from a different device or browser, THE system SHALL treat this as a new session but display all previously saved todos.

THE system SHALL synchronize todos across devices automatically if cloud storage or shared data persistence is implemented.

IF synchronization between devices fails, THE system SHALL display message "TODOAPP-AUTH-002: Unable to sync with your other devices. Changes will sync when connection is restored."

### 2.4 Session Timeout Handling

WHEN a user's session remains inactive for 24 hours, THE system SHALL maintain all data in persistent storage.

WHEN the user returns after 24 hours of inactivity, THE system SHALL load all todos without requiring re-authentication or showing error messages.

---

## 3. Validation Errors

### 3.1 Todo Title Validation Errors

#### Empty Title Error
WHEN a user attempts to create or update a todo without entering a title, THE system SHALL display error "TODOAPP-VAL-001: Todo title cannot be empty. Please enter a title for your todo."

THE system SHALL NOT create or save the todo until a valid title is provided.

THE system SHALL highlight the title input field to clearly indicate where the user needs to make corrections.

#### Whitespace-Only Title
WHEN a user enters only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) as a title, THE system SHALL treat this as an empty title and display the same error as empty title validation.

THE system SHALL trim leading and trailing whitespace from titles before saving to provide seamless user experience.

#### Maximum Length Violation
WHEN a user attempts to enter a todo title exceeding 255 characters, THE system SHALL:
- Display warning message "TODOAPP-VAL-002: Todo title is too long. Maximum 255 characters allowed. Current: [X] characters."
- Prevent the user from entering additional characters
- Show character count indicator in real-time updating as user types

THE system SHALL allow the user to save the todo only after reducing the title to 255 characters or fewer.

#### Minimum Length Validation
IF a user submits a title with fewer than 1 character, THE system SHALL reject it with error "TODOAPP-VAL-003: Todo title must contain at least 1 character."

### 3.2 Description Field Validation

WHEN a user attempts to enter a description exceeding 2000 characters, THE system SHALL display error "TODOAPP-VAL-004: Description is too long. Maximum 2000 characters allowed. Current: [X] characters."

THE system SHALL prevent saving until the description is shortened to 2000 characters or fewer.

THE system SHALL display a character counter for the description field showing current character count and maximum allowed.

### 3.3 Special Characters and Encoding Validation

WHEN a user enters special characters, emoji, or non-ASCII characters in a todo title, THE system SHALL accept and store these characters correctly without validation errors.

IF the system encounters encoding issues with special characters, THE system SHALL display error "TODOAPP-VAL-005: Invalid character encoding. Please try again with standard characters."

THE system SHALL provide guidance about which character types are supported if encoding errors occur.

### 3.4 Duplicate Todo Validation

WHEN a user attempts to create a todo with identical title to an existing incomplete todo, THE system MAY display warning "TODOAPP-VAL-006: A similar todo already exists. Do you want to create a duplicate?" with "Create Duplicate" and "Cancel" buttons.

THE system SHALL allow users to create duplicate todos if they confirm, ensuring users are not prevented from managing similar tasks.

### 3.5 Data Type Validation

WHEN the system receives invalid data types for todo operations (such as text submitted for a boolean completion status), THE system SHALL display error "TODOAPP-VAL-007: Invalid data format. The system received unexpected data type. Please refresh the page and try again."

THE system SHALL NOT process the operation until corrected data is provided.

THE system SHALL automatically retry the operation up to 3 times with 1-second intervals between retry attempts.

AFTER 3 failed retry attempts, THE system SHALL notify the user with message "TODOAPP-OP-001-RETRY: Still unable to save. Your todo has been saved locally and will sync when your connection improves."

THE system SHALL preserve the todo content in a temporary client-side buffer so the user does not lose their work.

#### Storage Quota Exceeded
IF the application's storage quota is exceeded and the user cannot create new todos, THE system SHALL display error "TODOAPP-OP-002: Storage limit reached. You have saved [X] todos. Maximum allowed: [Y]. Please delete some existing todos and try again."

THE system SHALL prevent creation of new todos and provide suggestions for freeing storage space.

THE system SHALL offer to show a list of completed todos that can be safely deleted.

#### Network Error During Creation
WHEN network connectivity is lost during todo creation, THE system SHALL preserve the todo in a local draft state.

THE system SHALL display message "TODOAPP-OP-003: Unable to save todo. Working offline. Your draft has been saved locally and will be created when your connection is restored."

WHEN network connectivity is restored, THE system SHALL automatically send the pending todo creation and display "TODOAPP-OP-003-SYNC: Draft todo created successfully."

### 10.2 Error Alerts for Administrators

WHEN critical errors occur repeatedly (more than 5 occurrences within 1 hour), THE system SHALL:
- Alert system administrators of potential system health issues
- Provide error trending information and patterns
- Indicate which features or operations are most affected
- Recommend prioritization for investigation and fixes
- Enable manual intervention when necessary
- Show error spike analysis and contributing factors

### 10.3 User Reporting of Error Issues

WHEN persistent critical errors occur, THE system SHALL:
- Provide error details for user support contact in shareable format
- Generate error report containing error code, timestamp, and description
- Allow user to attach additional context or description
