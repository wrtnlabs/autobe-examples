## Project Key Characteristics

### Minimal, Focused Scope

The Todo List Application is intentionally designed with minimal functionality to deliver maximum value through simplicity:

- **Core Features Only:** The system provides exactly four operations: create, read, update, delete todos
- **No Advanced Features:** The application deliberately excludes due dates, priorities, categories, tags, recurring tasks, and other features
- **Single Purpose:** The entire system focuses on one objective: helping users manage their daily tasks
- **User-Centered Design:** Every feature decision prioritizes user experience and ease of use over technical sophistication

### Single-User Architecture

The application is optimized for individual users managing their personal todo lists:

- **No Multi-User Complexity:** The system doesn't require complex permission models, user management, or data isolation at scale
- **Simplified Authentication:** While JWT-based authentication is implemented for security, there's no complex multi-tenant architecture
- **Focused Access Control:** Each user can only manage their own todos; no sharing or collaboration features
- **Streamlined Operations:** All system operations optimize for one user at a time

### Data Persistence Guarantee

The application commits to reliable data storage:

- **Permanent Storage:** All todos are saved immediately to persistent storage
- **No Data Loss:** Users can trust that their todos will be preserved across sessions and application restarts
- **Recovery from Errors:** The system implements recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss during error conditions
- **Backup and Reliability:** Data persistence is a core architectural principle, not an afterthought

### Performance and Reliability

The application prioritizes responsive, reliable operation:

- **Fast Responses:** All user actions respond within milliseconds for perceived instant response
- **Quick Load Times:** Todo lists load within seconds regardless of quantity
- **99% Availability:** The system maintains high reliability for user access
- **Graceful Error Handling:** Errors are handled without losing user data or breaking functionality

### Design Philosophy

The Todo List Application follows these core principles:

- **Simplicity:** Every feature is questioned; only essential functionality is included
- **Reliability:** Data preservation and consistency are non-negotiable requirements
- **Usability:** The interface and workflows are optimized for ease of use
- **Performance:** The system is fast and responsive to user actions
- **Clarity:** All requirements are specified clearly for implementation

---

## Documentation Standards and Approach

### Natural Language Business Requirements

All documentation in this suite is written in natural language that describes business requirements from a user and business perspective:

- Documents explain WHAT the system should do and WHY
- Documents avoid prescribing HOW to implement features (that's the development team's expertise)
- Requirements are specific and measurable
- All business processes are described step-by-step

### EARS Format for Clarity

Where applicable, requirements use the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format for clarity:

- **WHEN:** Specifies the condition that triggers the requirement
- **THE:** Specifies the system or component being discussed
- **SHALL:** Specifies the mandatory action or behavior
- **IF/THEN:** Specifies conditional logic

**Example:** "WHEN a user creates a new todo, THE system SHALL validate that the title is not empty and does not exceed 255 characters. IF the title is invalid, THEN the system SHALL display a validation error."

### Technology-Agnostic Specifications

All documentation focuses on business requirements without prescribing technical implementation:

- No database schema definitions
- No API endpoint specifications
- No programming language or framework requirements
- No infrastructure or deployment details
- Development team has full autonomy for technology choices

### Complete and Comprehensive

Each document is self-contained and comprehensive:

- All outline sections are fully developed
- No placeholder text or incomplete sections
- Every requirement is specified completely
- Related information is cross-referenced
- Readers don't need to search other documents for basic information

---

- [Error Handling](./10-error-handling.md) covers failure scenarios
- All technical requirements documents reference [User Roles and Authentication](./02-user-roles-authentication.md) for permission context

### Consistency Across Documents

All documents follow these standards for consistency:

- Terminology is consistent across all documents
- User roles and permissions are referenced uniformly
- Cross-references use descriptive link text
- Examples and scenarios are realistic and relatable
- Business rules stated in one document are referenced in related documents
