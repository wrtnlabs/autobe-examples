# User Roles, Authentication & Authorization Requirements

## 1. Authentication System Overview

### Purpose
The authentication system provides secure user access to the Todo List application while maintaining data privacy and integrity. The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless token-based authentication, allowing users to securely manage their personal todo lists.

### Authentication Architecture
THE authentication system SHALL use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) as the primary mechanism for user authentication and authorization. THE system SHALL validate all incoming requests using JWT tokens to determine user identity and permissions. THE system SHALL maintain user sessions using secure token management practices.

### Design Principles
- **Minimal Complexity**: Single-user focused design with straightforward authentication
- **Token-Based**: Stateless authentication using JWT tokens
- **Security-First**: All user data is protected and access is controlled
- **User Privacy**: Users can only access their own todo data
- **Clear Boundaries**: Guest, authenticated user, and administrator roles have distinct permissions

---

## 2. User Registration and Login

### User Registration Process

WHEN a user submits registration credentials (email and password), THE system SHALL validate that the email is in valid email format and the password meets security requirements. THE system SHALL store the user credentials securely. THE system SHALL create a new user account and respond with success confirmation. THE system SHALL allow the user to proceed to login.

**Registration Requirements:**
- Email address must be valid and unique across the system
- Password must be at least 8 characters long
- Password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number
- User must agree to terms of service (if applicable)
- System shall reject duplicate email addresses with appropriate error message

**Registration Validation Flow:**
1. User enters email address
2. System validates email format using RFC 5322 standard
3. System checks if email already exists in database
4. IF email exists, THEN system returns error "Email already registered"
5. User enters password meeting security requirements
6. System validates password against complexity rules
7. IF password invalid, THEN system returns specific error for missing requirement
8. System creates user account with securely hashed password
9. System returns success confirmation

### User Login Process

WHEN a user submits email and password credentials at login, THE system SHALL validate the credentials against stored user data. IF the credentials are valid, THE system SHALL generate a JWT access token and return it to the user. IF the credentials are invalid, THE system SHALL return an authentication error and deny access. THE system SHALL initialize a user session upon successful login.

**Login Flow:**
1. User submits email and password
2. System validates email exists in database
3. System validates password matches stored credential using secure comparison
4. IF credentials incorrect, THEN system returns error "Invalid email or password" (generic message for security)
5. IF credentials valid, THEN system generates JWT access token with user claims
6. System stores token in user's session
7. System returns token to user with 30-minute expiration
8. User's session begins with authenticated status

**Login Error Responses:**
- Email not found: Return "Invalid email or password"
- Password incorrect: Return "Invalid email or password"
- Account locked: Return "Account temporarily locked. Please try again later or reset password."
- System error: Return "Unable to process login. Please try again."

### User Logout Process

WHEN a user initiates logout, THE system SHALL invalidate the user's current session and revoke the JWT token. THE system SHALL remove session data associated with the user. THE system SHALL return confirmation of logout completion.

WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL:
1. Mark the current JWT token as revoked in session storage
2. Clear all session cookies and local storage tokens
3. Remove user session from server records
4. Redirect to login page
5. Display confirmation message "You have been successfully logged out"

## 3. User Roles and Permission Hierarchy

The Todo List application implements three distinct user roles, each with specific permissions and responsibilities:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["System User"] --> B{"Authenticated?"}
    B -->|"No"| C["Guest User"]
    B -->|"Yes"| D{"Admin Role?"}
    D -->|"Yes"| E["Administrator"]
    D -->|"No"| F["Authenticated User"]
    
    C -.->|"Limited Access"| G["Public Endpoints Only"]
    F -->|"Full Access"| H["Todo Operations"]
    E -->|"System Access"| I["Admin Functions"]
```

### Role Hierarchy Overview
- **Guest User (Level 0)**: No authentication required, minimal access
- **Authenticated User (Level 1)**: Full todo management access, primary user role
- **Administrator (Level 2)**: System-wide access, elevated privileges

---

## 4. Guest User (Unauthenticated)

### Role Definition
Guest users are individuals who access the application without authentication. This role represents the entry point to the system before account creation or login.

### Permitted Operations
- THE system SHALL allow guest users to view public information about the application (landing page, login page, registration page)
- THE system SHALL allow guest users to access user registration endpoints
- THE system SHALL allow guest users to access user login endpoints
- THE system SHALL allow guest users to view password recovery page

### Restricted Operations
Guest users SHALL NOT be able to:
- Create new todos
- View existing todos
- Modify todos
- Delete todos
- Access authenticated user features
- View other users' data
- Access administrative functions
- View system logs or diagnostics

### Use Cases
- New users visiting the application for the first time
- Users accessing the system without credentials
- Users navigating to registration or login pages
- Users accessing password reset functionality

### Authentication Token
Guest users do not receive JWT tokens. They cannot access any endpoints that require authentication. WHEN a guest user attempts to access an authenticated endpoint, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) with error code "AUTH_NOT_AUTHENTICATED" and redirect to login page.

---

## 5. Authenticated User (Member)

### Role Definition
Authenticated users are registered individuals who have successfully logged in to the application. These users represent the primary user persona for the Todo List application.

### Permitted Operations

#### Todo Management
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to create new todos
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to read and view all their todos
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to update their own todos
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to delete their own todos
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to mark todos as complete or incomplete
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to edit todo titles and descriptions

#### Account Management
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to view their own account information
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to change their password
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to manage their session
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to request password reset

### Restricted Operations
Authenticated users SHALL NOT be able to:
- View other users' todos (in multi-user expansion)
- Modify other users' todos
- Delete other users' todos
- Access administrative functions
- Manage other user accounts
- Modify system settings
- Access system logs or diagnostics
- Create or delete user accounts

### Data Isolation
WHEN an authenticated user requests their todo list, THE system SHALL return only todos created by that user. THE system SHALL enforce strict data isolation to prevent users from accessing other users' data. WHEN a user attempts to access a todo by ID that does not belong to them, THE system SHALL return error "UNAUTHORIZED_RESOURCE" with HTTP 403 status.

### JWT Token Requirements for Authenticated Users
THE system SHALL issue JWT tokens to authenticated users containing:
- **userId**: Unique user identifier for resource association
- **email**: User email address for identification
- **role**: User role value set to "authenticatedUser"
- **iat (issued at)**: Token creation timestamp in Unix epoch format
- **exp (expiration)**: Token expiration timestamp (30 minutes from iat)
- **tokenType**: Value "access" to identify token purpose

**Example Token Payload:**
```json
{
  "userId": "user_550e8400_e29b_41d4_a716_446655440000",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "authenticatedUser",
  "iat": 1634567890,
  "exp": 1634569690,
  "tokenType": "access"
}
```

---

## 6. Administrator Role

### Role Definition
Administrators are system operators with elevated privileges for managing system-wide functions and configuration. In a minimal single-user Todo application, the administrator role provides capabilities for system maintenance and monitoring.

### Permitted Operations

#### System Management
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to access system monitoring endpoints
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to view system status and health information
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to access application logs for troubleshooting
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to view system configuration settings

#### User Management (if applicable)
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to view registered user accounts
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to manage user account status if necessary
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to reset user passwords in case of emergency
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to view user activity logs

#### Administrative Access
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to perform all operations available to authenticated users (full todo CRUD access)
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to access administrative configuration endpoints
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to access audit logs and security events

### JWT Token Requirements for Administrator
THE system SHALL issue JWT tokens to administrators containing:
- **userId**: Unique administrator identifier
- **email**: Administrator email address
- **role**: User role value set to "administrator"
- **isAdmin**: Boolean flag set to true indicating administrative privileges
- **adminLevel**: Integer value (1-5) indicating scope of administrative access
- **iat (issued at)**: Token creation timestamp in Unix epoch format
- **exp (expiration)**: Token expiration timestamp (24 hours from iat for extended admin session)
- **tokenType**: Value "access" to identify token purpose

**Example Administrator Token Payload:**
```json
{
  "userId": "admin_550e8400_e29b_41d4_a716_446655440000",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "role": "administrator",
  "isAdmin": true,
  "adminLevel": 5,
  "iat": 1634567890,
  "exp": 1634654290,
  "tokenType": "access"
}
```

### Note on Admin Role
For this minimal Todo application, the administrator role is provided as a system capability for future expansion or system maintenance purposes. In typical operation, users will authenticate as authenticated users to manage their todos.

---

## 7. JWT Token Management

### Token Structure and Format

JWT tokens consist of three parts encoded in Base64: Header, Payload, and Signature, separated by dots (.).

**Header Component:**
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

**Payload Component (Authenticated User Example):**
```json
{
  "userId": "user_550e8400_e29b_41d4_a716_446655440000",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "authenticatedUser",
  "iat": 1634567890,
  "exp": 1634569690,
  "tokenType": "access"
}
```

**Signature Component:**
The signature is created by encoding the header and payload with a secret key using HS256 algorithm.

**Complete Token Example:**
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJ1c2VyXzU1MGU4NDAwX2UyOWJfNDFkNF9hNzE2XzQ0NjY1NTQ0MDAwMCIsImVtYWlsIjoidXNlckBleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsInJvbGUiOiJhdXRoZW50aWNhdGVkVXNlciIsImlhdCI6MTYzNDU2Nzg5MCwiZXhwIjoxNjM0NTY5NjkwLCJ0b2tlblR5cGUiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ
```

### Token Claims Specifications

THE JWT token SHALL contain the following required claims:
- **userId**: Unique user identifier as string for tracking user operations and resource association
- **email**: User email address as string for user identification and communication
- **role**: User role as string (guestUser, authenticatedUser, or administrator)
- **iat (issued at)**: Token creation timestamp as Unix epoch seconds (e.g., 1634567890)
- **exp (expiration)**: Token expiration timestamp as Unix epoch seconds calculated as iat + token lifetime
- **tokenType**: String value identifying token purpose ("access" for access tokens, "refresh" for refresh tokens)

### Access Token Specifications

**Lifetime and Expiration:**
THE access token SHALL expire 30 minutes (1800 seconds) after issuance. WHEN a token exceeds its expiration time, THE system SHALL reject the token and return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) with error code "AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED".

**Generation Rules:**
THE system SHALL generate a new access token upon successful user login. THE system SHALL generate a new access token whenever a refresh token is used to obtain fresh credentials. THE system SHALL use a cryptographically secure random generator for token generation.

**Validation Rules:**
THE system SHALL validate the access token signature using the secret key before processing any authenticated request. THE system SHALL reject any token with invalid signature with HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) and error code "AUTH_INVALID_SIGNATURE".

**Signing Algorithm:**
THE system SHALL use HS256 (HMAC SHA-256) as the signing algorithm for JWT tokens. THE system SHALL store the signing secret key securely in environment variables or secure vault, never in source code.

### Refresh Token Specifications

**Purpose:**
THE refresh token allows users to obtain new access tokens without re-entering credentials, improving user experience while maintaining security.

**Lifetime:**
THE refresh token SHALL expire 7 days (604,800 seconds) after issuance. Refresh tokens have significantly longer lifetime than access tokens to reduce login friction.

**Generation:**
THE system SHALL generate a refresh token alongside the access token upon successful login. THE system SHALL use a different secret key for refresh token signing than access tokens.

**Validation:**
WHEN a user submits a refresh token to obtain a new access token, THE system SHALL validate the refresh token's signature and expiration. IF the refresh token is valid and not expired, THE system SHALL generate and return a new access token. IF the refresh token is expired or invalid, THE system SHALL return error "AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_INVALID" with HTTP 401 status, requiring user to log in again.

### Token Storage Recommendations

THE client application SHALL store JWT tokens securely using one of the following methods:
- **Secure httpOnly Cookie (Recommended)**: Recommended for enhanced security as prevents JavaScript access to tokens, mitigating XSS attacks
- **LocalStorage**: Alternative option with lower security, accessible to JavaScript code
- **SessionStorage**: Alternative option for session-only token storage, cleared when browser closes

THE client application SHALL automatically include the JWT token in the Authorization header of all authenticated requests using the format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Storage Security Requirements:**
THE token storage mechanism SHALL prevent unauthorized access. Tokens SHALL NOT be stored in plain HTML attributes or log files. Tokens SHALL NOT be displayed in browser console or error messages.

### Token Validation Rules

WHEN the system receives an authenticated request, THE system SHALL validate the JWT token by:
1. Verifying that token has proper format (three Base64-encoded parts separated by dots)
2. Decoding header and verifying algorithm matches expected value (HS256)
3. Decoding payload and extracting claims
4. Verifying the token signature using the secret key
5. Checking that the token has not expired (comparing exp claim to current time)
6. Verifying that the token has valid structure
7. Confirming the token algorithm matches expected value (HS256)
8. Extracting user claims from the token payload

IF any validation check fails, THE system SHALL reject the request and return an appropriate HTTP error code:
- Invalid signature: HTTP 401 with error code "AUTH_INVALID_TOKEN"
- Expired token: HTTP 401 with error code "AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED"
- Malformed token: HTTP 401 with error code "AUTH_MALFORMED_TOKEN"

### Token Revocation

WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL invalidate their JWT token by:
- Removing the token from the client application storage
- Marking the token as revoked in system records (optional token blacklist)
- Preventing reuse of the revoked token
- Logging the token revocation event

THE system SHALL reject any requests using revoked tokens with HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) and error code "AUTH_TOKEN_REVOKED".

---

## 8. Session Management

### Session Lifecycle

**Session Creation:**
WHEN a user successfully logs in with valid credentials, THE system SHALL create a new session associated with that user. THE system SHALL generate a JWT token representing the authenticated session. THE system SHALL initialize session state with user identification, authentication timestamp, and session identifier.

**Session Activation:**
THE session becomes active immediately upon token generation. THE user gains access to all resources and operations permitted by their role. THE session remains active for the duration specified by the JWT token expiration time.

**Session Duration:**
THE access token associated with a session SHALL expire 30 minutes after creation. THE system SHALL automatically terminate the session when the access token expires. THE system SHALL log the user out automatically when the session expires.

**Session Termination:**
WHEN a user explicitly logs out, THE system SHALL terminate the session immediately. THE system SHALL invalidate the JWT token associated with the session. THE system SHALL remove all session state associated with the user. THE system SHALL clear cookies and local storage tokens on the client side.

### Session Expiration Policy

**Idle Timeout:**
THE system SHALL expire user sessions 30 minutes after the last authenticated request. THE system SHALL terminate the session and require re-authentication. THE system SHALL notify the user that their session expired due to inactivity.

**Absolute Timeout:**
THE system SHALL expire all sessions 24 hours after creation, regardless of user activity. THE system SHALL require users to log in again after this period. This prevents indefinite token validity even if refresh tokens are used continuously.

**Warning Before Expiration:**
THE system MAY display a warning to users 5 minutes before their session expires to allow them to save work or request session extension. THE warning message SHALL be "Your session expires in 5 minutes. Click here to extend your session."

### Concurrent Session Handling

WHEN a user logs in from multiple devices or browsers, THE system SHALL allow multiple concurrent sessions from the same user. EACH session SHALL have independent JWT tokens. Logout action on one device SHALL only terminate that specific session, not all sessions for the user.

**Session Tracking:**
THE system SHALL maintain a list of active sessions per user including:
- Session ID
- Device/browser identifier
- Login timestamp
- Last activity timestamp
- IP address (for security monitoring)

WHEN a user logs out from one session, THE system SHALL remove only that session from the active sessions list. Other active sessions for the same user remain valid and usable.

### Session Security

- THE system SHALL transmit session tokens only over HTTPS encrypted connections
- THE system SHALL store session tokens securely on the client side using httpOnly cookies
- THE system SHALL validate session tokens on every authenticated request
- THE system SHALL never store plaintext passwords in session data
- THE system SHALL include session identifiers in JWT token payload for audit trail purposes
- THE system SHALL implement session token encryption at rest if stored on server
- THE system SHALL use secure session ID generation algorithm

**Legend:** ✅ = Permitted | ❌ = Not Permitted

### Permission Enforcement Rules

WHEN a user attempts any operation, THE system SHALL:
1. Verify user authentication status using valid JWT token
2. Extract user role from token claims
3. Check permission matrix for the requested operation
4. Grant or deny access based on matrix result
5. Log the access attempt for audit purposes

IF permission check fails, THE system SHALL return HTTP 403 (Forbidden) with error code "PERMISSION_DENIED".

---

## 10. Authentication Error Handling

### Invalid Credentials

WHEN a user submits incorrect email or password at login, THE system SHALL verify that neither the email nor the provided password match stored credentials. THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code with error code `AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS`. THE system SHALL display user-friendly error message: "Email or password is incorrect. Please try again." THE system SHALL not reveal whether the email exists or the password was wrong to protect user privacy.

**Rate Limiting:**
WHEN a user fails login 3 times within 5 minutes, THE system SHALL temporarily lock the account. THE system SHALL return error code "AUTH_ACCOUNT_LOCKED" with message "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts. Please wait 15 minutes and try again."

### Missing Credentials

IF a user submits login request without providing email or password, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code with error code `AUTH_MISSING_CREDENTIALS`. THE system SHALL display error message: "Email and password are required."

### Expired Token

WHEN a user makes a request with an expired JWT token, THE system SHALL detect the expiration by comparing the exp claim to the current timestamp. THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code with error code `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED`. THE system SHALL display message: "Your session has expired. Please log in again." THE system SHALL redirect the user to the login page.

**Token Expiration Detection:**
THE system SHALL use the following logic for expiration checking:
```
IF current_time >= token.exp THEN token is expired
```

### Invalid Token

IF a user provides a malformed, tampered, or invalid JWT token, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code with error code `AUTH_INVALID_TOKEN`. THE system SHALL display message: "Authentication token is invalid. Please log in again."

**Invalid Token Scenarios:**
- Signature verification fails: Error code "AUTH_INVALID_SIGNATURE"
- Token format incorrect (not three parts): Error code "AUTH_MALFORMED_TOKEN"
- Token claims missing required fields: Error code "AUTH_INVALID_CLAIMS"
- Token algorithm differs from expected: Error code "AUTH_INVALID_ALGORITHM"

### Missing Token

WHEN a user makes a request to an authenticated endpoint without providing a JWT token, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code with error code `AUTH_MISSING_TOKEN`. THE system SHALL display message: "Authentication token is required. Please log in."

### Duplicate Email Registration

WHEN a user attempts to register with an email address already associated with an existing account, THE system SHALL return HTTP 409 (Conflict) status code with error code `AUTH_EMAIL_EXISTS`. THE system SHALL display message: "This email address is already registered. Please log in or use a different email."

**Duplicate Check Process:**
THE system SHALL perform case-insensitive email matching to prevent duplicate email registration with different cases.

### Weak Password

WHEN a user submits a password that does not meet security requirements during registration, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code with error code `AUTH_WEAK_PASSWORD`. THE system SHALL display specific message indicating missing requirement:
- "Password must be at least 8 characters long."
- "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)."
- "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z)."
- "Password must contain at least one numeric digit (0-9)."

THE system SHALL validate all requirements and report all failures simultaneously.

### Invalid Email Format

WHEN a user submits an invalid email address format, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code with error code `AUTH_INVALID_EMAIL`. THE system SHALL display message: "Please enter a valid email address."

### Account Not Found

IF a user attempts to access their account but no matching account exists, THE system SHALL return HTTP 404 (Not Found) status code with error code `AUTH_ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`. THE system SHALL display message: "User account not found."

### Session Timeout

WHEN a user's session has been inactive for 30 minutes and they attempt to make a request, THE system SHALL detect the expired session. THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code with error code `AUTH_SESSION_TIMEOUT`. THE system SHALL display message: "Your session has expired due to inactivity. Please log in again." THE system SHALL redirect to login page.

### Concurrent Login from Different Location

IF the application implements concurrent session limits, WHEN a user logs in from a new location while an active session exists, THE system MAY return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) with error code `AUTH_CONCURRENT_LOGIN_DETECTED`. THE system MAY display message: "You have logged in from a different location. Previous session has been terminated."

ALTERNATIVELY, THE system MAY allow unlimited concurrent sessions from the same user with independent session management.

### Error Recovery Procedures

**For Token Expiration:**
1. User is automatically logged out
2. User is redirected to login page
3. User can log in again to create new session with fresh token
4. New session begins with reset 30-minute timer

**For Invalid Credentials:**
1. User sees clear error message
2. Login form remains available for retry
3. User can attempt login again with correct credentials
4. User can request password reset if password is forgotten
5. After 3 failed attempts, account is temporarily locked

**For Account Issues:**
1. User receives specific error message describing the problem
2. User can attempt to register if account does not exist
3. User can use password reset feature if password is forgotten
4. User can contact support if issue persists
5. Support can verify identity and resolve access issues

## Summary

The Todo List application implements a straightforward authentication system using JWT tokens with three distinct user roles: Guest, Authenticated User, and Administrator. 

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Guest users** have read-only access to public information and registration/login endpoints
- **Authenticated users** have full control over their personal todos
- **Administrators** have system-wide access capabilities
- **JWT tokens** provide secure, stateless authentication with specific claims and expiration
- **Access tokens expire after 30 minutes** requiring periodic re-authentication
- **Refresh tokens enable extended sessions** with 7-day expiration
- **Clear error handling** guides users through authentication failures
- **Permission matrix** precisely defines role-based access control
- **Session management** handles concurrent user sessions independently

Developers implementing this authentication system should follow all EARS-formatted requirements exactly as specified to ensure security, consistency, and proper user experience throughout the application.
