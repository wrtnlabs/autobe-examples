# Business Rules and Validation Logic

## Business Rules Overview

### Purpose and Scope

This document defines all business rules, validation constraints, and operational logic that govern the Todo List application. These rules ensure data integrity, maintain consistent system behavior, and enforce business constraints across all todo operations. All requirements in this document apply to authenticated users managing their personal todos and must be implemented in the backend system.

### Rule Classification

Business rules are organized into the following categories:

- **Creation Rules**: Constraints on when and how todos can be created
- **Modification Rules**: Rules governing todo updates and changes
- **Deletion Rules**: Policies and procedures for removing todos
- **Validation Rules**: Data quality and format requirements
- **Access Control Rules**: Authorization and permission policies
- **Status Management Rules**: Rules governing todo completion status
- **Constraint Specifications**: Quantitative limits and boundaries
- **Business Logic Workflows**: Step-by-step implementation procedures
- **Edge Case Rules**: Special scenarios and boundary conditions

## Todo Creation Rules

### User Authorization for Creation

WHEN an authenticated user attempts to create a new todo, THE system SHALL allow the operation only if the user is logged in with valid authentication credentials.

THE system SHALL associate every newly created todo with the user who created it using the user's unique identifier from their authentication token.

WHEN a guest or unauthenticated user attempts to create a todo, THE system SHALL deny the operation with an authorization error.

### Title Requirements and Validation

THE todo title field SHALL be required for every todo creation. WHEN a user submits a todo creation request, THE system SHALL verify that a title is provided before proceeding.

THE todo title SHALL contain between 1 and 255 characters (inclusive). WHEN a user submits a title shorter than 1 character or longer than 255 characters, THE system SHALL reject the creation with a validation error.

THE todo title SHALL not be empty or contain only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines). WHEN a user submits a title consisting entirely of whitespace, THE system SHALL treat it as an empty title and reject it.

THE system SHALL preserve the exact title text including capitalization and special characters exactly as entered by the user. THE system SHALL NOT modify, truncate, or normalize titles.

WHEN a user submits a title containing special characters, emoji, or international characters, THE system SHALL accept and store these characters correctly.

### Initial Status Assignment

WHEN a new todo is created, THE system SHALL automatically assign the completion status "incomplete" (not completed) to the todo.

THE system SHALL NOT allow users to manually set a different initial status during creation. IF a user attempts to set a completion status other than "incomplete" during creation, THE system SHALL ignore the provided status and set it to "incomplete".

### Timestamp Management

WHEN a todo is created, THE system SHALL automatically assign the current date and time as the creation timestamp in UTC timezone.

THE system SHALL NOT allow users to manually specify or override the creation timestamp.

THE creation timestamp SHALL be immutable throughout the todo's lifecycle and SHALL never be modified after initial creation.

THE system SHALL also initialize the modification timestamp to the same value as the creation timestamp at the moment of creation. WHEN the todo is later updated, THE modification timestamp SHALL be changed, but THE creation timestamp SHALL remain unchanged.

### Duplicate Content Handling

THE system SHALL allow users to create multiple todos with identical titles and descriptions.

THE system SHALL NOT enforce uniqueness constraints on todo content. Duplicate todos are permitted and expected in normal operation.

Each duplicate todo SHALL receive a unique internal identifier (todo ID) even if the title and description are identical to another todo.

---

## Todo Modification Rules

### User Authorization for Updates

WHEN an authenticated user attempts to update a todo, THE system SHALL verify that the user owns the todo (the todo was created by that user).

IF a user attempts to update a todo they do not own, THE system SHALL deny the operation with an authorization error without revealing information about the todo's existence or ownership.

THE system SHALL NOT allow any user to modify todos belonging to other users under any circumstances.

### Title Modification Rules

WHEN a user updates a todo's title, THE new title SHALL meet the same requirements as title creation:
- Minimum length: 1 character (non-whitespace)
- Maximum length: 255 characters
- Cannot consist entirely of whitespace

THE system SHALL preserve the exact title text as entered by the user.

WHEN a user updates only the title without changing other properties, THE system SHALL preserve all other properties (completion status, timestamps) in their current state.

### Completion Status Modification Rules

WHEN a user updates a todo's completion status, THE system SHALL accept only two valid status values: "incomplete" or "completed".

IF a user attempts to set a status value other than "incomplete" or "completed", THE system SHALL reject the update with a validation error.

THE system SHALL allow users to toggle between "incomplete" and "completed" status without restrictions or limitations.

WHEN a user updates only the completion status without changing the title, THE system SHALL preserve the existing title unchanged.

### Update Timestamp Tracking

WHEN any todo property is modified (title, description, or completion status), THE system SHALL automatically update the modification timestamp to the current date and time in UTC timezone.

THE system SHALL NOT allow users to manually specify or override the modification timestamp.

THE creation timestamp SHALL always remain equal to or less than the modification timestamp. THE system SHALL never set modification timestamp to an earlier time than the creation timestamp.

### Partial Update Support

THE system SHALL support partial updates where a user can update either the title or the completion status independently without requiring other properties to be resubmitted.

WHEN a user submits an update containing only the completion status, THE system SHALL process the update and preserve the existing title.

WHEN a user submits an update containing only the title, THE system SHALL process the update and preserve the existing completion status.

### Update Rejection Conditions

IF a user attempts to update a todo that does not exist or has been deleted, THE system SHALL reject the operation with a "not found" error.

IF a user attempts to update a todo to an identical state (same title, same status), THE system MAY process this as a successful no-op update or return a notification that no changes were made.

---

## Todo Deletion Rules

### User Authorization for Deletion

WHEN an authenticated user attempts to delete a todo, THE system SHALL verify that the user owns the todo.

IF a user attempts to delete a todo they do not own, THE system SHALL deny the operation with an authorization error.

THE system SHALL NOT allow any user to delete todos belonging to other users.

### Permanent Deletion

WHEN a user deletes a todo, THE system SHALL permanently remove the todo from the database.

THE system SHALL NOT implement soft delete, archival, or any form of logical deletion for todos. Deleted todos are completely removed.

THE system SHALL NOT provide an undo mechanism or recovery feature for deleted todos within the application. Once deleted, todos cannot be recovered through normal user operations.

### Cascading Operations

THE system SHALL NOT maintain any references to deleted todos in other parts of the system.

WHEN a todo is deleted, THE system SHALL not affect any other data, other todos, or any other system state.

The deletion of a single todo SHALL be an isolated operation that does not trigger deletion or modification of any other todos.

### Deletion Confirmation and Prevention

WHEN a user initiates a todo deletion, THE system SHALL require explicit confirmation before permanent deletion occurs.

The confirmation SHALL clearly state that the action cannot be undone. THE system SHALL prevent accidental mass deletion by requiring individual delete confirmations for each todo.

---

## Data Validation Rules

### Title Field Validation

THE title field SHALL be a text string data type.

THE title length SHALL be between 1 and 255 characters (inclusive). THE system SHALL reject titles shorter than 1 character and titles longer than 255 characters with specific error messages.

THE title SHALL NOT accept null or undefined values. Every todo must have a valid title.

THE title SHALL NOT consist entirely of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns).

THE system SHALL trim leading and trailing whitespace from titles during validation. A title of "  Example  " SHALL be treated as "Example" for storage purposes.

THE system SHALL accept any valid UTF-8 character in titles, including special characters and international characters.

### Completion Status Field Validation

THE completion status field SHALL only accept two predefined values: "incomplete" or "completed".

THE completion status field SHALL NOT accept null, undefined, or any other string values.

THE completion status field SHALL be case-sensitive. Values like "Incomplete", "INCOMPLETE", "true", "false", "0", "1" are invalid.

THE system SHALL validate that status values are exactly one of the two accepted values and reject any deviation.

### User ID Association Validation

EVERY todo in the system SHALL be associated with exactly one user ID.

THE system SHALL NOT create todos without a user ID association.

THE system SHALL NOT allow a todo to be associated with multiple users.

THE user ID association SHALL be immutable and cannot be changed after the todo is created.

### Timestamp Format Validation

ALL timestamp fields (creation and modification) SHALL be stored in ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone.

The format SHALL be: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ (example: 2024-10-16T14:30:45.123Z)

ALL timestamps SHALL include millisecond precision (three decimal places).

THE system SHALL NOT accept timestamp values in other formats or timezones.

WHEN validating timestamps, THE system SHALL verify that the date and time values represent valid dates (February 30th is invalid, hour 25 is invalid).

### Data Type Enforcement

THE title SHALL be stored as a string data type.

THE completion status SHALL be stored as an enumerated value limited to "incomplete" or "completed".

THE user ID SHALL be stored as a unique identifier (UUID, integer, or similar system-specific format).

Timestamps SHALL be stored as datetime objects in UTC timezone, not as strings or Unix timestamps.

---

## Access Control Rules

### User Ownership Model

EVERY todo SHALL belong to exactly one user.

THE user who creates a todo SHALL be considered the owner of that todo. Ownership is established at creation time and is immutable.

WHEN a user views their todo list, THE system SHALL return ONLY todos owned by that user. THE system SHALL not include todos from other users or system todos.

THE system SHALL NOT display, retrieve, or return information about todos belonging to other users to any user.

### Read Access Control

WHEN an authenticated user requests their complete todo list, THE system SHALL return all todos belonging to that user, regardless of completion status.

WHEN an authenticated user requests a specific todo by ID, THE system SHALL verify ownership before returning the todo.

IF a user attempts to read a todo they do not own, THE system SHALL deny access and return an authorization error without confirming the todo's existence.

IF a user attempts to read a todo that does not exist, THE system SHALL return a generic "not found" error (same error as attempting to read a todo they don't own, to prevent user enumeration).

### Create Access Control

WHEN an authenticated user creates a new todo, THE system SHALL automatically associate it with that user as the owner. THE owner relationship is based on the user's unique identifier from their authentication token.

THE system SHALL NOT allow users to create todos and assign ownership to other users.

### Update Access Control

WHEN a user attempts to update a todo, THE system SHALL verify that the user is the owner before processing the update.

ONLY the owner of a todo SHALL be able to modify its properties (title and completion status).

IF a user who does not own a todo attempts to update it, THE system SHALL deny the operation with an authorization error.

### Delete Access Control

WHEN a user attempts to delete a todo, THE system SHALL verify that the user is the owner before processing the deletion.

ONLY the owner of a todo SHALL be able to delete it.

IF a user who does not own a todo attempts to delete it, THE system SHALL deny the operation with an authorization error.

### Guest User Restrictions

WHEN a guest (unauthenticated) user attempts any todo operation (create, read, update, or delete), THE system SHALL deny the operation.

GUEST users SHALL NOT have access to any todo functionality whatsoever. They can only access registration and login endpoints.

---

## Status Management Rules

### Initial Status Assignment

WHEN a todo is created, THE system SHALL automatically set its initial completion status to "incomplete".

THE system SHALL NOT allow creation of todos with any status other than "incomplete".

IF a user provides a completion status during creation, THE system SHALL ignore it and always set the status to "incomplete".

### Allowed Status Transitions

THE system SHALL allow transition from "incomplete" to "completed" status.

THE system SHALL allow transition from "completed" to "incomplete" status.

THE system SHALL allow unlimited transitions between these two states. A todo can be marked complete and incomplete multiple times.

No other status transitions are valid. Only these two states exist in the system.

### Status Lifecycle

A todo may remain in "incomplete" status indefinitely until the user explicitly marks it complete.

A todo may remain in "completed" status indefinitely until the user explicitly marks it incomplete.

THE system SHALL NOT automatically change status based on time, date, age, or any other automatic criteria.

THE system SHALL NOT implement expiration, archival, or automatic status changes based on any factor other than explicit user action.

### Completion Semantics

THE "incomplete" status indicates that the todo task has not been finished by the user.

THE "completed" status indicates that the user has finished or addressed this todo task.

THE system SHALL NOT enforce any specific business logic about what "completed" means beyond its semantic definition. Users define when a task is complete.

### Status and Visibility

WHEN a user views their todo list, both "completed" and "incomplete" todos SHALL be visible and displayed.

THE system SHALL NOT hide, archive, or remove completed todos from view.

THE system MAY provide visual distinction between completed and incomplete todos (different styling, strikethrough text) but SHALL NOT filter them from the list.

---

## Constraint Specifications

### Size Constraints

THE maximum title length SHALL be 255 characters. THE system SHALL reject any title exceeding this limit with an error message indicating the character limit.

THE minimum title length SHALL be 1 character (considering non-whitespace content). THE system SHALL reject empty or whitespace-only titles.

THE system SHALL NOT accept null values for title fields.

### Uniqueness Constraints

THE system SHALL NOT enforce any uniqueness constraints on todo titles or descriptions.

Users SHALL be able to create multiple todos with identical titles and descriptions simultaneously.

THE system SHALL NOT enforce uniqueness on any todo property except the internal todo ID. Todo IDs must be unique; all other properties may be duplicated.

### Cardinality Constraints

EACH user SHALL be able to create an unlimited number of todos (up to system storage limits). There is no maximum todos per user within the application logic.

EACH todo SHALL belong to exactly one user. A todo cannot belong to zero users or multiple users.

EACH user SHALL be associated with zero or more todos. A user with no todos is valid.

### Immutable Field Specifications

THE todo creation timestamp SHALL be immutable. Once set at creation, it cannot be changed under any circumstances.

THE todo ID (unique identifier) SHALL be immutable. It cannot be reassigned, changed, or modified after creation.

THE user ID association SHALL be immutable. A todo cannot be transferred from one user to another after creation.

### Required Field Specifications

THE title field SHALL be required for all todos. Every todo must have a valid, non-empty title.

THE completion status field SHALL be required and SHALL default to "incomplete" for new todos.

THE user ID SHALL be required and SHALL be automatically assigned based on the authenticated user who creates the todo.

Creation and modification timestamps SHALL be required for all todos and shall be automatically managed by the system.

## Complete Business Logic Workflows

### Workflow 1: Todo Creation Business Logic

1. User submits a request to create a new todo with a title
2. System receives the request and verifies user authentication status
3. System validates that a title is provided and not empty/whitespace-only
4. System validates that title length is between 1-255 characters
5. System verifies user has not exceeded any quota limits
6. System generates a unique todo ID (UUID)
7. System associates the todo with the authenticated user's ID
8. System automatically sets completion status to "incomplete"
9. System captures current UTC timestamp as creation time
10. System sets modification timestamp equal to creation timestamp
11. System stores the complete todo record in the database
12. System returns the created todo with all assigned properties
13. System logs the creation event for audit purposes

**Validation Checks:**
- WHEN user submits title, THE system SHALL validate non-empty
- WHEN user submits title, THE system SHALL validate length 1-255 characters
- WHEN creating todo, THE system SHALL verify user authentication

**Failure Scenarios:**
- IF title is empty, THEN reject and return validation error
- IF title exceeds 255 characters, THEN reject and return validation error
- IF user not authenticated, THEN reject and return authorization error
- IF database error occurs, THEN return error and preserve user's input

---

### Workflow 2: Todo List Retrieval Business Logic

1. User submits a request to view their todos
2. System verifies user is authenticated
3. System retrieves the user's ID from authentication context
4. System queries database for all todos belonging to that user ID
5. System sorts todos with incomplete status first, then completed
6. System formats each todo with all properties (ID, title, status, timestamps)
7. System prepares response containing all user's todos (may be empty)
8. System returns the complete list to user
9. System does NOT retrieve or return todos from other users

**Authorization Checks:**
- WHEN user requests todo list, THE system SHALL verify authentication
- WHEN retrieving todos, THE system SHALL filter by user ID only
- THE system SHALL NOT return todos belonging to other users

**Edge Cases:**
- IF user has zero todos, THE system SHALL return empty list, not error
- IF database temporarily unavailable, THEN return error and suggest retry
- IF user authentication context invalid, THEN return authorization error

---

### Workflow 3: Todo Update Business Logic

1. User submits request to update specific todo (identified by todo ID)
2. System verifies user is authenticated
3. System retrieves the todo from database by ID
4. System verifies the authenticated user owns the todo
5. System identifies which properties are being updated (title, status, or both)
6. IF title is being updated:
   - System validates new title (non-empty, 1-255 characters)
   - System trims leading/trailing whitespace
7. IF completion status is being updated:
   - System validates new status is "incomplete" or "completed"
8. System applies all validated updates to the todo
9. System automatically updates modification timestamp to current UTC time
10. System preserves creation timestamp (does not change)
11. System saves updated todo to database
12. System returns updated todo to user with all properties
13. System logs the modification event for audit trail

**Validation Checks:**
- WHEN updating title, THE system SHALL validate 1-255 characters
- WHEN updating status, THE system SHALL validate only "incomplete" or "completed"
- WHEN updating todo, THE system SHALL verify user owns the todo

**Authorization Checks:**
- IF user does not own todo, THEN deny and return authorization error
- IF todo does not exist, THEN return not-found error

---

### Workflow 4: Todo Deletion Business Logic

1. User submits request to delete specific todo (identified by todo ID)
2. System verifies user is authenticated
3. System retrieves the todo from database by ID
4. System verifies the authenticated user owns the todo
5. System displays confirmation dialog with message "Are you sure you want to delete this todo? This action cannot be undone."
6. User confirms deletion
7. System proceeds with permanent deletion
8. System removes the todo record completely from database
9. System confirms deletion was successful
10. System returns deletion confirmation to user
11. System removes todo from any user-visible lists or caches
12. System logs the deletion event for audit trail

**Authorization Checks:**
- WHEN deleting todo, THE system SHALL verify user owns the todo
- IF user does not own todo, THEN deny and return authorization error

**Confirmation Requirements:**
- WHEN user initiates deletion, THE system SHALL show confirmation dialog
- THE confirmation SHALL clearly state action is permanent and irreversible
- WHEN user confirms, THEN proceed with deletion
- WHEN user cancels, THEN abort deletion and return to normal state

**Failure Scenarios:**
- IF todo not found, THEN return not-found error
- IF database error during deletion, THEN return error and preserve todo
- IF user not authenticated, THEN return authorization error

---

## Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

### Whitespace and Text Processing

WHEN a user enters a title with leading whitespace (e.g., "  Learn Programming"), THE system SHALL trim the leading whitespace before storage, resulting in "Learn Programming".

WHEN a user enters a title with trailing whitespace (e.g., "Learn Programming  "), THE system SHALL trim the trailing whitespace before storage, resulting in "Learn Programming".

WHEN a user enters a title with multiple consecutive spaces (e.g., "Learn  Programming"), THE system SHALL preserve all spaces within the text as entered by the user.

WHEN a user enters a title consisting entirely of whitespace (e.g., "     "), THE system SHALL reject it as an invalid empty title.

WHEN a user enters a title with tabs or newlines as the only content, THE system SHALL treat it as whitespace-only and reject it.

### Special Characters and International Text

WHEN a user enters special characters in a todo title (e.g., "Buy milk! @$%^&*()"), THE system SHALL accept and preserve all special characters exactly as entered.

WHEN a user enters emoji characters in a todo title (e.g., "Buy groceries 🛒"), THE system SHALL accept and store emoji correctly.

WHEN a user enters international characters (e.g., "Aprender español", "学習日本語"), THE system SHALL accept and preserve all UTF-8 characters.

WHEN a user enters accented characters (e.g., "Café", "Naïve"), THE system SHALL accept and store them correctly.

### Rapid Consecutive Operations

WHEN a user rapidly creates multiple todos without waiting for confirmation, THE system SHALL accept and process all creation requests sequentially.

THE system SHALL assign unique IDs to each rapidly created todo and store all of them successfully.

THE system SHALL preserve the order of creation based on request arrival time.

WHEN a user rapidly clicks the complete button multiple times on the same todo, THE system SHALL process only the first status change and ignore or acknowledge subsequent redundant requests.

WHEN a user rapidly toggles a todo's completion status (complete, incomplete, complete, incomplete), THE system SHALL apply all transitions in order, resulting in the final state matching the last user action.

### Very Long Titles

WHEN a user attempts to create a todo with a title of exactly 255 characters, THE system SHALL accept it without error.

WHEN a user attempts to create a todo with a title of 256 characters, THE system SHALL reject it with error message indicating the character limit.

THE system SHALL display character count feedback as user types (e.g., "245/255 characters") to prevent exceeding the limit.

### Simultaneous Operations on Same Todo

WHEN two update operations are submitted for the same todo nearly simultaneously, THE system SHALL apply both operations sequentially based on arrival order.

THE system SHALL ensure that the final state reflects the intent of the last operation to arrive at the system.

THE system SHALL use database-level locking or transaction control to prevent race conditions that could create inconsistent states.

### Deleted Todo Access Attempts

WHEN a user attempts to access a previously deleted todo by ID, THE system SHALL return a "not found" error.

THE system SHALL not reveal whether the todo was deleted or never existed (same error response).

WHEN a user attempts to update or delete a todo that no longer exists, THE system SHALL return a "not found" error for both operations.

### Empty Todo List Scenarios

WHEN a user has created no todos, THE system SHALL return an empty todo list when requested.

THE system SHALL display an empty state message ("No todos yet") instead of an error.

THE system SHALL prominently display the "Create New Todo" button to encourage first entry.

### Multiple Browser Tabs/Sessions

WHEN a user opens the same application in multiple browser tabs or windows, THE system SHALL treat these as separate sessions.

WHEN the user creates a todo in one tab, THE system SHALL immediately reflect this todo in the other tabs when the user refreshes or navigates.

WHEN the same todo is updated in different tabs nearly simultaneously, THE system SHALL apply changes sequentially and ensure final state consistency.

### Database Constraint Violations

IF a system error causes a duplicate UUID to be generated (extremely rare), THE system SHALL detect this and regenerate a new UUID to maintain uniqueness.

IF a todo is somehow stored without an associated user ID, THE system SHALL treat this as data corruption and prevent access to the malformed todo.

IF a todo's modification timestamp is somehow set before the creation timestamp (data corruption), THE system SHALL correct this by setting modification time to equal creation time.

## Summary

The Todo list application implements a straightforward but comprehensive set of business rules ensuring data integrity, user ownership, and consistent system behavior. All rules are designed for a single-user focused system where each user can only access and manage their own todos.

**Key Business Rule Principles:**
- **Ownership**: Every todo belongs to exactly one user, and only that user can access or modify it
- **Immutability**: Creation timestamps and user associations never change after creation
- **Simplicity**: Only two status states exist (incomplete/completed) with no complex transitions
- **Validation**: All user input is validated at creation and update time to ensure data quality
- **Permanence**: Deleted todos are gone permanently; no recovery mechanism exists
- **Atomicity**: All operations either completely succeed or completely fail; no partial states
- **Authorization**: Every operation verifies user ownership before allowing access or modification

Developers implementing this system must enforce these business rules consistently across all application layers (validation, business logic, and database layers) to ensure the Todo application maintains data integrity and appropriate security boundaries.
