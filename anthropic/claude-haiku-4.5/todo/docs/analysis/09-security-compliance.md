# Security and Compliance Requirements for Todo List Application

## 1. Security Requirements Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

THE Todo list application SHALL implement comprehensive security measures to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure system integrity. This document defines all security and compliance requirements from a business perspective, specifying WHAT security controls must be implemented without prescribing HOW to implement them.

THESE security requirements apply to:
- User authentication and account management
- Authorization checks for all operations
- Data protection during storage and transmission
- Input validation for all user-provided data
- Session and token management
- Error handling that protects system information
- Administrative access controls
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Compliance with regulatory standards

### 1.2 Security Objectives

THE security framework SHALL achieve these objectives:
- Protect user credentials from unauthorized access and compromise
- Ensure only authenticated users can access their personal todos
- Prevent unauthorized data modification or deletion
- Protect data in transit through encryption
- Protect data at rest through encryption
- Maintain data integrity and consistency
- Provide secure error handling that does not expose system internals
- Support user privacy and data protection rights
- Enable compliance with applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Support incident detection and response

### 1.3 Security Principles

THESE principles guide all security decisions:
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls rather than relying on single mechanism
- **Least Privilege**: Users and processes have minimum required permissions
- **Fail Secure**: Errors result in secure state, not open access
- **User-Centric**: Security enables rather than hinders legitimate user activities
- **Transparency**: Security measures are documented and explained
- **Regularity Testing**: Security controls are tested and validated regularly

## 2. Authentication System

### 2.1 Authentication Overview

WHEN a user accesses the Todo application, THE system SHALL verify the user's identity through secure authentication before granting access to protected resources.

THE system SHALL use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) as the primary authentication mechanism for session management and API access.

### 2.2 User Registration Process

WHEN a user initiates account registration, THE system SHALL follow this complete workflow:

1. **Registration Initiation**
   - User navigates to registration page
   - System displays registration form with email and password fields
   
2. **Input Collection and Initial Validation**
   - User enters email address
   - User enters password
   - User confirms password
   - User clicks "Register" button

3. **Email Validation**
   - WHEN user submits email, THE system SHALL validate email format conforms to RFC 5321 standard
   - IF email format is invalid, THE system SHALL display error "Please enter a valid email address" and remain on registration page
   - IF email format is valid, THE system SHALL check email uniqueness

4. **Email Uniqueness Check**
   - WHEN email format is valid, THE system SHALL query user database to verify email is not already registered
   - IF email already exists, THE system SHALL display error "This email is already registered. Please log in or use a different email address" and remain on registration page
   - IF email is unique, THE system SHALL proceed to password validation

5. **Password Strength Validation**
   - WHEN email is unique, THE system SHALL validate password meets security requirements:
     * Minimum 8 characters in length
     * Includes at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
     * Includes at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
     * Includes at least one numeric digit (0-9)
     * Includes at least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
   - IF password fails validation, THE system SHALL display specific error message explaining requirement not met (e.g., "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter")
   - THE system SHALL remain on registration page allowing user to modify password
   - IF password passes validation, THE system SHALL proceed to account creation

6. **Account Creation**
   - WHEN all validations pass, THE system SHALL create user account with:
     * User email address
     * Hashed and salted password (NOT plaintext)
     * Account creation timestamp
     * User status: "active"
   - THE system SHALL generate unique user ID for account identification

7. **Account Confirmation**
   - THE system SHALL send verification email to registered address
   - Email SHALL contain verification link with time-limited token
   - THE system SHALL set token expiration to 24 hours
   - User MUST verify email within 24 hours to fully activate account

8. **Registration Success**
   - WHEN account created successfully, THE system SHALL display success message "Registration successful. Verification email sent to [email]. Please verify your email to complete registration."
   - THE system SHALL redirect user to email verification page or login page
   - User can now log in with registered credentials after email verification

### 2.3 User Login Process

WHEN an existing user attempts to log in, THE system SHALL follow this complete workflow:

1. **Login Page Access**
   - User navigates to login page
   - System displays form with email and password fields

2. **Credential Submission**
   - User enters registered email address
   - User enters account password
   - User clicks "Log In" button
   - System receives login request

3. **Email Existence Verification**
   - WHEN login request received, THE system SHALL search database for user account with matching email
   - IF no account exists with provided email, THE system SHALL proceed to password validation failure (see step 5)
   - IF account exists, THE system SHALL proceed to password verification

4. **Password Verification**
   - WHEN user account found, THE system SHALL retrieve stored password hash for user
   - WHEN submitted password provided, THE system SHALL hash the submitted password using same algorithm and salt as stored hash
   - THE system SHALL compare computed hash to stored hash
   - IF hashes match, proceed to token generation (step 6)
   - IF hashes do not match, proceed to authentication failure (step 5)

5. **Authentication Failure Handling**
   - IF email not found OR password incorrect, THE system SHALL:
     * Display generic error message: "Invalid email or password. Please try again."
     * NOT indicate whether email exists or password is wrong (prevents user enumeration attacks)
     * Track failed login attempt in security logs
     * Count failed attempts for account
   - WHEN failed login attempts reach 5 within 15 minutes, THE system SHALL:
     * Lock the account temporarily
     * Display message: "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes."
     * Send notification email to account holder: "Multiple failed login attempts detected on your account"
     * Remain on login page allowing user to try again after lockout period

6. **JWT Token Generation**
   - WHEN password verification succeeds, THE system SHALL generate JWT token containing:
     * **User ID**: Unique identifier for authenticated user
     * **Email**: User's email address
     * **Role**: User role (authenticatedUser or administrator)
     * **Issued At (iat)**: Timestamp when token was created (Unix time)
     * **Expiration (exp)**: Timestamp when token expires (Unix time, 15 minutes from iat)
     * **Token Type**: "Bearer" indicating JWT format
   - THE system SHALL sign token using secure cryptographic algorithm (HMAC-SHA256 or stronger)
   - THE system SHALL encrypt token for transit security

7. **Token Delivery to Client**
   - WHEN token generated, THE system SHALL transmit token to client application
   - PREFERRED: Token transmitted via httpOnly cookie (prevents JavaScript access)
   - ALTERNATIVE: Token transmitted in response body for client-side storage
   - Token SHALL be transmitted ONLY over HTTPS/TLS encrypted connection

8. **Session Establishment**

     * Store token securely in httpOnly cookie or secure client storage
     * Establish user session with 30-minute idle timeout
     * Set session creation timestamp
   - THE system SHALL track active session in server (optional, for monitoring)

9. **Login Success**
   - WHEN session established, THE system SHALL:
     * Display success message "Login successful. Redirecting to your todos..."
     * Redirect user to todo dashboard
     * Initialize todo list retrieval
     * Display user's todos

10. **Session Initialization**
    - WHEN user redirected to dashboard, THE system SHALL:
      * Include JWT token in all subsequent requests (Authorization header: "Bearer [token]")
      * Retrieve user's todos using authenticated user ID
      * Display personalized todo list
      * Maintain token for 30 minutes of activity

### 2.4 JWT Token Specifications

WHEN creating JWT tokens, THE system SHALL adhere to these specifications:

**Token Structure**: Header.Payload.Signature format

**Header**:
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

**Payload for Authenticated User**:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_550e8400",

   - Return 429 Too Many Requests when limit exceeded

3. **Rate Limit Headers**
   - THE system SHALL include rate limit info in response headers:
     * X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests
     * X-RateLimit-Remaining: Remaining requests
     * X-RateLimit-Reset: When limit resets

- Prevent reuse of invalidated token

### 7.4 Token Refresh Mechanism (Optional Enhancement)

IF implemented, refresh tokens SHALL:
- Have longer expiration (7 days) than access tokens (15 minutes)
- Allow obtaining new access token without re-login
- Be usable only once (one-time use)
- Be invalidated on logout
- Support token rotation for additional security

**Refresh Token Flow**:
1. User logs in, receives access token (15 min) + refresh token (7 days)
2. User makes requests with access token
3. When access token nearing expiration (< 5 min), client requests new access token
4. Client sends refresh token to server
5. Server validates refresh token (valid, not expired, not reused)
6. Server issues new access token + new refresh token
7. Old refresh token marked as used, cannot be reused

### 7.5 Multi-Device Session Handling

THE system SHALL support user accessing from multiple devices:
- Each device/browser gets independent JWT token
- Tokens expire independently on each device
- Logout on one device does NOT logout other devices
- Each session is completely independent

### 8.4 Data Retention

**Todo Data Retention**:
- WHEN user creates todo, system retains indefinitely until user deletes
- WHEN user deletes todo, system removes permanently within 24 hours
- System does NOT maintain indefinite archive of deleted todos

**Account Data Retention**:
- WHEN user account active, system retains email and password hash
- WHEN user requests account deletion, system deletes all data within 30 days
- After 30 days, no user data remains in system

**Log Data Retention**:
- Security/audit logs retained minimum 90 days
- After 90 days, logs may be deleted or archived
- Sensitive information (emails, IPs) removed from logs before archival

### 8.5 User Data Access Rights

THE system SHALL enable user to:
- Access their account information (email address)
- Download their todo data in standard format (if requested)
- Update their email address
- Change their password
- Delete their account and all associated data
