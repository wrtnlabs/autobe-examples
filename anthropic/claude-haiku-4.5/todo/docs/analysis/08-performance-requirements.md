# Performance Requirements for Todo List Application

## Performance Requirements Overview

This document defines the performance expectations and non-functional requirements for the Todo list application from a user experience perspective. Since this is a minimal todo list application designed for individual users, performance requirements focus on responsive, immediate interactions and reliable data persistence rather than handling massive scale or concurrent users.

The application shall deliver a fast, responsive experience where users perceive all interactions as instantaneous or near-instantaneous, ensuring that the application never feels sluggish or unresponsive.

---

## Response Time Expectations

### User Interface Responsiveness

THE application SHALL respond to all user interactions (button clicks, form submissions, navigation) within 500 milliseconds to provide a responsive, immediate user experience. Users should perceive the application as instantly responsive to their actions without noticeable delays.

WHEN a user performs any action on the todo list (creating, updating, deleting, or marking a todo), THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 200 milliseconds, allowing users to see that their action was registered and is being processed.

THE system SHALL display confirmation messages or updated todo list views within 1 second after a user submits an action, ensuring users have clear visibility into whether their operation succeeded.

### Create Todo Response Time

WHEN an authenticated user creates a new todo by submitting a form with a valid title, THE system SHALL complete the entire create operation (validation, database storage, and list update) within 1 second. THE todo SHALL appear in the displayed list within this timeframe.

### Update Todo Response Time

WHEN an authenticated user updates an existing todo (changing title or status), THE system SHALL complete the entire update operation (validation, database save, and UI refresh) within 1 second. Changes SHALL be immediately visible in the todo list.

### Delete Todo Response Time

WHEN an authenticated user deletes a todo (including any confirmation dialogs and database removal), THE system SHALL complete the entire delete operation within 1 second. THE todo SHALL be removed from the displayed list within this timeframe.

### Toggle Completion Status Response Time

WHEN a user clicks to mark a todo as complete or incomplete, THE system SHALL respond with visual feedback within 200 milliseconds. THE completion status change SHALL be reflected in the UI immediately and persisted to the database within 1 second.

### Login and Access Time

WHEN a user accesses the application, THE system SHALL load and display the initial todo list interface within 2 seconds, allowing quick access to their todos.

THE application SHALL present a fully functional todo list interface (with all todos loaded and ready for interaction) within 3 seconds from initial application launch, supporting quick daily access to the todo list.

---

## Data Load Performance

### Todo List Retrieval

WHEN a user requests to view their complete todo list, THE system SHALL retrieve and display all todos within 500 milliseconds when the user has 100 or fewer todos. THE system SHALL display all todos within 1 second when the user has between 100 and 500 todos. THE system SHALL display all todos within 2 seconds when the user has between 500 and 1,000 todos.

THE system SHALL display a paginated or complete list of todos such that the initial display loads within 1 second, even if the user has accumulated a moderate number of todos (100-500 items).

THE system SHALL organize and sort all retrieved todos before displaying them, with sorting completed within the total display time budget (0.5 to 2 seconds depending on volume).

### Search and Filter Response Time

WHEN a user filters or searches their todo list, THE system SHALL return matching results within 300 milliseconds for lists with fewer than 500 todos. WHEN a user searches a list with more than 500 todos, THE system SHALL return results within 500 milliseconds.

THE application SHALL support instantaneous toggling between view modes (e.g., "All Todos," "Completed Todos," "Incomplete Todos") with view switches completing within 200 milliseconds.

### Data Refresh Performance

WHEN a user refreshes the todo list or navigates back to the main view, THE system SHALL reload all data within 1 second, ensuring users always see current information. THE refresh operation SHALL not cause the application to freeze or become unresponsive.

### Pagination and Lazy Loading

IF the application implements pagination or lazy loading for large todo lists, WHEN a user navigates to the next page or requests additional todos, THE system SHALL load and display the next batch of todos within 500 milliseconds.

---

## Concurrent User Handling

### Single-User Focus

THE Todo application is designed as a single-user system optimized for one user accessing their todo list at a time. THERE is no requirement to handle multiple simultaneous users or concurrent requests from different user accounts.

WHILE THE application operates normally, THE system SHALL maintain all response time expectations with stable performance, sustaining response times within specified limits throughout continuous usage.

### Multi-Device/Multi-Tab Scenario

IF a user accesses the application from multiple browser tabs on the same device or from different devices, THE system SHALL manage data consistency gracefully. WHEN changes are made on one tab/device, THE system SHALL reflect those changes on all other active sessions within 2 seconds.

THE system SHALL prevent data conflicts when the same todo is modified on multiple devices simultaneously. THE most recent change SHALL be applied (last-write-wins) or changes SHALL be merged intelligently to prevent data loss.

### Session Isolation

EACH user session (whether on same device or different device) SHALL maintain independent state. WHEN one session creates a todo, THE system SHALL synchronize it to other sessions automatically. WHEN one session deletes a todo, THE system SHALL remove it from all other sessions.

---

## Data Scalability

### Personal Todo Storage Capacity

THE application SHALL support storing and managing a minimum of 1,000 todos per user without performance degradation. As a single-user application, this represents a reasonable lifetime accumulation of tasks.

WHEN a user has accumulated 500-1,000 todos, THE system SHALL maintain all response time expectations (todos loading within 500ms-2 seconds depending on volume, searches completing within 500ms) with consistent performance across the application lifecycle.

THE system SHALL maintain responsive performance for common operations (creating, updating, deleting todos) even as the todo list grows to 1,000 items, ensuring the user experience remains smooth and predictable.

### Performance Degradation Limits

WHEN a user's todo list exceeds 1,000 items, THE system SHALL inform the user that performance may degrade. IF a user attempts to store significantly more todos (e.g., 10,000+ items), THE system SHALL either:
- Implement enhanced data management (archiving, pagination, or filtering mechanisms)
- Display clear messaging about performance limitations
- Recommend management of older completed todos

THE system SHALL never crash or become completely unusable due to large data volumes. Graceful degradation SHALL ensure partial functionality even under extreme loads.

### Database Growth

THE application's data persistence layer SHALL scale gracefully from 0 todos to 1,000+ todos without requiring schema changes, code modifications, or system restart.

WHEN the application processes the first todo creation, performance SHALL be equivalent to processing the 500th or 1,000th todo. THE system SHALL not demonstrate linear performance degradation as data volume increases.

---

## System Reliability

### Uptime Expectations

THE application SHALL maintain 99% availability during normal operation, ensuring users can access their todos reliably throughout their usage pattern. This translates to maximum 7.2 hours of unplanned downtime per month or approximately 3.6 days per year.

WHILE THE application operates under normal conditions, THE system SHALL function continuously without unexpected crashes, forced restarts, or unplanned downtime that would cause users to lose access to their todos.

### Data Integrity Reliability

THE system SHALL ensure that 100% of todo data persisted to the database is saved completely and accurately. Zero data loss is required. No user data shall be lost or corrupted during normal operations.

WHEN a user creates, updates, or deletes a todo, THE system SHALL guarantee that the change is permanently saved to persistent storage within 1 second, surviving application restarts and unexpected shutdowns.

THE system SHALL implement database transaction support ensuring all-or-nothing semantics: either a todo operation completes fully or is rolled back completely, never leaving the system in a partially-updated state.

### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

THE system SHALL target a MTBF of at least 730 hours (approximately one month) under typical usage patterns. Critical failures requiring manual intervention should occur no more frequently than monthly.

### Error Recovery Time

IF a database connection fails or becomes temporarily unavailable, THE system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically within 5 seconds, resuming normal operations without requiring user intervention.

WHEN the application encounters an error condition, THE system SHALL handle the error gracefully, displaying a user-friendly error message and allowing the user to retry their operation within 10 seconds. Recovery operations SHALL not exceed 15 seconds total time.

### Data Backup and Recovery

THE system SHALL complete automated backups of all user data at least once per day. Backup operations SHALL not impact user-facing performance—backups SHALL occur during off-peak hours or use non-blocking mechanisms.

IF data corruption or loss occurs, THE system SHALL restore from backup within 24 hours maximum, ensuring users do not permanently lose more than 24 hours of data.

---

## Availability Requirements

### Service Hours

THE application SHALL be available during reasonable hours for the user to access their todo list. Since this is a personal application, there is no requirement for strict 24/7 availability, but the system should minimize unplanned downtime.

WHILE THE user attempts to access the application, THE system SHALL respond to access requests within 2 seconds, confirming that the service is available and ready to display the user's todos.

IF planned maintenance is required, THE system SHALL provide 7 days advance notice to users (if applicable), allowing them to plan around maintenance windows.

### Browser Compatibility and Performance

THE application SHALL function reliably and maintain performance targets on all modern web browsers in their current stable versions:
- Chrome (current and previous version)
- Firefox (current and previous version)
- Safari (current and previous version)
- Edge (current and previous version)

Performance targets specified in this document apply equally to all supported browsers. THE system SHALL NOT have different performance characteristics across browsers.

### Network Condition Performance

THE system is designed for users with typical broadband internet speeds (5 Mbps download minimum). THE performance targets specified in this document assume normal network conditions.

UNDER degraded network conditions (1-2 Mbps), THE system SHALL implement graceful degradation:
- Response times MAY increase to 150% of specified targets
- The application SHALL remain functional (not broken)
- Users SHALL receive clear indication of network congestion

---

## Error Recovery Performance

### Operation Failure Recovery Time

IF a user operation fails (such as a network error during a todo creation), THE system SHALL allow the user to retry the operation without losing any manually entered data within 10 seconds.

WHEN an error occurs during a todo operation, THE system SHALL display a clear error message within 500 milliseconds, explaining what happened and how the user can resolve the issue.

### Automatic Retry Performance

WHEN THE system detects a transient error (network timeout, temporary server unavailability), THE system SHALL:
- Attempt automatic retry within 1 second of initial failure
- Complete retry attempts within 3 seconds total
- Notify user if automatic retry fails after 3 attempts

### Data Consistency Recovery Performance

IF THE application detects a conflict between local changes and persisted data, THE system SHALL resolve the conflict and restore data consistency within 5 seconds, ensuring the user's todo list reflects accurate information.

WHEN a user loses connectivity temporarily and regains connection, THE system SHALL synchronize any pending changes with the server within 3 seconds, ensuring data consistency is maintained and changes are confirmed.

### Offline Mode Recovery

WHEN a user regains internet connectivity after working offline, THE system SHALL:
- Detect connectivity restoration within 2 seconds
- Begin synchronizing queued operations automatically
- Complete synchronization of all queued operations within 10 seconds
- Confirm sync completion to user

## Performance Monitoring and Validation

### Measurable Performance Criteria

All response time requirements defined in this document shall be measurable and testable through automated performance testing. Each requirement includes specific millisecond or second targets to enable clear pass/fail evaluation.

EVERY response time metric specified in this document includes:
- Clear trigger condition (WHEN the user...)
- Specific measurable target (within X milliseconds/seconds)
- Applicable conditions (number of todos, network conditions, etc.)

### Performance Testing Approach

THE development team SHALL implement performance testing before release to verify that all response time expectations are met under normal operating conditions. Performance tests should include:

**Load Testing**:
- Measuring response times for all CRUD operations
- Testing performance with various todo list sizes (10, 100, 500, 1,000 items)
- Testing rapid consecutive operations (creating/deleting multiple todos in quick succession)
- Testing search/filter performance with large datasets

**Stress Testing**:
- Validating system behavior when data approaches 1,000+ todos
- Testing with extreme data volumes to identify breaking points
- Measuring performance degradation curves

**Data Persistence Validation**:
- Validating data persistence reliability
- Testing error recovery scenarios and response times
- Verifying zero data loss under failure conditions
- Testing backup and recovery procedures

**Browser Compatibility Testing**:
- Testing performance on all supported browsers
- Verifying response times consistent across browsers
- Identifying browser-specific performance issues

### Performance Testing Acceptance Criteria

All response time and performance targets specified in this document must be met on 95% of operations. Outliers and exceptions are allowed on maximum 5% of operations due to unpredictable factors (network congestion, garbage collection, etc.).

EACH performance target SHALL be validated through:
- Automated performance tests run before each release
- Manual performance testing across supported browsers
- Real-world usage testing with actual data volumes
- Performance regression testing to prevent slowdown over time

### User Experience Performance Standards

THE application's performance shall be perceived by users as responsive and immediate. Users should not experience noticeable delays when:
- Creating new todos (< 1 second end-to-end)
- Updating existing todos (< 1 second)
- Deleting todos (< 1 second)
- Marking todos as complete/incomplete (< 200ms visual feedback)
- Viewing their todo list (< 500ms to 2 seconds depending on volume)
- Searching or filtering todos (< 300-500ms)

IF users perceive any operation as slow or unresponsive (taking more than 2-3 seconds), the application fails this non-functional requirement and requires optimization.

---

## Performance Constraints and Trade-offs

### Simplicity Over Maximum Scale

The Todo application prioritizes simplicity and responsiveness for individual users over handling massive scale or complex concurrent scenarios. Performance requirements are calibrated for a single-user system with typical usage patterns (creating and managing 100-1,000 todos).

THE application deliberately does NOT target supporting:
- Thousands of concurrent users
- Millions of todos per user
- Real-time multi-user collaboration
- Instant synchronization across multiple users

These constraints allow simpler, faster implementation for the primary use case.

### Data Persistence vs. Speed Trade-off

THE application prioritizes data reliability and persistence over absolute maximum speed. THE system guarantees that user data is permanently saved, which may require brief delays (< 1 second) for database write operations. This trade-off ensures users never lose their important todos.

SPEED is important, but DATA LOSS is unacceptable. THE system SHALL NEVER sacrifice data integrity for performance.

### Browser-based Optimization

As a browser-based application, performance depends on both server-side and client-side optimization. Response times account for:
- Network latency (client to server communication)
- Browser rendering and DOM updates
- Server processing time
- Database query execution

THESE combined factors result in realistic end-to-end response time targets that reflect actual user experience.

### Local Caching Trade-off

THE system MAY use local client-side caching to improve perceived performance. However, caching introduces complexity in cache invalidation and data consistency. THE system SHALL prioritize correctness over caching performance gains.
