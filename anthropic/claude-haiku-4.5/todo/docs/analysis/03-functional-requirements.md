# Functional Requirements - Todo List Application

## Functional Requirements Overview

The Todo List Application provides a simple, focused system for users to manage their personal todo items. This document defines all functional requirements from a business perspective, specifying what the system must accomplish without prescribing technical implementation details.

The application supports three user roles with different levels of access:
- **Guest Users**: Can only access authentication endpoints; cannot access todo operations
- **Authenticated Users**: Can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own todos
- **Administrators**: Have elevated system access for administrative functions

This document focuses primarily on the functional requirements for authenticated users, as they represent the core business functionality of the todo management system.

---

## User Authentication Context

### Role-Based Access to Todo Operations

WHEN a guest user attempts to access todo operations (create, read, update, or delete), THE system SHALL deny access and redirect to authentication endpoints.

WHEN an authenticated user logs in successfully, THE system SHALL grant them full access to their personal todo operations and data.

WHEN an administrator accesses the system, THE system SHALL provide administrative capabilities including full system access and monitoring functions.

### User Capability Summary

| User Role | Create | Read Own | Read All | Update Own | Update All | Delete Own | Delete All |
|-----------|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Guest | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Authenticated User | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Administrator | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

---

## Todo Creation Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic Todo Creation

WHEN an authenticated user submits a request to create a new todo, THE system SHALL accept the todo with the following minimum required information:
- **Title/Description**: A text field containing the todo's primary content
- **Completion Status**: Initially set to incomplete (false) by default

The system SHALL store the todo permanently in the database and return a confirmation with the newly created todo's identifier.

### Requirement 2: Todo Ownership and Association

WHEN a todo is created, THE system SHALL automatically associate it with the authenticated user who created it using the user's unique identifier from their authentication token.

THE system SHALL ensure that each todo belongs to exactly one user and cannot be shared across multiple users in the basic system. NO todo can be created without explicit user association.

### Requirement 3: Todo Creation Response

WHEN a todo is successfully created, THE system SHALL return to the client:
- The unique identifier for the created todo (UUID format)
- All properties of the newly created todo including title, completion status, and timestamps
- A success confirmation message indicating the operation completed
- HTTP status code 201 (Created) indicating successful creation

THE client application SHALL display the newly created todo immediately in the user's list without requiring a page refresh.

### Requirement 4: Mandatory Field Validation for Creation

WHEN a user attempts to create a todo without providing a title/description, THE system SHALL reject the request and return a validation error.

IF the title/description field is empty (zero-length string) or contains only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines), THEN THE system SHALL reject the creation request immediately.

THE system SHALL provide a specific error message: "Todo title cannot be empty. Please enter a title for your todo."

### Requirement 5: Title Length Constraints

THE system SHALL accept todo titles with a minimum of 1 character and a maximum of 255 characters.

IF a user submits a title exceeding 255 characters, THEN THE system SHALL reject the creation and inform the user of the character limit with error message: "Todo title cannot exceed 255 characters. Current: [X] characters."

IF a user submits a title that is exactly 255 characters, THEN THE system SHALL accept the title without error and display remaining character count as "0 characters remaining."

### Requirement 6: Initial Status Assignment

WHEN a new todo is created by an authenticated user, THE system SHALL automatically assign the completion status as "incomplete" (false).

THE user SHALL NOT be able to specify a different initial status during creation. ATTEMPTS to set initial status to "completed" during creation SHALL be ignored, and the system SHALL always assign "incomplete" status.

### Requirement 7: Timestamp Assignment

WHEN a todo is created, THE system SHALL automatically capture the exact date and time of creation using the server's current UTC time.

THE creation timestamp SHALL be stored in ISO 8601 format with millisecond precision (e.g., "2024-10-16T08:30:45.123Z").

THE creation timestamp SHALL never be modifiable; it represents the permanent record of when the todo was created.

### Requirement 8: Duplicate Content Handling

THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to create multiple todos with identical titles.

THE system SHALL NOT enforce uniqueness constraints on todo content or titles. MULTIPLE todos with the same exact title and description SHALL be permitted to coexist.

EACH duplicate todo SHALL receive a unique internal identifier (UUID) so they can be individually managed, edited, and deleted.

### Requirement 9: Creation Under Network Conditions

WHEN a user creates a todo while experiencing poor network connectivity, THE system SHALL queue the creation request locally.

IF the creation request fails to reach the server within 30 seconds, THE system SHALL save the todo locally with "pending creation" status.

WHEN network connectivity is restored, THE system SHALL automatically attempt to transmit the pending todo to the server.

IF automatic transmission succeeds, THE system SHALL replace the local pending status with the server-assigned permanent todo ID and confirmation.

### Requirement 10: Rapid Successive Creation

WHEN an authenticated user rapidly creates multiple todos in succession (multiple requests within 1 second), THE system SHALL queue all creation requests and process them sequentially.

THE system SHALL return confirmation for each created todo with its unique identifier.

THE system SHALL display progress to the user: "Creating todos... (3 of 5 completed)" when multiple creations are in progress.

---

## Todo Reading and Display Requirements

### Requirement 11: Retrieve All User Todos

WHEN an authenticated user requests to view their todos, THE system SHALL retrieve all todos belonging to that user from the database.

THE system SHALL return all todos in a single comprehensive list, regardless of their completion status.

BOTH completed and incomplete todos SHALL be included in the retrieval response.

### Requirement 12: Todo List Organization and Display Order

THE system SHALL organize todos in a specific order when displaying the user's list:
- PRIMARY sort: Incomplete todos first, completed todos second
- SECONDARY sort: Within each group, sort by creation date with newest first (most recent first)

EXAMPLE: A list with creation times would display as:
1. Incomplete todo created today (newest incomplete)
2. Incomplete todo created yesterday
3. Completed todo created this morning (newest completed)
4. Completed todo created last week

THE display order SHALL be consistent and predictable to provide familiarity to users across multiple sessions.

### Requirement 13: Individual Todo Retrieval

WHEN an authenticated user requests a specific todo by its identifier, THE system SHALL retrieve that todo and return the complete todo data including:
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Title/description text
- Completion status (true for completed, false for incomplete)
- Creation timestamp (ISO 8601 format in UTC)
- Last modified timestamp (ISO 8601 format in UTC)

THE system SHALL verify that the requesting user owns the requested todo before returning the data.

IF the user does not own the requested todo, THE system SHALL deny access with authorization error (HTTP 403).

### Requirement 14: Empty List Handling

WHEN an authenticated user has no todos, THE system SHALL return an empty list (empty array) rather than an error response.

THE system SHALL clearly indicate to the user that they have no todos when applicable, with message: "You have no todos yet. Create your first todo to get started."

THE system SHALL prominently display a "Create New Todo" button or call-to-action to encourage users to create their first todo.

### Requirement 15: User Isolation in Display

THE system SHALL ensure that each authenticated user can ONLY view their own todos through the read/list endpoints.

WHEN a user requests their todo list, THE system SHALL return ONLY todos created by that user using their user ID from the authentication token.

IF a user attempts to view another user's todos (even through direct ID reference), THE system SHALL deny access immediately and return authorization error.

THE system SHALL NOT disclose whether the attempted todo exists or belongs to another user; the error SHALL be generic to prevent information disclosure.

### Requirement 16: Performance of Large Lists

WHEN a user has accumulated a large number of todos (100, 500, or 1000+ items), THE system SHALL retrieve and display them within acceptable timeframe.

THE system SHALL not degrade performance as the todo list grows. Response times SHALL remain consistent regardless of list size.

IF the frontend chooses to implement pagination or lazy loading for UI performance, THE system MAY provide todos in batches or pages through separate API endpoints.

THE system SHALL support retrieving all todos in a single request and SHALL also support pagination parameters (limit/offset or page/size) for flexible client implementation.

### Requirement 17: Real-Time List Synchronization

WHEN a user performs any modification to a todo (create, update, delete, status change), THE list of todos displayed to the user SHALL reflect the change immediately.

THE system SHALL transmit updated todo list to the client within 500 milliseconds of the operation completion.

IF the user performs multiple operations in succession, THE system SHALL update the display list after each operation completes.

---

## Todo Update Requirements

### Requirement 18: Edit Todo Title/Description

WHEN an authenticated user submits an update to an existing todo's title/description, THE system SHALL accept the new text content and update the todo permanently in persistent storage.

THE system SHALL validate the new title according to the same rules as creation (1-255 characters, non-empty, not whitespace-only).

ONLY the user who owns the todo SHALL be able to edit that todo's properties.

### Requirement 19: Update Completion Status

WHEN an authenticated user updates a todo's completion status, THE system SHALL toggle the status between completed (true) and incomplete (false).

THE system SHALL support updating the completion status independently from the title/description; either can be updated without modifying the other.

THE system SHALL support explicit status assignment (setting to "completed" OR "incomplete") not just toggling.

### Requirement 20: Update Response

WHEN a todo is successfully updated, THE system SHALL return to the client:
- The complete updated todo with all current properties
- Updated timestamp reflecting the modification (different from creation timestamp)
- HTTP status code 200 (OK) indicating successful update
- A success confirmation message

THE client application SHALL display the updated todo properties immediately in the list view without requiring manual refresh.

### Requirement 21: Update Authorization Validation

WHEN an authenticated user attempts to update a todo, THE system SHALL first verify that the todo belongs to that user (user's ID matches the todo's owner ID).

IF a user attempts to update a todo they do not own, THEN THE system SHALL deny the operation with HTTP 403 (Forbidden) authorization error.

THE system SHALL NOT reveal whether the todo exists or belongs to someone else; authorization errors SHALL be generic.

### Requirement 22: Non-Existent Todo Handling for Updates

IF a user attempts to update a todo that does not exist in the database, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 404 (Not Found) error with message: "The requested todo was not found or has been deleted."

THE system SHALL NOT create a new todo or modify any other data in response to an update on non-existent todo.

IF a user deletes a todo and immediately attempts to update it, THE system SHALL return "todo not found" error.

### Requirement 23: Partial Update Support

THE system SHALL support partial updates where a user can update either the title OR the completion status without requiring both properties to be submitted in the request.

WHEN only the title is provided in an update request, THE system SHALL update only the title and preserve the existing completion status.

WHEN only the completion status is provided, THE system SHALL update only the status and preserve the existing title.

WHEN both properties are provided, THE system SHALL update both simultaneously.

THE system SHALL update the modification timestamp for any update operation, regardless of which properties are changed.

### Requirement 24: Concurrent Update Handling

WHEN multiple update operations are submitted for the same todo nearly simultaneously, THE system SHALL apply them sequentially in the order received.

THE final state SHALL reflect the most recent update; earlier updates may be overwritten by later ones.

THE system SHALL use appropriate database locking mechanisms to ensure atomicity and prevent data corruption.

THE system SHALL not create conflicts or merge states; the last update wins strategy applies.

### Requirement 25: Update Validation Requirements

WHEN an updated todo title is provided, THE system SHALL validate:
- Title is not empty or whitespace-only
- Title length is between 1 and 255 characters
- Title does not contain only control characters

WHEN an updated completion status is provided, THE system SHALL validate:
- Status is either "completed" (true) or "incomplete" (false)
- Status is a valid boolean value
- Status is not null or undefined

IF validation fails, THE system SHALL reject the update and return validation error with specific message indicating what is invalid.

---

## Todo Delete Requirements

### Requirement 26: Delete Todo Operation

WHEN an authenticated user submits a delete request for a specific todo, THE system SHALL permanently remove that todo from the database.

The deletion SHALL be permanent and cannot be reversed through the application. NO undo functionality or soft delete is implemented in this minimal system.

THE system SHALL remove all associated data with the deleted todo including timestamps, title, and status information.

### Requirement 27: Delete Authorization Validation

WHEN an authenticated user attempts to delete a todo, THE system SHALL verify that the todo belongs to that user (user's ID matches the todo's owner ID).

IF a user attempts to delete a todo they do not own, THEN THE system SHALL deny the operation with HTTP 403 (Forbidden) authorization error.

THE system SHALL NOT reveal whether the todo exists or belongs to someone else; authorization errors SHALL be generic to prevent information disclosure.

### Requirement 28: Delete Confirmation Response

WHEN a todo is successfully deleted, THE system SHALL return to the client:
- A success confirmation message: "Todo deleted successfully"
- The identifier of the deleted todo (for reference)
- HTTP status code 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) indicating successful deletion
- No remaining data for the deleted todo in the response

THE client application SHALL immediately remove the deleted todo from the displayed list without requiring a page refresh.

### Requirement 29: Delete Non-Existent Todo

IF a user attempts to delete a todo that does not exist or has already been deleted, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 404 (Not Found) error.

THE system SHALL NOT throw an exception or enter an error state; deletion of non-existent todo SHALL be treated as idempotent.

THE system SHALL return success response to the user (no error displayed) when attempting to delete already-deleted todo; the result is the same (todo is not in system).

### Requirement 30: Bulk Delete Prevention

THE system SHALL prevent accidental bulk deletion by requiring individual delete requests for each todo.

WHEN a user attempts to delete multiple todos, EACH deletion action SHALL require a separate delete request and separate authorization check.

THE system SHALL NOT provide a "delete all completed todos" or "delete all todos" function in this minimal implementation.

---

## Todo Status Management

### Requirement 31: Status Toggle Operation

WHEN an authenticated user marks a todo as complete, THE system SHALL set the completion status to true and update the last modified timestamp to current UTC time.

WHEN an authenticated user marks a todo as incomplete, THE system SHALL set the completion status to false and update the last modified timestamp to current UTC time.

THE system SHALL update the modification timestamp regardless of whether status is being toggled to a different value or set to its current state.

### Requirement 32: Status State Clarity

THE system SHALL maintain exactly two distinct states for todo completion:
- **Incomplete** (false): Todo task has not been completed by the user
- **Completed** (true): Todo task has been completed by the user

THE system SHALL clearly reflect these states to the user when retrieving todos through visual distinction in the user interface (strikethrough, color change, checkbox state, etc.).

THE system SHALL NOT support intermediate states like "in progress," "pending," "paused," or any other status values.

### Requirement 33: Status Persistence

WHEN a user changes a todo's completion status, THE system SHALL immediately persist the status change to the database.

THE new status SHALL be permanently stored and SHALL be reflected when the user accesses their todo list in future sessions.

THE status change SHALL not be lost due to browser refreshes, application restarts, or other events.

### Requirement 34: Status History

THE system SHALL record the current status of each todo but SHALL NOT maintain a complete history of status changes (in this minimal implementation).

If a user marks a todo complete, then incomplete, then complete again, THE system SHALL simply reflect the current status as "complete."

No historical record of the previous status changes SHALL be maintained or accessible to the user.

---

## Data Validation Rules

### Requirement 35: Title/Description Validation

THE system SHALL validate that the title/description field:
- Is not null, undefined, or completely missing
- Is not an empty string (zero-length)
- Does not contain ONLY whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines)
- Is a text string data type (not boolean, array, or object)
- Does not exceed 255 characters in length
- Does not fall below 1 character minimum
- Accepts any valid UTF-8 encoded characters including letters, numbers, punctuation, emojis, and special characters

WHEN validating title length, THE system SHALL count actual characters as UTF-8 encoded strings, not bytes.

### Requirement 36: Completion Status Validation

THE system SHALL validate that the completion status field:
- Is a boolean data type with value of true or false only
- Is not null, undefined, or any other value
- Accepts only literal boolean values, not string representations like "true", "false", "1", or "0"

IF the system receives a string "true" or "false", THE system SHALL reject it as invalid data type and return validation error.

### Requirement 37: Identifier Validation

THE system SHALL validate that todo identifiers:
- Are unique within the entire system
- Follow UUID version 4 format (36 characters with hyphens)
- Are not modifiable by users under any circumstances
- Are automatically assigned by the system at creation time
- Are immutable throughout the todo's entire lifecycle

### Requirement 38: Timestamp Validation

THE system SHALL automatically manage timestamps with the following rules:
- **Created Timestamp**: Set once at todo creation and never modified by any operation
- **Modified Timestamp**: Updated each time the todo is modified; initially set to same value as created timestamp
- Both timestamps SHALL use ISO 8601 format in UTC timezone (e.g., "2024-10-16T14:30:45.123Z")
- Both timestamps SHALL include millisecond precision (three decimal places for fractional seconds)
- Timestamps SHALL never be in the future (before current server time)

### Requirement 39: User Association Validation

THE system SHALL validate that:
- Each todo is associated with exactly one user ID (no orphaned todos)
- A todo's user association cannot be changed after creation (immutable)
- Only the associated user can perform read, update, or delete operations on that todo
- Administrators can access any user's todos for system administration purposes

---

## Business Rules

### Requirement 40: One Todo List Per User

WHEN an authenticated user accesses their todos, THE system SHALL operate on a single personal todo list per user.

THE system SHALL not support shared todos between multiple users, collaborative editing, or multi-user todos in this minimum viable implementation.

EACH user's todos SHALL be completely separate and isolated from all other users' todos.

### Requirement 41: Todo Immutability of User Association

THE user association of a todo SHALL be immutable once the todo is created.

IF a todo is created by User A, it SHALL always belong to User A and cannot be reassigned to another user by any operation.

USER A can delete the todo, but that doesn't transfer it to another user; it simply removes it from the system.

### Requirement 42: Permanent Data Persistence

WHEN a todo is created or modified, THE system SHALL immediately persist the data to permanent database storage.

THE system SHALL not support draft or temporary todo states; all todos are permanent upon creation.

WHEN the application is closed and reopened, THE system SHALL retrieve all previously created todos in their last saved state.

WHEN the user's device or browser is restarted, THE system SHALL preserve all todo data without loss.

### Requirement 43: No Todo Archival or Soft Delete

THE system SHALL permanently delete todos when requested rather than archiving or soft-deleting them.

THERE SHALL be no archive function, trash bin, or recovery of permanently deleted todos.

ONCE a todo is deleted through the delete operation, IT SHALL NOT be accessible, listed, or recoverable through the application.

### Requirement 44: Operational Idempotency for Status Changes

WHEN marking a todo as complete multiple times without changing its status between completions, THE system SHALL return success each time without creating duplicate states or side effects.

IF a user sends "mark as complete" request for an already-completed todo, THE system SHALL:
- Return success response (HTTP 200)
- Keep status as completed
- Update the modification timestamp
- Not treat this as an error

REPEATED operations on the same state SHALL not produce different results than the first operation.

### Requirement 45: No Automatic Todo Deletion

THE system SHALL NOT automatically delete todos based on age, status, inactivity, or any other criteria.

TODOS SHALL persist indefinitely in the system unless explicitly deleted by the user.

A todo that was marked as completed 1 year ago SHALL still be accessible and available in the user's list indefinitely.

### Requirement 46: No Status Dependencies

THE system SHALL NOT enforce dependencies between todo statuses.

COMPLETING one todo SHALL NOT automatically affect, change, or modify the status of any other todo.

THERE SHALL be no concept of "blocking" todos, "dependent" todos, or "prerequisite" todos in this minimal system.

---

## Complete CRUD Operation Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create Todo Operation - Complete Specification

**User Objective**: Add a new task to their todo list

**Preconditions**:
- User is authenticated with valid session token
- User is on the application interface
- Create todo form is accessible and visible

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **User Initiation**: User opens the application and views their current todo list
2. **Action Selection**: User clicks the "Create New Todo", "Add Todo", or "+" button to initiate creation
3. **Form Display**: System displays a form with a text input field for the todo title/description
4. **User Input**: User enters a meaningful title or description (e.g., "Buy groceries for dinner")
5. **Form Submission**: User submits the form by clicking "Add Todo" button or pressing Enter key
6. **Server-Side Validation**: 
   - System validates the input title is not empty
   - System validates title is not longer than 255 characters
   - System validates title does not contain only whitespace
   - System verifies user is authenticated
7. **Todo Creation**: System creates the todo with:
   - Automatically generated unique identifier (UUID v4)
   - User-provided title
   - Completion status automatically set to "incomplete" (false)
   - Creation timestamp set to current server time in UTC
   - Associated with the authenticated user's user ID
   - Modification timestamp initialized to same value as creation timestamp
8. **Database Storage**: System saves the todo to persistent database
9. **Response Generation**: System returns success response containing the created todo object with all properties
10. **Client Update**: System displays the new todo in the user's list view at appropriate sort position (with other incomplete todos, sorted newest first)
11. **Confirmation Display**: System displays success confirmation message to the user
12. **Form Reset**: The input form clears and is immediately ready for the next todo entry
13. **User Feedback**: User receives visual confirmation that todo was created (notification, list update, sound if enabled)

**Data Returned on Success**:
```json
{
  "todoId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "title": "Buy groceries for dinner",
  "isCompleted": false,
  "createdAt": "2024-10-16T14:30:45.123Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-10-16T14:30:45.123Z"
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- THE new todo appears immediately in the todo list view
- THE todo displays the exact title the user entered
- THE todo shows "incomplete" or unchecked status indicator
- THE form clears and is ready for new entries
- THE user receives visual confirmation of successful creation
- THE todo receives unique ID that can be used for future operations
- THE todo is permanently saved and survives session/app restarts

**Error Paths**:

- **If user enters empty title**:
  1. System displays validation error message "Todo title cannot be empty"
  2. System prevents form submission and keeps form open
  3. Form data is preserved so user can correct without re-entering
  4. User corrects input and resubmits
  5. System creates todo on next successful validation

- **If user enters title exceeding 255 characters**:
  1. System displays error "Todo title cannot exceed 255 characters"
  2. System shows current character count and limit
  3. System prevents form submission
  4. User shortens the title
  5. System creates todo after title is within limit

- **If network error occurs during creation**:
  1. System detects connection failure
  2. System displays error "Unable to create todo. Please check your connection and try again."
  3. User's form input is preserved in temporary local storage
  4. User can retry after connection is restored
  5. System automatically attempts retry when connection restored
  6. Todo is created on successful retry

- **If database is full or quota exceeded**:
  1. System displays error "Storage is full. Please delete some todos and try again."
  2. System prevents creation
  3. User deletes some completed todos to free space
  4. System allows creation after space is available

---

### Workflow 2: Read/Retrieve Todos Operation - Complete Specification

**User Objective**: See all their todos to understand their task list and current workload

**Preconditions**:
- User is authenticated
- User has previously created one or more todos (or zero todos for empty state)
- User is viewing the main dashboard/todo list view

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **User Navigation**: User opens or navigates to the main todo list page/dashboard
2. **Request Initiation**: System automatically requests todos for the authenticated user (triggered on page load)
3. **Database Retrieval**: System queries database for all todos belonging to the authenticated user
4. **Query Execution**: System retrieves todos from persistent storage matching the user's ID
5. **Data Organization**: 
   - System sorts todos with incomplete first, completed second
   - Within each status group, sorts by creation date (newest first)
   - System prepares complete todo objects with all properties
6. **Response Preparation**: System formats retrieved todos as list/array of todo objects
7. **Client Reception**: Client receives list of todos (may be empty array if user has zero todos)
8. **Display Rendering**: System renders each todo with:
   - Todo title/description
   - Completion status indicator (visual distinction: unchecked/checked, normal/strikethrough, etc.)
   - Timestamp information (if shown to user)
   - Action buttons (edit, delete, mark complete/incomplete)
   - All interactive controls for todo management
9. **Empty State Handling**: If user has no todos:
   - System displays empty state message "No todos yet"
   - System shows encouragement to create first todo
   - System displays prominent "Create New Todo" button
10. **Large List Handling**: If user has many todos (50+):
   - System implements pagination or infinite scroll as needed
   - System loads todos in batches for performance
   - System allows navigation through pages or scrolling to load more
11. **Display Completion**: System displays fully rendered todo list to user within 2 seconds
12. **User Interaction Ready**: User can immediately interact with any todo (click edit, delete, mark complete)

**Data Returned on Success**:
```json
[
  {
    "todoId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "title": "Buy groceries",
    "isCompleted": false,
    "createdAt": "2024-10-16T14:30:45.123Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-10-16T14:30:45.123Z"
  },
  {
    "todoId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    "title": "Complete project report",
    "isCompleted": false,
    "createdAt": "2024-10-16T10:15:20.456Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-10-16T10:15:20.456Z"
  },
  {
    "todoId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002",
    "title": "Call dentist",
    "isCompleted": true,
    "createdAt": "2024-10-15T09:00:00.789Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-10-16T11:30:10.234Z"
  }
]
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ALL todos created by the user are displayed in the list
- COMPLETED and incomplete todos are clearly visually distinguished
- EACH todo shows its title, status, and available action buttons
- THE list is organized logically (incomplete first, then completed; newest first within each group)
- THE data loads within expected timeframe (< 2 seconds for typical todo counts)
- USERS can quickly identify which todos are complete and which need attention
- THE list updates immediately after any todo operation (create, update, delete)
- EMPTY state is handled gracefully with encouragement to create first todo

**Error Paths**:

- **If user has no todos**:
  1. System displays empty state message "No todos yet. Create your first todo!"
  2. System prominently displays "Create New Todo" button
  3. No errors displayed
  4. User can immediately click to create first todo

- **If database query fails**:
  1. System displays error "Unable to load your todos. Please refresh the page."
  2. System attempts automatic retry
  3. If retry succeeds, todos are displayed
  4. If retry fails, user can manually refresh page or try again later
  5. System may display cached todos if available while reconnecting

- **If network connection is lost**:
  1. System displays "No internet connection. Displaying cached todos."
  2. System shows previously loaded todos from local cache
  3. System indicates that updates will sync when connection restored
  4. User can still view todos but cannot create/edit/delete until online

- **If todos load very slowly (large list, 1000+ items)**:
  1. System displays loading indicator "Loading your todos..."
  2. System implements pagination or lazy loading
  3. System displays first batch of todos quickly
  4. Additional todos load as user scrolls or navigates pages
  5. Performance remains acceptable even with large dataset

---

### Workflow 3: Update Todo Operation - Complete Specification

**User Objective**: Edit an existing todo's title or mark it as complete/incomplete

**Preconditions**:
- User is authenticated
- User is viewing their todo list
- At least one todo exists that user owns
- User has identified the specific todo to update

**Step-by-Step Process for Title Update**:

1. **Todo Selection**: User views their todo list and identifies a todo they want to edit
2. **Edit Activation**: User clicks "Edit" button or similar action for the specific todo
3. **Form Display**: System opens an edit form or inline editing interface showing:
   - Current todo title in an input field
   - Action buttons: "Save" and "Cancel"
   - Character count indicator (current/max)
4. **User Edit**: User modifies the todo title as needed:
   - User may add additional details to clarify task
   - User may correct spelling or grammar
   - User may completely change the title
   - User may clear and start over
5. **Form Submission**: User clicks "Save" button or presses Enter to confirm changes
6. **Server-Side Validation**:
   - System validates that user is authenticated
   - System validates that the new title is not empty
   - System validates title length is 1-255 characters
   - System verifies authenticated user owns this todo
7. **Ownership Verification**: If user does not own the todo:
   - System denies operation with authorization error
   - System displays "Unauthorized to edit this todo"
   - No update occurs
8. **Update Processing**: System updates the todo with new title
9. **Timestamp Update**: System automatically updates modification timestamp to current UTC time
10. **Database Storage**: System saves updated todo to persistent database
11. **Response Return**: System returns updated todo object with all current properties
12. **Display Update**: System returns to list view and displays the updated todo with new title
13. **Confirmation**: System displays success message "Todo updated successfully"

**Step-by-Step Process for Status Update**:

1. **Todo Viewing**: User views their todo list
2. **Status Change**: User clicks the checkbox, complete button, or status toggle for a specific todo
3. **Status Determination**: 
   - If todo is currently incomplete, user action changes it to complete
   - If todo is currently complete, user action changes it to incomplete
4. **Status Update**: System updates the todo's completion status in opposite state
5. **Timestamp Update**: System updates modification timestamp to current UTC time
6. **Database Save**: System saves updated status to database
7. **Display Refresh**: System immediately updates the todo's visual appearance:
   - Completed todos show strikethrough or grayed out styling
   - Incomplete todos show normal styling
8. **List Reorganization**: System may reorganize list if status change affects sort order:
   - If todo changed from incomplete to complete, it moves to completed section
   - If todo changed from complete to incomplete, it moves to incomplete section
9. **Confirmation**: System displays brief confirmation of status change

**Data Update Example**:
```json
// Original todo
{
  "todoId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "title": "Buy milk",
  "isCompleted": false,
  "createdAt": "2024-10-16T08:30:45.123Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-10-16T08:30:45.123Z"
}

// After edit request to change title
{
  "todoId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "title": "Buy milk and eggs",
  "isCompleted": false,
  "createdAt": "2024-10-16T08:30:45.123Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-10-16T14:45:20.567Z"  // Updated timestamp
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- THE todo title/status is updated to the new value provided by user
- THE change is immediately visible in the list view
- THE modification is persistent (persists across page refresh and sessions)
- THE todo's completion status is not affected by title edits (and vice versa)
- THE modification timestamp is updated to current time
- THE creation timestamp remains unchanged
- THE user receives confirmation of successful edit
- ONLY the owner of the todo can edit it

**Error Paths**:

- **If user enters empty title**:
  1. System displays validation error "Todo title cannot be empty"
  2. System keeps the edit form open for correction
  3. System preserves existing title as fallback
  4. User corrects input and resubmits
  5. System saves changes on successful validation

- **If user enters title exceeding 255 characters**:
  1. System displays error "Todo title exceeds maximum length (255 characters)"
  2. System shows current character count and limit
  3. System keeps edit form open
  4. User shortens the title
  5. System saves after title is within acceptable length

- **If user is not the owner**:
  1. System detects authorization failure
  2. System displays error "Unauthorized to edit this todo"
  3. No update occurs
  4. User is returned to their own todo list

- **If todo no longer exists**:
  1. System detects that todo cannot be found
  2. System displays error "This todo no longer exists or has been deleted"
  3. System removes the todo from the displayed list
  4. User is returned to main todo list

- **If network fails during update**:
  1. System detects connection loss
  2. System displays error "Unable to save changes. Please try again."
  3. System preserves the edited content in temporary storage
  4. User can retry when connection is restored
  5. Changes are persisted on successful retry

- **If user clicks Cancel**:
  1. System closes the edit form without saving
  2. System returns to list view
  3. Original todo title/status remains unchanged
  4. No persistence or update occurs

### Workflow 4: Delete Todo Operation - Complete Specification

**User Objective**: Remove a todo from their list permanently

**Preconditions**:
- User is authenticated
- User is viewing their todo list
- At least one todo exists that user owns
- User has identified the specific todo to delete

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Todo Selection**: User views their todo list
2. **Delete Activation**: User clicks the "Delete" button, trash icon, or similar delete action for a specific todo
3. **Confirmation Display**: System displays a confirmation dialog with:
   - Message: "Are you sure you want to delete this todo? This action cannot be undone."
   - Todo title displayed for user to confirm they're deleting the correct item
   - "Confirm Delete" button
   - "Cancel" button for changing mind
4. **User Confirmation**: User clicks "Confirm Delete" button to proceed with deletion
5. **Authorization Check**:
   - System verifies user is authenticated
   - System verifies the user owns this todo
   - If authorization fails, system displays error and aborts deletion
6. **Delete Execution**: System removes the todo record completely from the database
7. **Deletion Verification**: System confirms deletion was successful in database
8. **Response**: System returns success confirmation to client
9. **Display Update**: System removes the deleted todo from the displayed list immediately
10. **Confirmation Message**: System displays confirmation "Todo deleted successfully"

**If User Cancels**:
1. User clicks "Cancel" button in confirmation dialog
2. System closes the dialog without performing any deletion
3. System returns to the todo list
4. Todo remains in list completely unchanged
5. No database changes occur

**Success Criteria**:
- THE todo is completely removed from the system and list
- THE deleted todo does not appear anywhere in the application
- THE deletion is permanent and immediate (no undo within app)
- THE user receives clear confirmation that deletion was successful
- ONLY the owner of the todo can delete it
- CONFIRMATION is required before deletion (prevents accidental deletion)
- OTHER todos in the list are not affected by this deletion

**Error Paths**:

- **If user is not the owner**:
  1. System detects authorization failure
  2. System displays error "Unauthorized to delete this todo"
  3. Todo remains in list unchanged
  4. Deletion does not occur

- **If todo no longer exists**:
  1. System attempts to delete but cannot find the todo
  2. System treats as successful deletion (idempotent operation)
  3. System removes todo from UI if still displaying it
  4. User receives confirmation "Todo deleted successfully"

- **If database connection fails**:
  1. System detects connection error during deletion
  2. System displays error "Unable to delete todo. Please try again."
  3. Todo remains in database and list
  4. User can retry deletion when connection is restored

- **If user cancels the confirmation**:
  1. System closes confirmation dialog
  2. System returns to list view
  3. Todo remains completely unchanged
  4. No deletion occurs

## Constraint Specifications

### Minimum Feature Set Constraint

THE system SHALL provide only essential CRUD operations for todo management in this implementation.

THE system SHALL NOT include the following features:
- ❌ Due dates or deadline management
- ❌ Priority levels or urgency indicators
- ❌ Categories, tags, or custom labels
- ❌ Recurring or repeating todos
- ❌ Todo dependencies or subtasks
- ❌ Collaboration or sharing features
- ❌ Real-time synchronization across multiple devices
- ❌ Rich text formatting or markdown support
- ❌ Attachments or file uploads
- ❌ Notifications or reminders
- ❌ Comments or notes sections
- ❌ Time tracking or estimation

### Single User Focus Constraint

THE system SHALL be designed for single-user usage within a session.

While the system technically supports multiple users through role-based access control, EACH user operates independently on their own todos without cross-user visibility or interaction.

### Data Limits Constraint

THE system SHALL support a minimum of 1,000 todos per user without performance degradation.

THE system SHALL accept todo titles up to 255 characters as specified in data requirements.

---

## Summary of Functional Requirements

The Todo List Application provides authenticated users with core functionality to:

1. **Create** new todos with title and automatic incomplete status
2. **Read/Retrieve** all personal todos in organized list view
3. **Update** todo titles and completion status independently
4. **Delete** todos permanently when no longer needed

All operations are user-specific (users can only access their own todos), permanently persisted to the database, and validated according to business rules specified in this document. The system maintains data integrity through authorization checks and comprehensive validation to ensure only valid todos are stored and only authorized users can access their data.

The minimal set of features keeps the application focused and simple while providing the essential todo management capabilities users require for personal task organization and tracking.
