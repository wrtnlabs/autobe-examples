# User Scenarios for Todo List Application

## User Scenario Overview

This document describes the primary and secondary user scenarios for the Todo list application, illustrating how authenticated users interact with the system in real-world situations. These scenarios form the foundation for system implementation and testing, showing the step-by-step interactions between users and the application.

### Scope and Context

The scenarios documented here focus on authenticated users who have successfully logged into the system. Each scenario describes:

- The user's objective and motivation
- The step-by-step actions the user takes
- The system's responses and behavior
- Expected outcomes and success criteria
- Validation checks and error handling

### Scenario Format

Each scenario follows a consistent structure:

- **Scenario Title**: Clear description of the user's goal
- **User Role**: Which user role performs this scenario
- **User Goal**: What the user wants to accomplish
- **Preconditions**: System state before the scenario begins
- **Steps**: Numbered sequence of user actions and system responses
- **Success Criteria**: What constitutes successful completion
- **Alternative Paths**: What happens if things go differently

## Primary User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Creating a New Todo

**User Role**: Authenticated User

**User Goal**: Add a new task to their todo list because they want to track something they need to do.

**Preconditions**:
- User is logged into the application
- User has navigated to the todo list view
- The create todo form is accessible

**Steps**:

1. User opens the application and views their current todo list
2. User clicks the "Create New Todo" or similar action button
3. System displays a form with a text field for the todo title/description
4. User enters a meaningful title (e.g., "Buy groceries for dinner")
5. User submits the form by clicking "Add Todo" or pressing Enter
6. System validates the input:
   - WHEN user submits a todo creation request, THE system SHALL validate that the title field is not empty
   - WHEN user submits a todo creation request, THE system SHALL validate that the title does not exceed 500 characters
   - WHEN user submits a todo creation request, THE system SHALL validate that the title does not contain invalid characters or encoding
7. System creates the todo with:
   - A unique identifier
   - The user-provided title
   - Completion status set to "incomplete"
   - A creation timestamp
   - Associated with the authenticated user's account
8. System saves the todo to the database
9. System displays the new todo in the list view with incomplete status
10. System displays a success confirmation message to the user
11. The form clears and is ready for the next todo entry

**Success Criteria**:
- WHEN a user creates a new todo with valid input, THE new todo SHALL appear immediately in the todo list
- THE todo SHALL display the exact title the user entered
- THE todo SHALL show "incomplete" or similar status indicator

- THE system SHALL prevent submission and keep the form open
- THE user SHALL correct the input and try again

**Path B: Title Exceeds Maximum Length**
- WHEN user enters a title exceeding 500 characters, THE system SHALL display an error indicating the limit
- THE system MAY auto-truncate or prevent submission depending on implementation
- THE user SHALL be informed of the character limit

**Path C: Network or Database Error During Creation**

### Performance Expectations

Based on scenarios, the system SHALL meet:
- **Create Operation**: WHEN user creates a todo, THE system SHALL complete within 1 second
- **Read/View Operation**: WHEN user views their list, THE system SHALL load initial view within 2 seconds
- **Update Operation**: WHEN user updates a todo, THE system SHALL complete within 1 second
- **Delete Operation**: WHEN user deletes a todo, THE system SHALL complete within 1 second
- **List Display**: WHEN system displays many todos, THE system SHALL remain responsive even with 100+ items
- **Status Change**: WHEN user changes status, THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

## Scenario Testing Recommendations

### Test Coverage by Scenario

All scenarios documented in this section should be covered by functional and integration testing before system release:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual operations (create, read, update, delete, status toggle)
2. **Integration Tests**: Complete workflows from user action to UI update
3. **Error Handling Tests**: All alternative paths and error scenarios
4. **Performance Tests**: Large dataset handling and response time validation
5. **Concurrency Tests**: Multiple operations and cross-device synchronization
6. **Data Persistence Tests**: Session management and data recovery

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

All success criteria specified for each scenario must be validated in testing to confirm the implementation meets business requirements.
