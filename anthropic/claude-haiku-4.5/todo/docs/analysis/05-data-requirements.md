# Data Requirements for Todo List Application

## Data Requirements Overview

This document specifies all data requirements for the Todo list application, defining the structure, properties, data types, validation rules, and constraints for todos. The data model has been designed to support the minimum viable functionality of a todo list application with essential CRUD operations while ensuring data integrity and persistence.

The Todo list application operates as a single-user system focused on simplicity and core functionality. All data requirements are driven by the need to support basic todo management operations: creation, reading, updating, and deletion of todos.

### Scope
This document covers:
- Complete Todo entity structure and properties
- Data types and format specifications for all fields
- Validation requirements for data integrity
- Constraints and limits for todo properties
- Data lifecycle and persistence requirements
- Business rules governing todo data

### Out of Scope
- User authentication data (not required for single-user system)
- User profile information (not applicable to minimal system)
- Audit logs and historical data (beyond minimum requirements)
- Analytics data (not part of core functionality)

## Todo Entity Properties

The Todo entity represents a single task or action item in the application. Each todo is a discrete unit of work that users can create, view, manage, and delete.

### Complete Property List

The following table defines all properties that comprise a Todo entity:

| Property Name | Data Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| todoId | String (UUID) | Yes | Unique identifier for the todo |
| title | String | Yes | The main title or name of the todo |
| description | String | No | Detailed description or notes about the todo |
| isCompleted | Boolean | Yes | Flag indicating whether the todo is marked as complete |
| createdAt | DateTime (ISO 8601) | Yes | Timestamp when the todo was created |
| updatedAt | DateTime (ISO 8601) | Yes | Timestamp when the todo was last modified |

---

## Required Fields

Required fields are properties that MUST be present for every todo in the system. A todo cannot exist without these fields.

### todoId (Unique Identifier)

**Data Type**: String (UUID format)

**Purpose**: Serves as the unique identifier for each todo in the system, enabling the system to distinguish between different todos and track individual items.

**Format**: UUID version 4 (36 characters including hyphens, e.g., "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")

**Generation**: WHEN a user creates a new todo, THE system SHALL automatically generate a unique UUID version 4 identifier and assign it to the todo.

**Immutability**: THE todoId SHALL NOT change after the todo is created. This identifier is permanent and immutable throughout the todo's lifecycle.

**Usage**: THE todoId SHALL be used in all operations to reference and identify specific todos (read, update, delete operations).

### title (Todo Title)

**Data Type**: String

**Purpose**: Contains the main title or summary of the todo, representing what the user needs to do.

**Length Constraints**: 
- Minimum length: 1 character
- Maximum length: 255 characters

**Requirements**:
- WHEN a user creates a new todo, THE title field SHALL be required and cannot be empty.
- WHEN a user updates a todo, THE title field SHALL be required and cannot be changed to empty.
- THE title SHALL contain the user's description of the task.

**Content Guidelines**: THE title may contain any printable characters including letters, numbers, spaces, and common punctuation marks.

**Example Values**: "Buy groceries", "Complete project report", "Call dentist for appointment", "Finish quarterly review"

### isCompleted (Completion Status)

**Data Type**: Boolean

**Purpose**: Tracks whether the todo has been marked as complete or remains incomplete. This property represents the current status of the task.

**Valid Values**: 
- `true`: The todo is marked as completed
- `false`: The todo is marked as incomplete (default state)

**Default Value**: WHEN a new todo is created, THE isCompleted field SHALL default to `false` (incomplete state).

**Requirements**:
- THE isCompleted field SHALL always have a value (either true or false).
- WHEN a user marks a todo as complete, THE isCompleted value SHALL be set to `true`.
- WHEN a user marks a todo as incomplete, THE isCompleted value SHALL be set to `false`.
- THE isCompleted field SHALL be used to distinguish between completed and incomplete todos in the system.

**State Transitions**: THE isCompleted value may be changed from `false` to `true` (marking complete) or from `true` to `false` (marking incomplete) at any time.

### createdAt (Creation Timestamp)

**Data Type**: DateTime (ISO 8601 format)

**Purpose**: Records the exact date and time when the todo was created, providing temporal metadata and audit trail information.

**Format**: ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-10-16T08:30:45.123Z")

**Timezone**: All timestamps SHALL be stored in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) timezone.

**Generation**: WHEN a user creates a new todo, THE system SHALL automatically record the current date and time in ISO 8601 format and assign it to the createdAt field.

**Immutability**: THE createdAt timestamp SHALL NOT be modified after the todo is created. This value remains permanent and represents the original creation time.

**Precision**: Timestamps SHALL include millisecond precision (three decimal places for fractional seconds).

### updatedAt (Last Modified Timestamp)

**Data Type**: DateTime (ISO 8601 format)

**Purpose**: Records the most recent date and time when the todo was modified, tracking when changes were last made to the todo.

**Format**: ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-10-16T09:45:30.456Z")

**Timezone**: All timestamps SHALL be stored in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) timezone.

**Initial Value**: WHEN a new todo is created, THE updatedAt field SHALL initially be set to the same value as createdAt.

**Update Behavior**: WHEN any property of the todo is modified (title, description, or isCompleted), THE updatedAt field SHALL be automatically updated to the current date and time.

**Precision**: Timestamps SHALL include millisecond precision (three decimal places for fractional seconds).

**Example Scenario**: If a todo is created at "2024-10-16T08:30:45.123Z" and then the user changes the title three hours later, the updatedAt field would be changed to "2024-10-16T11:30:20.789Z".

---

## Optional Fields

Optional fields enhance the todo's functionality but are not strictly required for the todo to exist in the system. However, when provided, they must conform to the specifications below.

### description (Todo Description)

**Data Type**: String

**Purpose**: Provides additional details, notes, or context about the todo beyond the title. This field allows users to store more detailed information about what needs to be done.

**Length Constraints**:
- Minimum length: 0 characters (field can be empty)
- Maximum length: 2000 characters

**Requirement**: THE description field is optional and may be left empty or not provided.

**Content Guidelines**: THE description may contain any printable characters including letters, numbers, spaces, punctuation, and line breaks (newline characters).

**Usage**:
- WHEN a user creates a new todo, THE description field may be omitted or left empty.
- WHEN a user updates a todo, THE description field may be changed, left empty, or removed.
- WHEN a todo is retrieved, IF the description was not provided, THE system SHALL return either an empty string or omit the field entirely.

**Example Values**: 
- "Buy milk, eggs, and bread from the grocery store"
- "Submit the quarterly financial report with all supporting documentation by end of day"
- "Call to confirm appointment time and location"
- "" (empty string if no description provided)

---

## Data Types and Formats

### String Data Type

**Encoding**: All string fields SHALL be encoded in UTF-8 format.

**Character Support**: Strings MAY contain any valid UTF-8 character including letters (English and international), numbers, spaces, punctuation, and special characters.

**Whitespace Handling**: 
- Leading and trailing whitespace in string fields SHOULD be preserved as provided by the user.
- Multiple consecutive spaces within strings SHALL be preserved.

### Boolean Data Type

**Representation**: THE Boolean type has exactly two possible values: `true` and `false`.

**Format**: In JSON representation, Boolean values SHALL be written as lowercase `true` or `false` without quotes.

**No Null Values**: THE Boolean field (isCompleted) SHALL always have a definite value and SHALL NOT be null or undefined.

### DateTime Data Type (ISO 8601)

**Standard**: All datetime values SHALL follow the ISO 8601 standard format.

**Format Specification**: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`

**Components**:
- `YYYY`: Four-digit year (e.g., 2024)
- `MM`: Two-digit month (01-12)
- `DD`: Two-digit day (01-31)
- `T`: Literal character separating date and time
- `HH`: Two-digit hour in 24-hour format (00-23)
- `mm`: Two-digit minutes (00-59)
- `ss`: Two-digit seconds (00-59)
- `.sss`: Three-digit milliseconds (000-999)
- `Z`: Literal character indicating UTC timezone

**Example**: "2024-10-16T14:30:45.123Z" represents October 16, 2024, at 14:30:45.123 in UTC.

**Timezone Requirement**: All datetime values SHALL be stored and transmitted in UTC timezone. The `Z` suffix is mandatory and indicates UTC.

### UUID Data Type

**Standard**: todoId SHALL use UUID version 4 (randomly generated UUID).

**Format**: 36 characters total with hyphens in pattern: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

**Example**: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

**Characteristics**: 
- UUID v4 is randomly generated and cryptographically secure
- Globally unique across the entire system
- No sequential or predictable pattern

---

## Validation Rules

Validation rules ensure data integrity and consistency. These rules are applied when todos are created or updated.

### Title Validation

**Rule 1 - Required and Non-Empty**:
WHEN a new todo is being created, THE system SHALL require the title field to be provided and SHALL NOT accept empty or whitespace-only strings as valid title values.

**Rule 2 - Length Constraint**:
WHEN a todo is created or updated with a title value, THE system SHALL validate that the title string length is between 1 and 255 characters (inclusive).

**Rule 3 - Character Validation**:
WHEN a todo is created or updated with a title value, THE system SHALL accept any valid UTF-8 characters including letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation marks.

**Rule 4 - No Null Values**:
WHEN a todo exists in the system, THE title field SHALL never be null or undefined. It must always contain a valid string value.

**Rule 5 - Trim Whitespace for Validation**:
WHEN validating title length, THE system SHALL consider the actual characters provided, preserving leading and trailing spaces as intentional user input.

### Description Validation

**Rule 1 - Optional Field**:
WHEN a new todo is created, THE description field is optional and may be omitted or provided with an empty string.

**Rule 2 - Length Constraint**:
IF a description is provided, THE system SHALL validate that the description string length does not exceed 2000 characters.

**Rule 3 - Character Validation**:
WHEN a description is provided, THE system SHALL accept any valid UTF-8 characters including letters, numbers, spaces, punctuation, and newline characters.

**Rule 4 - Empty String Handling**:
WHEN a todo has an empty description, THE system SHALL either store the empty string or omit the field, handling both representations consistently.

### isCompleted Validation

**Rule 1 - Boolean Value Required**:
WHEN a todo is created or updated, THE isCompleted field SHALL be a valid Boolean value (either `true` or `false`).

**Rule 2 - Default State**:
WHEN a new todo is created, IF the isCompleted value is not explicitly provided, THE system SHALL automatically set it to `false` (incomplete state).

**Rule 3 - No Null Values**:
WHEN a todo exists in the system, THE isCompleted field SHALL never be null or undefined. It must always be either `true` or `false`.

### todoId Validation

**Rule 1 - UUID Format**:
THE todoId field SHALL be a valid UUID version 4 in the format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` (36 characters with hyphens).

**Rule 2 - Automatic Generation**:
WHEN a new todo is created, THE system SHALL automatically generate a unique UUID v4 value. The user SHALL NOT provide this value.

**Rule 3 - Uniqueness**:
THE todoId value SHALL be unique across the entire system. No two todos SHALL have the same todoId.

**Rule 4 - Immutability**:
THE todoId SHALL NOT be modified after the todo is created. Attempts to change this value SHALL be rejected.

### Timestamp Validation

**Rule 1 - ISO 8601 Format**:
THE createdAt and updatedAt fields SHALL follow the ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`.

**Rule 2 - UTC Timezone**:
THE timestamps SHALL always be in UTC timezone, indicated by the `Z` suffix. No other timezone formats SHALL be accepted.

**Rule 3 - Valid Date and Time**:
WHEN timestamps are validated, THE system SHALL ensure the date and time values are valid (e.g., February 30th is invalid, hour 25 is invalid).

**Rule 4 - Automatic Generation**:
THE createdAt and updatedAt timestamps SHALL be automatically generated by the system. Users SHALL NOT provide these values.

**Rule 5 - Millisecond Precision**:
THE timestamps SHALL include millisecond precision with exactly three decimal places (`.sss` format).

---

## Data Lifecycle

### Creation Phase

WHEN a user creates a new todo, THE following process occurs:

1. THE system receives a request containing at minimum the `title` field
2. THE system validates the title field (required, length 1-255 characters)
3. THE system validates any optional `description` field if provided (max 2000 characters)
4. THE system validates the optional `isCompleted` field if provided (must be Boolean)
5. IF all validations pass, THE system automatically generates:
   - A unique UUID v4 for the `todoId` field
   - The current UTC timestamp for `createdAt`
   - The current UTC timestamp for `updatedAt`
6. THE system stores the complete todo record in the database
7. THE system returns the created todo with all properties to the user

**Example Creation Data**:
```json
{
  "todoId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "title": "Buy groceries",
  "description": "Milk, eggs, bread, and vegetables",
  "isCompleted": false,
  "createdAt": "2024-10-16T08:30:45.123Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-10-16T08:30:45.123Z"
}
```

### Reading Phase

WHEN a user reads or retrieves a todo, THE following occurs:

- THE system retrieves the todo record from the database using the todoId
- THE system returns all properties of the todo exactly as stored
- THE system preserves all data exactly, including timestamps and completion status
- THE system does not modify any data during read operations
- THE createdAt and updatedAt timestamps remain unchanged

### Update Phase

WHEN a user updates a todo, THE following process occurs:

1. THE system receives an update request with a todoId and properties to modify
2. THE system validates the properties being updated using the same validation rules as creation
3. THE system identifies which properties are changing
4. THE system updates only the properties that were provided in the update request
5. THE system automatically updates the `updatedAt` timestamp to the current UTC time
6. THE system preserves the original `createdAt` timestamp (does not change)
7. THE system does not modify the `todoId` (immutable)
8. THE system stores the updated todo record in the database
9. THE system returns the updated todo to the user

**Updateable Properties**: title, description, isCompleted

**Non-Updateable Properties**: todoId, createdAt

**Example Update Scenario**: If a user changes the title from "Buy groceries" to "Buy groceries and cook dinner", the updatedAt timestamp is changed to the current time, but createdAt remains the original creation time.

### Deletion Phase

WHEN a user deletes a todo, THE following occurs:

1. THE system receives a delete request with a todoId
2. THE system verifies the todo exists in the database
3. THE system removes the entire todo record from the database
4. THE system confirms the deletion to the user
5. THE deleted todo record is no longer retrievable
6. THE todoId becomes available for reuse only in the sense that UUIDs are for future todos, though UUID collision is extremely unlikely

### Data Persistence

**Storage Requirement**: THE system SHALL persist all todo data in a permanent database so that todos remain available after the application is closed and reopened.

**Consistency**: WHEN todos are stored and retrieved, THE data SHALL be consistent and unchanged from what was stored (no data loss or corruption).

**Backup**: THE system SHALL maintain todo data reliably and prevent accidental or intentional loss of user data.

---

## Data Integrity and Business Rules

### Consistency Requirements

**Timestamp Relationship**:
WHILE a todo exists in the system, THE updatedAt timestamp SHALL always be greater than or equal to the createdAt timestamp. THE createdAt SHALL never be greater than updatedAt.

**Status Consistency**:
WHILE a todo exists, THE isCompleted field SHALL always be either `true` or `false`. There SHALL be no intermediate or undefined states.

**Identifier Uniqueness**:
ACROSS all todos in the system, EACH todoId SHALL be unique. No two different todos SHALL have the same todoId.

### Referential Integrity

THE system SHALL maintain referential integrity by:
- Ensuring every todo has a valid, complete set of required fields
- Preventing orphaned or incomplete todo records in the database
- Validating all data before storage

### Data Isolation

WHILE the system operates as a single-user system, all user data SHALL be treated as belonging to that single user. THE system SHALL maintain clear separation of todo data from any other system data.

---

## Performance and Storage Considerations

### Data Volume Expectations

THE system is designed to handle reasonable todo list sizes for a single user. While there is no strict hard limit, typical users may maintain hundreds to thousands of todos without performance degradation.

### Storage Efficiency

**Text Encoding**: String fields SHALL be stored using UTF-8 encoding for efficient storage and international character support.

**Timestamp Precision**: Timestamps are stored with millisecond precision, providing sufficient granularity for tracking modification times.

**Boolean Optimization**: Boolean fields use minimal storage (1 byte typically) compared to string representations.

### Query Performance

THE system SHALL optimize data retrieval to support:
- Quick retrieval of individual todos by todoId
- Fast listing of all todos
- Efficient filtering of todos by isCompleted status
- Rapid sorting of todos by creation or modification time
