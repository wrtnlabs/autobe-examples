/**
 * Test the complete workflow where an administrator reviews a platform
 * suspension appeal and overturns the suspension, restoring the member's
 * platform access.
 *
 * This test validates the full appeal reversal process:
 *
 * 1. Create member and administrator accounts
 * 2. Administrator issues a platform suspension
 * 3. Suspended member submits an appeal
 * 4. Administrator reviews appeal with 'overturn' decision
 * 5. Verify suspension is deactivated and member can access platform again
 *
 * Validates requirements R-APP-018 (suspension lift within 1 minute), R-APP-021
 * (appellant notification), and R-APP-022 (decision communication).
