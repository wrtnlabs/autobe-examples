# Voting System Requirements

## 1. Voting System Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

The voting system is a core engagement mechanism that allows users to signal the quality and relevance of content within the community platform. Through upvotes and downvotes, users collectively determine which posts and comments rise to prominence and which sink into obscurity.

### 1.2 Business Purpose

The voting system serves multiple critical business functions:

- **Content Quality Signal**: Votes indicate community assessment of content value, helping surface high-quality contributions while suppressing low-quality or irrelevant content
- **Content Ranking Mechanism**: Vote scores directly influence how content appears in various sorting algorithms (hot, top, controversial), shaping user experience
- **User Reputation System**: Votes on a user's content contribute to their karma score, creating a reputation system that rewards valuable contributions
- **Community Self-Moderation**: Voting enables the community to self-regulate content quality before moderator intervention is necessary
- **User Engagement Driver**: The ability to vote creates interactive participation and investment in the platform

### 1.3 Votable Content Types

THE system SHALL support voting on the following content types:

- **Posts**: Text posts, link posts, and image posts within communities
- **Comments**: All comments and nested replies on posts

### 1.4 Vote Types

THE system SHALL support two vote types:

- **Upvote**: Positive endorsement indicating the content is valuable, relevant, or high-quality
- **Downvote**: Negative signal indicating the content is low-quality, irrelevant, or violates community standards

### 1.5 Voting Workflow Overview

The high-level voting interaction follows this flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["User Views Content"] --> B{"User Authenticated?"}
    B -->|"No"| C["Cannot Vote"]
    B -->|"Yes"| D["Vote Controls Available"]
    D --> E{"User Selects Vote"}
    E -->|"Upvote"| F["Register Upvote"]
    E -->|"Downvote"| G["Register Downvote"]
    E -->|"Remove Vote"| H["Register Neutral"]
    F --> I["Update Vote Score"]
    G --> I
    H --> I
    I --> J["Update Karma"]
    J --> K["Recalculate Rankings"]
    K --> L["Display Updated Score"]
```

## 2. Upvote Functionality

### 4.2 Vote Score Display Requirements

**Primary Score Display**

- THE system SHALL display the net vote score prominently near each post and comment
- THE system SHALL display scores as integers (whole numbers)
- WHEN vote score is positive, THE system MAY display it with a "+" prefix (e.g., "+42")
- WHEN vote score is zero, THE system SHALL display "0" without prefix

## 8. Anti-Manipulation Measures

### 8.1 Vote Manipulation Detection

**Suspicious Voting Patterns**

- THE system SHALL monitor for suspicious voting patterns including:
  - Rapid voting on multiple posts by the same user in a short time
  - Coordinated voting where multiple accounts vote on the same content simultaneously
  - Voting patterns that follow specific users rather than content quality
  - Vote timing that correlates suspiciously with content publication

**Automated Detection Triggers**

- WHEN a user votes on more than 50 items from the same author within 10 minutes, THE system SHALL flag this as suspicious behavior
- WHEN multiple accounts from the same IP address vote on the same content within 5 minutes, THE system SHALL flag potential vote manipulation
- WHEN voting patterns show statistically improbable correlation, THE system SHALL trigger automated review

### 8.2 Bot Voting Prevention

**CAPTCHA and Challenge Mechanisms**

- WHERE the system detects automated voting behavior, THE system SHALL challenge the user with CAPTCHA verification
- THE system MAY require CAPTCHA verification for users exhibiting bot-like voting patterns
- THE system SHALL log CAPTCHA challenges and responses for security analysis

**Automated Bot Detection**

- THE system SHALL monitor for voting behavior that indicates automated scripts or bots:
  - Perfectly regular voting intervals
  - Voting on content milliseconds after publication
  - Voting patterns that ignore content type or quality
  - Voting speed impossible for human interaction

- IF bot-like voting is detected, THEN THE system SHALL:
  - Invalidate the suspicious votes
  - Temporarily suspend voting privileges for the account
  - Flag the account for administrator review

### 8.3 Multiple Account Prevention

**IP Address Monitoring**

- THE system SHALL track IP addresses associated with voting actions
- WHEN multiple accounts from the same IP address vote on the same content, THE system SHALL investigate for vote manipulation
- THE system MAY reduce or invalidate vote weight from multiple accounts sharing the same IP address

**Device Fingerprinting**

- THE system MAY implement device fingerprinting to detect users operating multiple accounts
- WHEN the same device is used to vote from multiple accounts on the same content, THE system SHALL flag this as potential manipulation

**Account Relationship Detection**

- THE system SHALL detect accounts that consistently vote together on content
- WHEN accounts show coordinated voting patterns, THE system SHALL investigate for sockpuppet operations

### 8.4 Vote Brigade Detection

**Cross-Community Vote Brigading**

Vote brigading occurs when users from one community coordinate to manipulate votes in another community.

- THE system SHALL detect unusual voting surges on content from external referral sources
- WHEN a post receives a sudden influx of votes from users who are not subscribed to the community, THE system SHALL flag potential brigading
- THE system MAY reduce vote weight from users arriving from external links or other communities

**Brigade Mitigation Actions**

- IF vote brigading is detected, THEN THE system SHALL:
  - Alert community moderators of suspicious voting activity
  - Apply vote score adjustments to counteract artificial manipulation
  - Log the brigade source and involved accounts
  - Optionally lock voting on heavily brigaded content temporarily

### 8.5 Suspicious Voting Pattern Handling

**Automated Vote Invalidation**

- WHEN the system detects vote manipulation with high confidence, THE system SHALL automatically invalidate suspicious votes
- THE system SHALL recalculate vote scores after removing invalid votes
- THE system SHALL maintain logs of invalidated votes for audit purposes

**Account Penalties for Vote Manipulation**

- WHEN a user is confirmed to be manipulating votes, THE system SHALL:
  - Suspend the user's voting privileges temporarily (e.g., 7 days for first offense)
  - Flag the account for moderator and administrator review
  - Display a warning message to the user explaining the violation
  - For repeat offenses, permanently ban the account from voting

**Vote Manipulation Appeal Process**

- WHEN a user's votes are invalidated or privileges suspended, THE system SHALL notify the user with explanation
- THE system SHALL allow users to appeal vote manipulation penalties
- THE system SHALL provide administrators tools to review appeals and reinstate voting privileges if appropriate

### 8.6 Vote Weight Adjustments

**Trust-Based Vote Weighting**

- THE system MAY implement vote weight adjustments based on account trust factors:
  - Account age (newer accounts may have reduced vote weight)
  - Karma score (established users with high karma may have normal vote weight)
  - Voting history consistency (accounts with erratic voting patterns may be weighted lower)

**Vote Weight Calculation Factors**

The system may consider these factors for vote weighting:

| Factor | Weight Impact |
|--------|---------------|
| Account age < 7 days | Reduced weight (0.5x) |
| Account age 7-30 days | Partial weight (0.75x) |
| Account age > 30 days | Full weight (1.0x) |
| Karma score > 1000 | Full weight (1.0x) |
| Previous vote manipulation | Reduced weight or suspended |
| Suspicious voting patterns | Reduced weight (0.25x) |

**Transparent vs Hidden Weight Adjustments**

- THE system SHALL NOT publicly disclose individual vote weight calculations to prevent gaming the system
- THE system SHALL apply vote weights transparently in aggregate score calculations
- THE system SHALL maintain vote weight calculations as internal business logic

## 9. Integration Points

### 9.1 Integration with Karma System

The voting system is the primary driver of user karma scores. Detailed karma calculation rules are specified in the [Karma System Requirements](./07-karma-system.md).

**Karma Impact from Votes Received**

- WHEN a user's post receives an upvote, THE system SHALL increase the user's post karma
- WHEN a user's comment receives an upvote, THE system SHALL increase the user's comment karma
- WHEN a user's content receives a downvote, THE system SHALL decrease the corresponding karma type
- THE system SHALL calculate karma updates in near real-time as votes are cast

**Vote-to-Karma Calculation Reference**

- Vote score changes trigger karma updates according to rules defined in the Karma System document
- Karma calculations may not be 1:1 with vote counts (anti-manipulation adjustments apply)
- Karma updates are eventually consistent with vote score changes

### 9.2 Integration with Content Sorting Algorithms

Vote scores are critical inputs for content ranking and sorting. Detailed sorting algorithm specifications are defined in the [Content Sorting Algorithms Requirements](./08-content-sorting-algorithms.md).

**Vote Score as Sorting Factor**

- THE "Hot" sorting algorithm SHALL use vote score combined with time decay to rank content
- THE "Top" sorting algorithm SHALL rank content primarily by vote score within a time range
- THE "Controversial" sorting algorithm SHALL use the ratio of upvotes to downvotes to identify polarizing content
- THE "New" sorting algorithm SHALL prioritize recency but MAY use vote score as a secondary factor

**Real-Time Sorting Updates**

- WHEN vote scores change significantly, THE system SHALL update content rankings in sorted views
- THE system SHALL recalculate content positions in sorting algorithms within 5 seconds of vote score changes

### 9.3 Integration with User Profiles

User voting history and received votes are displayed on user profiles. Detailed profile specifications are defined in the [User Profiles and Feeds Requirements](./09-user-profiles-feeds.md).

**Voting History Display**

- THE system SHALL allow users to view their own voting history (upvoted and downvoted content)
- THE system SHALL display vote counts received on posts and comments in user profile views
- THE system SHALL show total karma derived from votes on the user profile

**Profile Voting Statistics**

User profiles may display:
- Total karma (derived from votes on user's content)
- Count of posts and comments created
- Top-voted posts and comments by the user

### 9.4 Integration with Moderation Tools

Vote scores and voting patterns provide signals for content moderation. Detailed moderation specifications are defined in the [Content Moderation and Reporting Requirements](./10-content-moderation-reporting.md).

**Vote-Based Moderation Signals**

- WHEN content receives an unusually high number of downvotes rapidly, THE system MAY flag it for moderator review
- THE system SHALL provide moderators visibility into vote scores when reviewing reported content
- THE system MAY automatically hide comments with very low vote scores (e.g., score below -5)

**Moderator Actions on Votes**

- THE system SHALL preserve vote scores when moderators remove content
- THE system SHALL NOT allow moderators to manipulate vote scores directly
- THE system SHALL log voting patterns associated with moderation actions for analysis

### 9.5 Integration with Post and Comment Creation

Voting controls are embedded in post and comment display. Detailed content creation specifications are defined in the [Content Creation - Posts Requirements](./04-content-creation-posts.md) and [Comment System Requirements](./06-comment-system.md).

**Vote Control Display Requirements**

- THE system SHALL display voting controls (upvote and downvote buttons) adjacent to all posts and comments
- THE system SHALL display current vote score near voting controls
- THE system SHALL update voting controls and scores in real-time as users interact

**Content Creation and Initial Votes**
