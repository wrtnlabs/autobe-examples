# Content Moderation and Reporting Requirements

## 1. Content Moderation Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

Content moderation is a critical system that maintains community standards, ensures user safety, and preserves platform integrity. This document defines the complete business requirements for how users report inappropriate content, how moderators review and act on reports, and how the platform enforces community guidelines.

The moderation system serves three primary purposes:
- **Community Safety**: Protect users from harmful, abusive, or illegal content
- **Standards Enforcement**: Maintain community-specific rules and platform-wide policies
- **Trust Building**: Create transparent and fair processes that build user confidence

### 1.2 Moderation Philosophy

The platform operates on a distributed moderation model where:
- Community moderators have primary responsibility for their communities
- Platform administrators handle appeals and system-wide violations
- Users actively participate in identifying problematic content
- Transparency and fairness guide all moderation decisions

### 1.3 Stakeholder Roles in Moderation

**Users (All Roles)**:
- Can report content they believe violates rules
- Receive notifications about moderation actions affecting their content
- Can appeal moderation decisions

**Moderators**:
- Review reports for their assigned communities
- Take moderation actions within their communities
- Cannot moderate content in communities they don't moderate
- Can ban users from their specific communities only

**Administrators**:
- Review appeals from moderator decisions
- Handle platform-wide policy violations
- Can take moderation actions in any community
- Can suspend or ban users from the entire platform
- Manage moderator conduct and accountability

**R-NOTIF-001**: THE system SHALL send notifications through the platform's internal notification system for all moderation actions.

**R-NOTIF-002**: THE system SHALL additionally send email notifications for platform suspensions and permanent bans.

**R-NOTIF-003**: THE system SHALL batch notification emails to avoid overwhelming users who have multiple pieces of content moderated simultaneously (send one email summarizing all actions rather than separate emails).

### 11.3 Scalability Considerations

**R-SCALE-001**: THE moderation queue SHALL support efficient querying and display even when containing thousands of pending reports.

**R-SCALE-002**: THE moderation logging system SHALL efficiently store and retrieve logs across millions of moderation actions.

**R-SCALE-003**: THE automated content scanning system SHALL process content submissions without introducing noticeable delay to the posting experience.

## 12. Business Rules Summary

### 12.1 Core Content Moderation Principles

1. **Distributed Authority**: Community moderators have primary control over their communities; administrators handle appeals and platform-wide issues
2. **Transparency**: Users receive clear explanations for moderation actions and have access to appeal processes
3. **Proportional Response**: Moderation actions should match the severity of violations
4. **Due Process**: Users have the right to appeal and receive fair review
5. **Prevention First**: Automated systems help prevent abuse while maintaining human oversight

### 12.2 Critical Business Constraints

1. **Report privacy must be maintained** - Reporter identities are never revealed to content creators
2. **All moderation actions must be logged** - Complete audit trail for accountability
3. **Users must be notified of actions affecting their content** - Transparency in enforcement
4. **Appeals are a user right** - Every moderation action can be appealed
5. **Moderators cannot moderate outside their scope** - Community moderators limited to their assigned communities

### 12.3 Success Metrics

The moderation system's effectiveness will be measured by:
- **Report response time**: Average time from report submission to moderator review
- **Appeal resolution rate**: Percentage of appeals processed within expected timeframes
- **False positive rate**: Percentage of automated detections that are marked as false positives
- **User satisfaction**: Feedback from users on fairness and transparency of moderation
- **Community health**: Reduction in repeat violations and improved community engagement

## 13. Future Considerations

While not part of the initial implementation requirements, the following features may be valuable in future iterations:

1. **Community Auto-Moderator Rules**: Allow moderators to configure custom automated rules for their communities
2. **Moderator Collaboration Tools**: Enable moderators to discuss difficult moderation decisions before taking action
3. **User Reputation Impact**: Consider user karma and account age in automated detection confidence scoring
4. **Machine Learning Enhancement**: Train more sophisticated models based on moderation history
5. **Moderator Performance Dashboards**: Provide detailed analytics on moderation effectiveness
6. **User-Facing Transparency Reports**: Publish aggregate moderation statistics for each community
