# Content Creation and Posts Requirements

## 1. Introduction and Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the complete business requirements for the content creation and post management system in the Reddit-like community platform. Posts are the primary content type that drives user engagement, community discussions, and platform value. Every piece of content users create—whether sharing thoughts, interesting links, or images—flows through the posting system defined in this specification.

### 1.2 Role of Posts in the Platform

Posts serve as the foundation for community engagement. They represent the initial contribution that sparks discussions, generates votes, and builds user karma. Posts are always created within the context of a specific community, making them the bridge between individual user expression and collective community interaction.

### 1.3 Supported Post Types

The platform supports three distinct post types, each serving different content sharing needs:

- **Text Posts**: Written content for discussions, questions, stories, or any text-based sharing
- **Link Posts**: Sharing external URLs to articles, videos, websites, or other web resources
- **Image Posts**: Uploading and sharing visual content directly on the platform

Each post type has unique validation requirements, display characteristics, and user interaction patterns detailed in this document.

## 2. Post Types Specification

### 2.1 Text Posts

#### 2.1.1 Text Post Definition

Text posts allow users to share written content with the community. These posts consist of a title and optional body text formatted in plain text or markdown.
