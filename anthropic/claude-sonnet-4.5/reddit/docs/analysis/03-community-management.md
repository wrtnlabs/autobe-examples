# Community Management Requirements

## 1. Community Concept and Purpose

### 1.1 What Are Communities?

Communities (analogous to subreddits in Reddit) are the foundational organizational structure of this platform. Each community serves as a dedicated space where users gather around shared interests, topics, or themes. Communities provide:

- **Content Organization**: All posts belong to a specific community, creating focused discussion spaces
- **Moderation Boundaries**: Each community has its own moderation team and rules
- **User Affiliation**: Users subscribe to communities that interest them, creating personalized content feeds
- **Identity and Culture**: Each community develops its own culture, rules, and norms

### 1.2 Business Value of Community Structure

The community-centric architecture provides several business advantages:

- **Scalable Content Organization**: As the platform grows, communities naturally segment content without requiring centralized taxonomy management
- **Distributed Moderation**: Community-specific moderators reduce the burden on platform administrators
- **User Engagement**: Subscription-based feeds increase user retention and session duration
- **Content Discovery**: Users can easily find content matching their interests by browsing and subscribing to relevant communities
- **Network Effects**: Popular communities attract more users, driving platform growth

## 2. Community Creation Requirements

### 2.1 Community Creation Authorization

**Role-Based Creation Permission**:
- THE system SHALL allow authenticated members, moderators, and administrators to create new communities
- THE system SHALL deny community creation requests from guest users
- WHEN a guest user attempts to create a community, THE system SHALL redirect them to the registration or login page with a message explaining that account creation is required

### 2.2 Community Creation Workflow

**User Journey for Creating a Community**:

1. User navigates to the "Create Community" interface
2. User fills out required community information (name, description)
3. User optionally configures additional settings (icon, banner, privacy, posting rules)
4. User submits the community creation request
5. System validates all inputs
6. System creates the community and assigns the creator as the primary moderator
7. User is redirected to the newly created community page
