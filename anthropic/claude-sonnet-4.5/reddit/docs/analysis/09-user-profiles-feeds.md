# User Profiles and Personalized Feeds

## Document Overview

This document specifies the comprehensive business requirements for user profiles and personalized content feeds in the Reddit-like community platform. User profiles serve as the public identity and activity showcase for platform members, while personalized feeds deliver relevant content based on user subscriptions and preferences. Together, these features form the foundation of user engagement and content discovery.

This specification focuses exclusively on business requirements and user needs. All technical implementation details, including database design, API specifications, and system architecture, are at the discretion of the development team.

## User Profile Overview

### Profile Purpose and Value

User profiles serve multiple critical functions within the community platform:

- **Identity Representation**: Profiles establish a recognizable identity for each user within the community, building trust and accountability
- **Contribution History**: Profiles showcase a user's posting and commenting activity, allowing others to understand their participation patterns
- **Reputation Display**: Profiles display karma scores that reflect a user's standing and contributions within the community
- **Activity Transparency**: Public profiles enable community members to review each other's participation history, promoting accountability
- **Personal Content Management**: Profiles provide users a centralized location to review and manage their own content

### Profile Accessibility

WHEN a user visits another user's profile page, THE system SHALL display the public profile information including username, karma scores, post history, and comment history.

WHEN a guest (unauthenticated visitor) attempts to view a user profile, THE system SHALL display the same public profile information available to authenticated members.

WHEN a user views their own profile, THE system SHALL display all profile information with additional options to manage their content and settings.

## Profile Information Display

### Basic Profile Information

THE system SHALL display the following core information on every user profile:

- **Username**: The unique identifier chosen during registration
- **Account Creation Date**: When the user joined the platform (displayed as "Redditor for X years/months/days")
- **Total Karma Score**: Combined post karma and comment karma
- **Post Karma**: Karma earned from post votes
- **Comment Karma**: Karma earned from comment votes

### Profile Header Section

THE system SHALL present profile information in a clearly organized header section at the top of the profile page.

WHEN displaying karma scores, THE system SHALL show both the total karma and the breakdown of post karma versus comment karma.

WHEN displaying the account age, THE system SHALL calculate the time elapsed since account creation and display it in human-readable format (e.g., "2 years, 3 months").

### Profile Avatar and Customization

THE system SHALL assign a default avatar to every user account upon creation.

WHEN a user has not uploaded a custom avatar, THE system SHALL display a platform-generated default avatar based on their username.

WHERE the platform supports custom avatars, THE system SHALL allow users to upload and display a profile picture.

### User Bio and Description

WHERE the platform includes user bio functionality, THE system SHALL allow users to add a brief text description to their profile.

IF a user has added a bio, THEN THE system SHALL display the bio text prominently on the profile page below the basic profile information.

THE system SHALL limit user bio length to prevent excessive profile text (recommended limit: 200-500 characters).

## User Post History

### Post History Display Requirements

THE system SHALL display a chronological list of all posts created by the user on their profile page.

WHEN displaying post history, THE system SHALL show posts in reverse chronological order with the most recent posts appearing first.

THE system SHALL display the following information for each post in the history:

- Post title
- Community where the post was published
- Vote score (upvotes minus downvotes)
- Number of comments received
- Time since posted (relative time format)
- Post type indicator (text, link, or image)

### Post History Organization

THE system SHALL organize post history into a scrollable list that loads additional posts as the user scrolls down (pagination or infinite scroll).

WHEN a user has created a large number of posts, THE system SHALL load posts in batches to maintain page performance (recommended: 25-50 posts per page/batch).

WHEN a user clicks on any post in the history, THE system SHALL navigate to the full post detail page showing the complete post content and all comments.

### Post Content Preview

WHEN displaying text posts in the history, THE system SHALL show a preview of the post content (first 200-300 characters) with an option to view the full post.

WHEN displaying link posts in the history, THE system SHALL show the link URL or domain name.

WHEN displaying image posts in the history, THE system SHALL show a thumbnail preview of the image.

### Deleted and Removed Posts

WHEN a user has deleted one of their own posts, THE system SHALL still show the post in their history with a "[deleted by user]" indicator.

WHEN a post has been removed by moderators, THE system SHALL show the post in the author's history with a "[removed by moderators]" indicator.

IF a post has been deleted or removed, THEN THE system SHALL not display the post content, but SHALL preserve the metadata (title, community, timestamp) for the user's reference.

### Post Filtering and Sorting

THE system SHALL allow users viewing a profile to filter posts by community.

THE system SHALL allow users viewing a profile to sort posts by:
- New (most recent first - default)
- Top (highest vote score first)
- Controversial (most contentious based on vote patterns)

WHEN a user applies a filter or sort option, THE system SHALL update the post history display immediately to reflect the selected criteria.

## User Comment History

### Comment History Display Requirements

THE system SHALL display a chronological list of all comments created by the user on their profile page, separate from the post history.

WHEN displaying comment history, THE system SHALL show comments in reverse chronological order with the most recent comments appearing first.

THE system SHALL display the following information for each comment in the history:

- Comment text content (full or preview)
- Post title where the comment was made
- Community where the comment was posted
- Vote score (upvotes minus downvotes)
- Time since posted (relative time format)
- Context link to view the comment in its full thread

### Comment Content Display

WHEN displaying comments in the history, THE system SHALL show the full comment text if it is under a certain length threshold (recommended: 500 characters).

WHEN a comment exceeds the length threshold, THE system SHALL show a preview with a "show more" option to expand the full comment text.

THE system SHALL preserve comment formatting (line breaks, basic text formatting) when displaying comments in the history.

### Comment Context Navigation

THE system SHALL provide a "context" or "view in thread" link for each comment that navigates to the original post showing the comment in its full conversation context.

WHEN a user clicks the context link, THE system SHALL navigate to the post detail page and highlight or scroll to the specific comment within the thread.

WHEN a comment is a reply to another comment (nested), THE system SHALL show a small indicator or preview of the parent comment for context.

### Deleted and Removed Comments

WHEN a user has deleted one of their own comments, THE system SHALL still show the comment in their history with a "[deleted by user]" indicator and no content.

WHEN a comment has been removed by moderators, THE system SHALL show the comment in the author's history with a "[removed by moderators]" indicator and no content.

IF a comment has been deleted or removed, THEN THE system SHALL preserve the metadata (post title, community, timestamp) for the user's reference.

### Comment Filtering and Sorting

THE system SHALL allow users viewing a profile to filter comments by community.

THE system SHALL allow users viewing a profile to sort comments by:
- New (most recent first - default)
- Top (highest vote score first)
- Controversial (most contentious based on vote patterns)

WHEN a user applies a filter or sort option to comments, THE system SHALL update the comment history display immediately to reflect the selected criteria.

## Karma Display on Profiles

### Karma Score Presentation

THE system SHALL prominently display the total karma score on every user profile, calculated as the sum of post karma and comment karma.

THE system SHALL display post karma and comment karma as separate values, allowing users to see the breakdown of reputation sources.

WHEN displaying karma scores, THE system SHALL use clear labels such as "Post Karma" and "Comment Karma" to distinguish between the two types.

### Karma Calculation Integration

THE system SHALL calculate post karma based on the net votes (upvotes minus downvotes) received on all posts created by the user.

THE system SHALL calculate comment karma based on the net votes (upvotes minus downvotes) received on all comments created by the user.

WHEN a user's post or comment receives new votes, THE system SHALL update the corresponding karma score in near real-time.

### Karma History and Transparency

THE system SHALL display karma as a cumulative total reflecting all historical voting activity on the user's content.

WHEN a post or comment is deleted, THE system SHALL retain the karma points earned from that content in the user's total karma score.

WHEN a post or comment is removed by moderators, THE system SHALL retain the karma points earned from that content unless the platform policy dictates otherwise.

### Karma Display Format

THE system SHALL format karma scores using thousand separators for readability (e.g., "1,234" or "15,678").

WHEN karma scores exceed certain thresholds, THE system MAY use abbreviated formats (e.g., "1.2k" for 1,200 or "15.6k" for 15,600) while still showing the exact number on hover or in detailed views.

## Community Subscription Management

### Subscription List Display

THE system SHALL provide a section on the user profile showing the list of communities the user has subscribed to.

WHEN viewing their own profile, THE system SHALL display the complete list of community subscriptions with options to manage them.

WHEN viewing another user's profile, THE system SHALL display the user's subscribed communities if the user has chosen to make this information public.

### Subscription Privacy Controls

THE system SHALL allow users to control whether their community subscriptions are publicly visible or private.

WHEN a user has set subscriptions to private, THE system SHALL only show the subscription list to the user themselves when viewing their own profile.

WHEN a user has set subscriptions to public, THE system SHALL display the subscription list to all visitors of the profile.

### Subscription Management Actions

WHEN a user views their own profile, THE system SHALL provide quick unsubscribe options next to each community in the subscription list.

WHEN a user clicks unsubscribe on a community from their profile, THE system SHALL remove the subscription and update the feed accordingly.

THE system SHALL allow users to navigate directly to any subscribed community by clicking on the community name in the subscription list.

### Subscription Count Display

THE system SHALL display the total number of communities the user is subscribed to on their profile.

WHEN a user has no subscriptions, THE system SHALL display a message encouraging them to discover and subscribe to communities.

## Personalized Home Feed

### Feed Purpose and Composition

The personalized home feed serves as the primary content discovery interface for authenticated users, delivering a curated stream of posts from communities they have subscribed to.

THE system SHALL create a personalized home feed for every authenticated member based on their community subscriptions.

WHEN a member has not subscribed to any communities, THE system SHALL display a default feed showing popular posts from recommended or default communities.

### Feed Content Sources

THE system SHALL include posts from all communities the user has subscribed to in the personalized home feed.

THE system SHALL aggregate posts from multiple subscribed communities into a single unified feed rather than separating them by community.

THE system SHALL display a mix of posts from different communities, avoiding dominance by any single high-activity community.

### Feed Accessibility

WHEN a member logs in and navigates to the home page, THE system SHALL display the personalized feed as the default view.

THE system SHALL make the personalized home feed easily accessible from all pages through a prominent "Home" navigation link.

WHEN a guest (unauthenticated visitor) accesses the home page, THE system SHALL display a general feed of popular or recommended content since they have no subscriptions.

### Feed Refresh and Updates

THE system SHALL allow users to refresh the feed to see new posts that have been created since they last loaded the page.

WHEN a user refreshes the feed, THE system SHALL load the most recent posts from subscribed communities while maintaining the selected sort order.

THE system SHALL periodically check for new content and optionally notify users when new posts are available (e.g., "10 new posts - click to refresh").

## Feed Composition Rules

### Post Selection Criteria

THE system SHALL include posts from subscribed communities that meet the following criteria:
- Posts are not deleted or removed
- Posts are from communities the user is currently subscribed to
- Posts match the selected time range filter (if applicable)

THE system SHALL exclude posts from communities the user has unsubscribed from, even if the posts were created while the user was subscribed.

### Feed Sorting Options

THE system SHALL support the same sorting options available on community pages: Hot, New, Top, and Controversial.

WHEN a user selects a sort option, THE system SHALL apply that sorting algorithm across all posts from all subscribed communities.

THE system SHALL default to "Hot" sorting for the personalized feed unless the user has previously selected a different sort preference.

### Hot Feed Algorithm

WHEN the feed is sorted by "Hot", THE system SHALL prioritize posts that have:
- Recent activity (recent posting time or recent vote activity)
- Positive vote momentum (rapid upvote accumulation)
- High engagement (comment activity)

THE system SHALL use time decay to ensure older posts gradually move down the feed even if they have high vote scores.

THE system SHALL calculate hot scores across all subscribed communities using consistent criteria.

### New Feed Algorithm

WHEN the feed is sorted by "New", THE system SHALL display posts in strict reverse chronological order based on post creation time.

THE system SHALL mix posts from different communities by timestamp, showing the most recently created posts first regardless of community.

### Top Feed Algorithm

WHEN the feed is sorted by "Top", THE system SHALL display posts with the highest vote scores (upvotes minus downvotes) first.

THE system SHALL support time range filters for "Top" sorting:
- Top Today (past 24 hours)
- Top This Week (past 7 days)
- Top This Month (past 30 days)
- Top This Year (past 365 days)
- Top All Time (no time restriction)

WHEN a user selects a time range, THE system SHALL only include posts created within that time period in the feed.

### Controversial Feed Algorithm

WHEN the feed is sorted by "Controversial", THE system SHALL prioritize posts that have:
- A high total number of votes (indicating engagement)
- A vote ratio close to 50/50 between upvotes and downvotes
- Significant vote activity from both perspectives

THE system SHALL support the same time range filters for "Controversial" as for "Top" sorting.

### Feed Pagination and Loading

THE system SHALL load feed content in manageable batches to ensure fast page load times (recommended: 25-50 posts per page).

WHEN a user scrolls to the bottom of the feed, THE system SHALL automatically load the next batch of posts (infinite scroll) or provide a "Load More" button.

THE system SHALL maintain the user's position in the feed when navigating away and returning, preserving their browsing context.

### Feed Diversity and Balance

THE system SHALL implement diversity algorithms to prevent any single community from dominating the feed.

WHEN multiple subscribed communities have active content, THE system SHALL distribute posts from different communities throughout the feed rather than clustering posts by community.

THE system SHALL give appropriate weight to smaller communities in the feed composition to ensure users see content from all their subscriptions.

### Removed and Moderated Content

WHEN a post in the user's feed is removed by moderators after initially appearing, THE system SHALL remove the post from the feed on next refresh.

WHEN a user is banned from a community, THE system SHALL automatically remove posts from that community from the user's feed.

## Profile Privacy Settings

### Privacy Control Overview

The platform provides users with control over the visibility of their profile information to balance transparency with privacy preferences.

### Profile Visibility Options

THE system SHALL allow users to control the visibility of their profile information through privacy settings.

THE system SHALL support the following privacy levels for user profiles:
- **Public** (default): Profile visible to all users including guests
- **Members Only**: Profile visible only to authenticated members
- **Private**: Profile visible only to the user themselves

WHEN a user sets their profile to "Members Only", THE system SHALL require authentication to view the profile and show a login prompt to guests who attempt to access it.

WHEN a user sets their profile to "Private", THE system SHALL deny access to all users except the profile owner and display an appropriate privacy message.

### Subscription List Privacy

THE system SHALL provide a separate privacy control for community subscription visibility independent of overall profile privacy.

THE system SHALL allow users to choose whether their subscription list is:
- Visible to everyone
- Visible only to authenticated members
- Hidden from everyone except themselves

WHEN a user has hidden their subscription list, THE system SHALL display a message such as "This user has chosen to keep their subscriptions private" to visitors of the profile.

### Content History Privacy

THE system SHALL allow users to choose whether their post history is publicly visible or private.

THE system SHALL allow users to choose whether their comment history is publicly visible or private.

WHEN a user has hidden their post history, THE system SHALL display a privacy message instead of the post list to other users viewing the profile.

WHEN a user has hidden their comment history, THE system SHALL display a privacy message instead of the comment list to other users viewing the profile.

### Karma Privacy

THE system SHALL allow users to hide their karma scores from public display while still tracking karma internally for platform functionality.

WHEN a user has chosen to hide karma, THE system SHALL display a message such as "Karma hidden" instead of the numerical scores on their profile.

### Privacy Setting Management

THE system SHALL provide a dedicated privacy settings page or section where users can manage all profile privacy controls.

WHEN a user changes privacy settings, THE system SHALL apply the changes immediately and update the public profile view accordingly.

THE system SHALL clearly explain the implications of each privacy setting to help users make informed decisions about their profile visibility.

### Default Privacy Settings

THE system SHALL set reasonable default privacy settings for new accounts that balance community transparency with user privacy.

THE system SHALL default to public profiles to encourage community engagement and accountability.

THE system SHALL inform users during registration about profile privacy options and allow them to adjust settings during account setup.

## Profile Navigation and User Experience

### Profile Access Points

THE system SHALL provide multiple ways for users to access profiles:
- Clicking on a username anywhere it appears (posts, comments, etc.)
- Direct URL navigation using the username
- Profile link in the user's account menu

WHEN a user clicks on any username displayed in the platform, THE system SHALL navigate to that user's profile page.

### Profile URL Structure

THE system SHALL use a consistent, user-friendly URL structure for profiles, such as `/user/[username]` or `/u/[username]`.

THE system SHALL ensure profile URLs are bookmarkable and shareable.

### Profile Performance Requirements

WHEN loading a user profile page, THE system SHALL display the basic profile information and karma scores immediately (within 1-2 seconds).

THE system SHALL load post and comment history incrementally to avoid long initial load times for users with extensive history.

WHEN a profile has thousands of posts or comments, THE system SHALL use efficient pagination or lazy loading to maintain responsive performance.

### Mobile Profile Experience

THE system SHALL provide a mobile-responsive profile layout that adapts to smaller screens.

WHEN users access profiles from mobile devices, THE system SHALL prioritize the most important information (username, karma, recent activity) in the initial viewport.

THE system SHALL ensure all profile navigation and sorting controls are easily accessible on touch devices.

## Integration with Other System Components

### Authentication Integration

THE system SHALL only allow authenticated members to view personalized feeds based on their subscriptions.

THE system SHALL redirect unauthenticated guests attempting to access personalized feeds to a login page or general feed.

### Community Subscription Integration

WHEN a user subscribes to a new community, THE system SHALL immediately include posts from that community in the user's personalized feed.

WHEN a user unsubscribes from a community, THE system SHALL immediately remove posts from that community from the user's personalized feed.

THE system SHALL synchronize subscription changes across all user sessions and devices in near real-time.

### Karma System Integration

THE system SHALL continuously update profile karma displays as votes are cast on the user's posts and comments throughout the platform.

THE system SHALL ensure karma calculations on profiles match the karma calculation rules defined in the karma system specification.

### Content Moderation Integration

WHEN content is removed from a user's history due to moderation actions, THE system SHALL update the profile display to reflect the removal.

WHEN a user is banned from the platform, THE system SHALL apply appropriate restrictions to their profile visibility based on platform policy.

## Success Criteria and User Experience Goals

### User Engagement Metrics

The profile and feed system should achieve the following user experience outcomes:

- **Profile Engagement**: Users regularly visit profiles to understand comment context and user history
- **Feed Utilization**: The personalized feed becomes the primary content discovery method for subscribed users
- **Subscription Growth**: Users actively subscribe to multiple communities to customize their feed
- **Return Visits**: Personalized feeds encourage daily return visits to see new content from favorite communities

### Performance Expectations

THE system SHALL load profile pages and feeds quickly enough that users experience them as instant or near-instant (target: under 2 seconds for initial load).

THE system SHALL handle profiles with extensive post and comment history (10,000+ items) without performance degradation.

### User Satisfaction Goals

The profile and feed features should provide:
- Clear visibility into user participation and reputation
- Efficient content discovery through personalized feeds
- Flexible privacy controls that respect user preferences
- Intuitive navigation and sorting across all content views
