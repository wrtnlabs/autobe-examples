  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated list of replies to a specific
   * comment.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of comment replies nested under a
   * specific parent comment. This operation provides advanced search
   * capabilities for finding replies based on multiple criteria including
   * partial text matching, vote score filtering, author identification, and
   * creation date ranges.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive pagination with configurable page
   * sizes and sorting options. Users can sort replies by creation date
   * (chronological or reverse), vote score (top-voted first or controversial),
   * or using the specialized comment sorting algorithms (best, top, new,
   * controversial) as defined in the comment system requirements. This
   * flexibility enables different browsing patterns from discovering newest
   * replies to finding most popular or most controversial responses.
   *
   * Security considerations include rate limiting for search operations to
   * prevent abuse, appropriate filtering based on the requesting user's
   * authorization level and community ban status, and proper handling of
   * deleted or removed comments. Guest users can view replies in public
   * communities, while members, moderators, and administrators have full access
   * based on their respective permission levels. The operation respects
   * soft-deleted comments by hiding content while preserving thread structure
   * as specified in the comment system requirements section 5.7.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the reddit_like_comments table as defined in
   * the Prisma schema, incorporating all available comment fields including
   * content_text, vote_score, depth, edited status, and hierarchical
   * relationships. The response includes reply information optimized for
   * threaded discussion displays, with options to include additional metadata
   * such as author karma, vote counts, and edit timestamps based on the
   * requesting user's needs and authorization level.
   *
   * The operation enforces the maximum comment nesting depth of 10 levels as
   * specified in the comment threading requirements. When the parent comment is
   * at or near maximum depth, the operation may return fewer or no replies
   * based on the depth limitation rules defined in section 4.1 of the Comment
   * System Requirements.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param commentId Unique identifier of the parent comment whose replies are
   *   being retrieved
   * @param body Search criteria, filtering options, and pagination parameters
   *   for retrieving comment replies
