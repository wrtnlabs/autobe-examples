  /**
   * Terminate guest user session and clear session tracking data.
   *
   * This operation performs logout for guest users (unauthenticated visitors)
   * by terminating their current session and clearing associated tracking data.
   * Guest sessions are tracked in the reddit_like_users table with role='guest'
   * and a unique session_identifier used for analytics and conversion
   * tracking.
   *
   * When a guest user initiates logout, the system clears the
   * session_identifier, ip_address, user_agent, and related tracking fields
   * from the guest user record. This effectively ends the anonymous session and
   * removes any personalization or tracking associated with that guest
   * session.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring the session termination is
   * complete and that any client-side session data is properly cleared. The
   * operation is available to all users regardless of authentication status, as
   * guests may have active sessions that need to be terminated.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the authentication system defined in the
   * User Roles and Authentication requirements. It provides a clean exit path
   * for guest users who wish to clear their browsing data or start a fresh
   * session. After logout, the guest user can continue browsing as a new guest
   * session or proceed to register for a member account.
   *
   * The operation does not require request body parameters as the guest session
   * is identified through session tokens or cookies provided by the client. The
   * system identifies the guest user context from the authentication state and
   * terminates the appropriate session.
