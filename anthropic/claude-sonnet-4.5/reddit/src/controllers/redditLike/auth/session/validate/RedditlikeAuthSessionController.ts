  /**
   * Validate JWT access token and verify active session status.
   *
   * This operation validates an existing JWT access token to determine whether
   * the user's session remains valid and active. When a client application
   * needs to verify that the current user is still authenticated, this endpoint
   * checks the provided access token against the reddit_like_sessions table in
   * the database.
   *
   * The validation process performs several critical checks. First, it verifies
   * that the access token exists in the database and corresponds to an active
   * session record. Second, it checks that the access_token_expires_at
   * timestamp has not passed, ensuring the token is still within its 30-minute
   * validity window as defined in the authentication requirements. Third, it
   * verifies that the session has not been explicitly revoked through soft
   * deletion (deleted_at is null), which occurs when users log out or change
   * their passwords.
   *
   * Security considerations include protecting against token reuse after
   * logout, preventing access with expired credentials, and ensuring session
   * integrity. The operation validates that the associated user account exists
   * and is in good standing, checking that the reddit_like_users record is not
   * soft-deleted and that the user is not under platform suspension.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the User Roles and Authentication system
   * defined in the requirements, implementing the JWT-based session management
   * specified in sections on login and session management. It provides the
   * foundation for maintaining authenticated state across API requests and
   * supports the token refresh workflow when access tokens expire.
   *
   * Related API operations include the initial login endpoint that creates
   * sessions and generates tokens, the token refresh endpoint that issues new
   * access tokens using refresh tokens, and the logout endpoint that explicitly
   * revokes sessions. This validation endpoint is typically called by client
   * applications on startup, page refresh, or before performing authenticated
   * actions to ensure the user's session remains valid.
   *
   * Expected behavior includes returning current user information (user ID,
   * username, role) when the token is valid, returning authentication errors
   * when the token is expired or invalid, and properly handling edge cases such
   * as deleted user accounts or revoked sessions.
