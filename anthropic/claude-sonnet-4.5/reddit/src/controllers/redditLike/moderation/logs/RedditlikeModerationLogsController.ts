  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered moderation log entries with pagination and
   * advanced filtering.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of moderation log entries from the
   * comprehensive audit trail system. This operation provides access to the
   * reddit_like_moderation_logs table, which records all moderation system
   * activities including report submissions, moderation actions, ban issuances,
   * appeal submissions, and appeal decisions.
   *
   * The moderation logs serve as a permanent, immutable audit trail for
   * accountability, transparency, and legal compliance per requirements
   * R-LOG-001 through R-LOG-005. Each log entry captures complete context
   * including the actor who performed the action (member, moderator, or admin),
   * the related moderation entities (reports, actions, bans, suspensions,
   * appeals), the community context, event type, human-readable action
   * description, and precise timestamp with second precision.
   *
   * This operation supports comprehensive filtering and search capabilities to
   * help moderators and administrators efficiently find relevant log entries.
   * Filters include log type (report_submitted, action_taken, ban_issued,
   * etc.), actor role (member, moderator, admin), community context, time
   * ranges, and full-text search within action descriptions and metadata. The
   * search functionality uses the GIN trigram index on action_description for
   * efficient text matching.
   *
   * Access control is role-based: moderators can view logs only for communities
   * they moderate per requirement R-LOG-008, while administrators have access
   * to complete platform-wide moderation history per requirement R-LOG-009. The
   * system filters results based on the authenticated user's role and community
   * moderation assignments, ensuring proper data access boundaries.
   *
   * The operation returns paginated results with sorting options by timestamp
   * (newest first by default per R-LOG-010), log type, or community. Each log
   * entry includes comprehensive details about the moderation event, references
   * to related entities (with IDs for further lookup), and metadata context.
   * The pagination structure supports efficient browsing of large log datasets
   * while maintaining query performance through proper indexing on log_type,
   * created_at, actor IDs, and community_id.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the broader moderation system, providing
   * transparency into moderation decisions and enabling pattern analysis for
   * improving moderation effectiveness. The logs support moderator
   * accountability, user transparency (through public moderation logs per
   * R-LOG-015 through R-LOG-018), and administrative oversight of moderation
   * practices across the platform.
