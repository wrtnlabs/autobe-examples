  /**
   * Retrieve paginated and sorted list of comments for a specific post.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive list of comments associated with a specific post,
   * with support for multiple sorting algorithms and pagination. This operation
   * implements the comment display system defined in the Comment System
   * Requirements, enabling users to view threaded discussions on posts.
   *
   * The operation supports five distinct sorting methods as specified in
   * requirements: Best (confidence-based scoring balancing vote score and
   * controversy), Top (highest net vote score), New (newest first
   * chronologically), Controversial (similar upvote/downvote ratios with high
   * volume), and Old (oldest first chronologically). Each sorting method serves
   * different user needs, from discovering quality discussions to following
   * conversation chronology.
   *
   * This endpoint integrates with the reddit_like_comments table which stores
   * the complete comment tree structure with parent-child relationships
   * supporting nesting up to 10 levels deep. Comments are filtered based on the
   * provided postId, ensuring only comments belonging to the specified post are
   * returned. The response includes vote scores calculated from the
   * reddit_like_comment_votes table, enabling accurate display of community
   * assessment.
   *
   * Pagination is implemented to handle posts with hundreds or thousands of
   * comments efficiently. The request supports configurable page size with a
   * default of 50 comments per page, matching the performance requirements
   * specified in Comment System Requirements section 10.1. The operation loads
   * comments in batches to maintain fast response times (target: under 2
   * seconds for initial load).
   *
   * The operation is accessible to all user roles including guests
   * (unauthenticated visitors), members, moderators, and administrators. Public
   * posts display their comment threads to all users, promoting open discussion
   * and content discovery. Authentication is not required for reading comments,
   * only for creating comments or voting on them.
   *
   * Security considerations include validation of the postId parameter to
   * ensure it references an existing post, handling of deleted or removed
   * comments (displaying placeholder text while preserving thread structure),
   * and appropriate filtering of comments based on moderation status. The
   * response includes edit indicators for modified comments and properly
   * handles the soft-delete pattern where deleted comments show [deleted] while
   * maintaining their position in the conversation tree.
   *
   * This operation is frequently used in conjunction with the post detail
   * retrieval endpoint (GET /posts/{postId}) to provide the complete post
   * viewing experience. When users navigate to a post, they typically view the
   * post content first, then load the comment discussion using this endpoint
   * with their preferred sorting method.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier of the post whose comments are being
   *   retrieved
   * @param body Search criteria, sorting preferences, and pagination parameters
   *   for filtering and organizing comments
