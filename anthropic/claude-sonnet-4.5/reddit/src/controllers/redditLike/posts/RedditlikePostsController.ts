  /**
   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of posts.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of posts from the Reddit-like
   * community platform with comprehensive search, filtering, sorting, and
   * pagination capabilities. This operation provides the primary content
   * discovery mechanism for users browsing posts across multiple communities or
   * within specific communities, supporting all four core sorting algorithms
   * defined in the platform requirements.
   *
   * The operation queries the reddit_like_posts table as the primary data
   * source, joining with type-specific content tables
   * (reddit_like_post_text_content, reddit_like_post_link_content,
   * reddit_like_post_image_content) to include type-discriminated content
   * details. For performance optimization, the operation leverages the
   * mv_reddit_like_post_metrics materialized view to retrieve pre-calculated
   * vote_score and comment_count without expensive real-time aggregation from
   * reddit_like_post_votes and reddit_like_comments tables. The operation joins
   * with reddit_like_communities to include community metadata and with
   * reddit_like_members to include post author information including username
   * and karma scores.
   *
   * Filtering capabilities include community_id filtering to restrict results
   * to specific communities, post type filtering (text, link, image) via the
   * type discriminator field, date range filtering on created_at timestamps to
   * find posts within specific time periods, vote score range filtering using
   * the materialized view metrics, and full-text search on post titles using
   * the PostgreSQL trigram index for fuzzy matching. The operation supports
   * excluding soft-deleted posts by filtering where deleted_at is null, and
   * optionally filtering posts from communities where the authenticated user is
   * banned by checking reddit_like_community_bans.
   *
   * Sorting algorithm support implements the four core content discovery
   * methods specified in requirements document
   * 08-content-sorting-algorithms.md. The 'hot' sorting calculates trending
   * scores based on vote velocity, post age, and engagement momentum with time
   * decay factors, surfacing content gaining traction in the last 24 hours. The
   * 'new' sorting orders posts by created_at timestamp in strict reverse
   * chronological order, giving every post equal initial visibility. The 'top'
   * sorting ranks posts by net vote score from mv_reddit_like_post_metrics with
   * support for time range filters (hour, day, week, month, year, all-time),
   * enabling discovery of highest-quality content within specific periods. The
   * 'controversial' sorting identifies polarizing content by calculating
   * controversy scores based on vote balance (posts near 50/50 upvote/downvote
   * ratio) and total vote volume, requiring minimum engagement thresholds to
   * surface genuinely divisive discussions.
   *
   * Pagination support includes configurable page size with recommended default
   * of 25-50 posts per page, offset-based or cursor-based pagination for
   * consistent browsing, and total count of matching posts for pagination
   * controls. The operation maintains query performance through strategic
   * indexing on reddit_like_posts(reddit_like_community_id, created_at),
   * reddit_like_posts(type, created_at), and the title trigram index for search
   * queries. Response time targets maintain under 2 seconds for initial page
   * load under normal load conditions per performance requirements.
   *
   * Security considerations include public access allowing guests to view posts
   * from public communities without authentication, optional authentication to
   * personalize results based on user subscriptions and preferences, and
   * automatic filtering of posts from private communities
   * (reddit_like_communities.privacy_type='private') unless the authenticated
   * user is an approved member. The operation respects community privacy
   * settings and ban status, excluding content the requesting user should not
   * access.
   *
   * Related operations include POST /posts for creating new posts, GET
   * /posts/{postId} for retrieving individual post details with full content
   * and comment threads, PUT /posts/{postId} for editing post content, DELETE
   * /posts/{postId} for removing posts, and GET
   * /communities/{communityId}/posts for community-specific post listing. The
   * search operation integrates with the voting system
   * (reddit_like_post_votes), karma system (reddit_like_user_karma), and
   * community subscription system (reddit_like_community_subscriptions) to
   * provide comprehensive post discovery and content curation.

  /**
   * Retrieve a paginated list of posts sorted by hot algorithm showing

   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of posts sorted by the hot
   * algorithm, which surfaces currently trending and popular content based on
   * vote momentum and recency. This operation implements the Hot Algorithm
   * requirements from the Content Sorting Algorithms specification, calculating
   * hot scores that balance net vote scores with time decay to ensure fresh,
   * engaging content appears prominently.
   *
   * The hot algorithm prioritizes posts that are gaining traction right now
   * rather than simply displaying the most-voted content of all time. Posts
   * created within the last 6-12 hours have an advantage over older posts with
   * similar vote counts. Early engagement is rewarded, with posts gaining 10+
   * votes in the first hour ranking higher than posts with the same votes
   * accumulated over 6 hours. The hot score decreases exponentially with post
   * age, ensuring the feed remains dynamic and constantly changing.
   *
   * This operation queries the reddit_like_posts table joined with
   * mv_reddit_like_post_metrics for pre-calculated vote scores and comment
   * counts, applying the hot score calculation formula that considers vote
   * velocity, time decay, and engagement patterns. Posts with negative net
   * votes are suppressed with very low hot scores, while posts receiving rapid
   * upvotes receive velocity bonuses that boost their hot scores above linear
   * expectations.
   *
   * The request body supports comprehensive filtering options including
   * community restrictions (filter by specific community IDs or retrieve from
   * all communities), time range filters (limit to posts created within
   * specified time windows), pagination controls (page number and page size),
   * and search keywords (filter posts by title or content matching). When no
   * community filter is provided, the operation returns hot posts from all
   * public communities, creating a platform-wide trending feed.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring guests and authenticated users can
   * both access this public content discovery endpoint. The operation respects
   * community privacy settings, excluding posts from private communities unless
   * the requesting user is an approved member. Deleted or moderator-removed
   * posts are excluded from results automatically.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the voting system to use current vote scores,
   * the content creation system to respect post metadata, and the community
   * system to enforce privacy rules. Hot scores are recalculated periodically
   * (recommended every 5-15 minutes) to ensure feed freshness, with the
   * materialized view providing performant access to pre-calculated metrics
   * without impacting vote write performance.
