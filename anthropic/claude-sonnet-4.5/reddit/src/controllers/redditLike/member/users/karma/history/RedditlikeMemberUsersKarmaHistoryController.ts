  /**
   * Search and retrieve paginated karma change history for a specific user from
   * reddit_like_karma_history table.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of karma change events for a
   * specified user from the reddit_like_karma_history table. This operation
   * provides complete transparency into how a user's reputation has evolved
   * over time by showing individual karma modifications triggered by voting
   * activity on their posts and comments.
   *
   * Each karma history record represents a single karma change event, capturing
   * the karma type affected (post or comment), the amount of change (positive
   * or negative), the vote action that triggered the change (upvote added,
   * downvote added, vote removed, vote changed), and references to the specific
   * post or comment that was voted on. This audit trail enables users to
   * understand exactly how their karma scores were calculated and helps
   * troubleshoot any discrepancies.
   *
   * The endpoint supports comprehensive filtering and searching capabilities
   * including filtering by karma type (post karma vs comment karma changes),
   * date range filtering to view karma changes within specific time periods,
   * change amount filtering to find significant karma events, and vote action
   * filtering to understand what types of voting behavior affected the user's
   * karma. Pagination is essential given that active users may have thousands
   * of karma change events over their account lifetime.
   *
   * Business requirements specify that karma history records must be retained
   * for a minimum of 12 months, though the system may retain records
   * indefinitely for audit purposes. The history provides insights into karma
   * earning patterns, helps users identify which content earned the most karma,
   * and supports the broader transparency goals of the karma system.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring users can only view karma history
   * for their own accounts unless they are administrators who may need access
   * for support purposes. The karma history represents a complete audit trail
   * of reputation changes and should be treated as sensitive user data
   * requiring appropriate access controls with ownership verification to ensure
   * the authenticated member's ID matches the userId path parameter.
   *
   * This operation is typically used in user profile interfaces where users
   * review their karma progression, analytics dashboards showing karma trends,
   * and support tools for investigating karma calculation issues. The returned
   * data includes all relevant metadata from the reddit_like_karma_history
   * table including timestamps, karma types, change amounts, triggering vote
   * actions, and references to the affected content.
   *
   * Related operations that users might access in conjunction with this
   * endpoint include retrieving current karma totals (GET
   * /users/{userId}/karma), viewing user post history to see which posts earned
   * karma, and accessing user comment history to understand comment karma
   * sources. The karma history provides the detailed breakdown that complements
   * the high-level karma totals.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Unique identifier of the user whose karma change history is
   *   being retrieved
   * @param body Search criteria and pagination parameters for filtering karma
   *   history events by karma type, date range, change amount, and vote action
