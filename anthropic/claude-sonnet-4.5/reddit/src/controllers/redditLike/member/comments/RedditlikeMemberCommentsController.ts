   * Create a new comment or reply in a post discussion thread.
   *
   * Create a new comment on a post or reply to an existing comment, enabling
   * community discussion and engagement through threaded conversations. This
   * operation inserts a new record into the reddit_like_comments table and
   * supports the complete nested comment threading system defined in the
   * business requirements.
   *
   * This operation requires user authentication and validates that the
   * authenticated member is not banned from the community where the content
   * exists. The comment content must be between 1 and 10,000 characters and is
   * stored with markdown formatting support. When creating a reply to another
   * comment, the system validates the parent comment exists and enforces the
   * maximum nesting depth of 10 levels per business requirement section 4.4.
   *
   * The newly created comment is initialized with zero vote score, depth level
   * calculated from parent comment (0 for top-level comments), and edited flag
   * set to false. The system automatically increments the post's comment count
   * through the mv_reddit_like_post_metrics materialized view and makes the
   * comment immediately available for voting and further replies.
   *
   * Security considerations include content sanitization to prevent XSS
   * attacks, rate limiting to prevent spam (max 10 comments per minute per
   * business requirement section 11.2), and duplicate comment detection
   * (rejecting identical comments within 5 minutes per requirement section
   * 11.2). URL validation ensures only HTTP/HTTPS protocols are allowed in
   * comment text links, protecting users from malicious links.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the voting system by enabling immediate vote
   * capability on the new comment, the karma system by preparing the comment
   * for potential karma earning, and the content moderation system by making
   * the comment reportable if it violates rules. The comment appears in the
   * author's comment history on their profile and contributes to the overall
   * discussion thread structure.

   * Update comment content by the comment author within 24-hour edit window.
   *
   * This operation enables authenticated members to modify the text content of
   * their own comments within 24 hours of creation, as specified in the comment
   * system requirements document section 5.1. The endpoint validates comment
   * ownership, ensuring only the original author can edit their content, and
   * enforces the time-based editing window to maintain discussion integrity.
   *
   * The operation interacts with the reddit_like_comments table in the Prisma
   * schema, updating the content_text field while preserving all other comment
   * attributes including vote scores, nesting relationships, and creation
   * timestamps. When an edit is successfully applied, the system sets the
   * 'edited' boolean flag to true and updates the updated_at timestamp to
   * reflect the modification time.
   *
   * Security considerations include verifying the authenticated user matches
   * the comment's reddit_like_member_id foreign key, preventing unauthorized
   * edits of other users' comments. The system also validates that deleted_at
   * is null, preventing edits to comments that have been soft-deleted by the
   * author or removed by moderators.
   *
   * Validation rules require the edited comment text to comply with the same
   * constraints as new comments: minimum 1 character, maximum 10,000
   * characters, no empty or whitespace-only content. The system rejects edits
   * that would result in empty comments or exceed length limits, maintaining
   * content quality standards.
   *
   * The edited comment maintains its position in the thread hierarchy,
   * preserving the parent-child relationship defined by
   * reddit_like_parent_comment_id and depth fields. Vote scores accumulated
   * before the edit remain intact, ensuring karma calculations reflect
   * community assessment of the original content while allowing authors to
   * clarify or improve their contributions.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the comment display system to show an
   * 'edited X time ago' indicator next to modified comments, providing
   * transparency to readers that the content has been changed from its original
   * form. The edit timestamp displayed to users is calculated from the
   * updated_at field.

  /**
   * Remove comment by the comment author with soft deletion.
   *
   * This operation enables authenticated members to remove their own comments
   * from public view through a soft deletion mechanism, as specified in the
   * comment system requirements document section 5.4. The endpoint validates
   * comment ownership, ensuring only the original author can initiate deletion
   * of their content, preventing unauthorized removal of other users'
   * comments.
   *
   * The operation performs a soft delete on the reddit_like_comments table by
   * setting the deleted_at timestamp field to the current time while preserving
   * all other comment data in the database. This soft deletion approach is
   * necessary to maintain thread structure and conversation continuity,
   * particularly when the deleted comment has child replies nested beneath it
   * in the comment tree.
   *
   * Security considerations include verifying the authenticated user's ID
   * matches the comment's reddit_like_member_id foreign key reference,
   * implementing role-based access control to ensure only the comment author
   * can delete their content. The system prevents deletion attempts on comments
   * that are already soft-deleted (deleted_at is not null) to avoid redundant
   * operations.
   *
   * According to the comment system requirements section 5.7, when a parent
   * comment is deleted, all child replies remain visible and properly threaded.
   * The soft-deleted parent comment displays as '[deleted]' with the author
   * username removed, but the comment's position in the hierarchy is preserved
   * through the reddit_like_parent_comment_id relationship. This ensures nested
   * conversations remain coherent even when intermediate comments are removed.
   *
   * The comment's vote score and accumulated karma remain intact after deletion
   * per the karma system requirements section 4.4, which explicitly states that
   * content deletion does not reverse earned or lost karma. This prevents users
   * from manipulating their reputation by deleting poorly-received comments.
   *
   * When a comment with no child replies is deleted, the system may choose to
   * completely hide it from the UI, but the database record persists with the
   * deleted_at timestamp for audit trail purposes and to support potential
   * future recovery mechanisms. The deletion is immediate, taking effect within
   * 1 second, and the user receives confirmation of the successful deletion.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the comment display system to render deleted
   * comments appropriately: showing '[deleted]' text for author-deleted
   * comments versus '[removed by moderator]' for moderator removals, allowing
   * users to distinguish between self-deletions and moderation actions.

   * timestamp, making the comment visible again in discussion threads. This
   * operation is essential for recovering comments that were deleted by mistake
   * or removed during moderation but later approved through appeals.
   *
   * When a comment is deleted in the platform, it undergoes soft deletion where
   * the deleted_at timestamp is set but the comment data remains in the
   * reddit_like_comments table. Soft deletion preserves the comment's position
   * in the thread hierarchy, all voting data, karma attribution, and nested
   * reply relationships while hiding the comment content from public view. The
   * thread structure remains intact with '[deleted]' placeholder shown to
   * maintain conversation context.
   *
   * This restoration endpoint reverses the soft deletion by clearing the
   * deleted_at field, immediately making the comment content visible again in
   * its original thread position. The comment appears exactly where it was
   * before deletion, maintaining all parent-child relationships in the nested
   * comment tree. All previously earned karma from the comment remains intact
   * per business requirements, and the comment's vote score is preserved.
   *
   * Authorization for comment restoration depends on the context: comment
   * authors can restore their own deleted comments within reasonable
   * timeframes, community moderators can restore comments removed as part of
   * moderation actions in their communities, and platform administrators can
   * restore any comment platform-wide. The operation validates that the

   * text, creation timestamp, vote score, depth level, and threading
   * relationships. Child replies that were preserved during deletion remain
   * connected to the restored parent comment. The comment immediately becomes

   * naturally into the existing conversation thread based on its original
   * creation time, not the restoration time.
