  /**
   * Create a new post in a community.
   *
   * Create a new post within a specified community on the Reddit-like platform.
   * This operation enables authenticated members to share content with
   * communities through three distinct post types: text posts for written
   * discussions and questions, link posts for sharing external web content, and
   * image posts for uploading and sharing visual media.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the reddit_like_posts table as the main post
   * entity, along with type-specific content tables based on the post type
   * discriminator. When creating a text post, the system stores the body
   * content in reddit_like_post_text_content with support for markdown
   * formatting up to 40,000 characters. For link posts, the system validates
   * the URL, stores it in reddit_like_post_link_content, and attempts to
   * extract Open Graph metadata including preview title, description, and
   * thumbnail image. Image posts require file upload with validation of format
   * (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP), size (maximum 20MB), and automatic generation of
   * multiple image versions (original, medium 640px, thumbnail 150x150) stored
   * in reddit_like_post_image_content.
   *
   * Security considerations include verifying the user is authenticated as a
   * member, moderator, or administrator per the reddit_like_users role field.
   * The system must validate the user is not banned from the target community
   * by checking reddit_like_community_bans for active bans where
   * banned_member_id matches the authenticated user and community_id matches
   * the target community. Community-specific posting permissions from
   * reddit_like_communities.posting_permission must be enforced, restricting
   * posting based on subscription status or moderator approval. Content
   * validation prevents XSS attacks through sanitization, validates URLs
   * against malicious site databases, and enforces anti-spam rate limiting
   * (maximum 10 posts per hour, 5 posts per day for accounts less than 24 hours
   * old).
   *
   * The operation initializes new posts with vote_score of 0, created_at
   * timestamp, and associates the post with the authenticated user's ID
   * (reddit_like_member_id) and selected community ID
   * (reddit_like_community_id). All post titles must be 3-300 characters with
   * leading/trailing whitespace trimmed. The type-specific content undergoes
   * additional validation: text body limited to 40,000 characters with markdown
   * support, URLs validated for HTTP/HTTPS protocol and maximum 2,000
   * characters, and images validated for format, size, dimensions, and
   * integrity.
   *
   * Related API operations include PATCH /posts for searching and retrieving
   * posts with filtering, GET /posts/{postId} for viewing individual post
   * details, PUT /posts/{postId} for editing post content within allowed time
   * windows, and DELETE /posts/{postId} for soft-deleting posts. Community
   * subscription status affects posting permissions and is validated through
   * reddit_like_community_subscriptions. The created post immediately becomes
   * available for voting through the reddit_like_post_votes table and
   * commenting through the reddit_like_comments table, contributing to the
   * author's post karma tracked in reddit_like_user_karma.

  /**
   * Update editable content fields of an existing post by its author.
   *
   * Update the editable content of a post identified by postId. This operation
   * allows post authors to modify specific fields of their posts according to
   * business rules defined in the Content Creation requirements section 6 (Post
   * Editing Capabilities).
   *
   * The editing permissions and field mutability follow strict business rules:
   * post authors can edit their own posts only, with no editing rights for
   * other users including moderators and administrators (moderators can only
   * remove posts, not edit them). The title field can be edited only within 5
   * minutes of the post's creation timestamp; after this grace period, titles
   * become immutable to maintain URL and reference stability. For text posts,
   * the body content from reddit_like_post_text_content can be edited at any
   * time without restrictions. For image posts, the caption field from
   * reddit_like_post_image_content can be edited at any time. Link posts have
   * the most restrictive editing rules: the URL field in
   * reddit_like_post_link_content is completely immutable after creation,
   * preventing link substitution attacks.
   *
   * When an edit is successfully processed, the operation updates the
   * updated_at timestamp to the current time, records the edit event, and may
   * set an edited flag or indicator that displays to users viewing the post.
   * The edit history tracking requirements specify that edits within the first
   * 3 minutes are considered a grace period and may not display edit
   * indicators, while edits after this window clearly show 'edited' status with
   * timestamp.
   *
   * Security and validation considerations include verifying the authenticated
   * user is the post author by comparing the JWT token user ID with the post's
   * reddit_like_member_id field, validating edited content against the same
   * rules as post creation (title length 3-300 characters, body length up to
   * 40,000 characters, caption up to 10,000 characters), sanitizing all user
   * input to prevent XSS attacks, and preserving markdown formatting in text
   * content. The operation performs time-based validation by checking the
   * difference between current time and created_at to enforce the 5-minute
   * title editing window.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the karma system by preserving all vote
   * scores when content is edited, ensuring edits do not reset engagement
   * metrics. Comments on the post remain associated and visible regardless of
   * post edits. The edit does not affect the post's community association, type
   * discriminator, or author attribution, which are all immutable fields.
   *
   * This operation supports the user experience requirement that allows content
   * creators to fix typos, clarify information, or improve their contributions
   * while maintaining content integrity through immutable core fields and
   * transparent edit tracking.

  /**
   * Remove a post by ID from the reddit_like_posts table.
   *
   * Remove a specific post identified by its unique post ID. When a post is
   * deleted, the post is removed from public view while preserving the database
   * record for audit purposes and referential integrity. The content becomes
   * hidden from users but the record remains in the database with all metadata
   * intact.
   *
   * This operation is available to three user roles with different
   * authorization contexts: the post author (member who created the post) can
   * delete their own content at any time as part of content ownership rights,
   * community moderators can remove posts within the communities they moderate
   * as part of their content moderation responsibilities, and platform
   * administrators can delete any post across all communities for platform-wide
   * policy enforcement.
   *
   * When a post is removed, the content is hidden from public view and removed
   * from community feeds, search results, and sorting algorithms. The system
   * displays a placeholder message such as 'This post has been deleted by the
   * author' or 'This post has been removed by moderators' depending on who
   * initiated the deletion. However, the post record remains in the database
   * with all metadata intact including the post ID, title, community
   * association, author information, and timestamps.
   *
   * Associated comments remain accessible and visible to maintain thread
   * integrity and preserve valuable discussions. The comment section displays
   * with a notice indicating the parent post has been removed, but all comment
   * content, voting, and threading functionality continues to work normally.
   * This design ensures that community discussions are not lost when posts are
   * deleted, maintaining the value of user contributions in comment threads.
   *
   * Vote scores and karma points previously earned from the deleted post are
   * preserved according to the karma system requirements defined in document
   * 07-karma-system.md section 4.4. This prevents users from manipulating their
   * reputation by creating content to gain karma and then deleting
   * poorly-received posts to avoid karma loss. The karma earned from a post
   * persists even after deletion, maintaining the integrity of the reputation
   * system.
   *
   * The deletion workflow requires the authenticated user making the request to
   * have appropriate authorization based on their role and relationship to the
   * content. Post authors can delete their own posts through the member
   * authorization role. Moderators must have moderator status for the specific
   * community where the post exists, verified through the
   * reddit_like_community_moderators table. Administrators have unrestricted
   * deletion capabilities across all communities. The operation validates these
   * permissions before proceeding with the deletion operation.
   *
   * Related operations include POST /communities/{communityId}/posts for
   * creating posts that may later be deleted, GET /posts/{postId} for
   * retrieving post details before making deletion decisions, PUT
   * /posts/{postId} for editing posts as an alternative to deletion, and
   * various moderation endpoints defined in the Content Moderation and
   * Reporting requirements for moderator-initiated content removal as part of

  /**
   * Restore a soft-deleted post to make it visible again.
   *
   * Restores a previously soft-deleted post by clearing its deleted_at
   * timestamp, making the post visible again in the community platform. This
   * operation is essential for recovering posts that were deleted by mistake or
   * removed during moderation but later approved through appeals.
   *
   * When a post is deleted in the platform, it undergoes soft deletion where
   * the deleted_at timestamp is set but the post data remains in the
   * reddit_like_posts table along with all associated content in type-specific
   * tables (reddit_like_post_text_content, reddit_like_post_link_content, or
   * reddit_like_post_image_content). Soft deletion preserves the post
   * structure, comments, votes, and karma attribution while hiding the content
   * from public view.
   *
   * This restoration endpoint reverses the soft deletion by clearing the
   * deleted_at field, immediately making the post visible in community feeds,
   * user profiles, and search results. All previously earned karma from the
   * post remains intact per business requirements, and the post's engagement
   * metrics (votes, comments) are preserved.
   *
   * Authorization for post restoration depends on the context: post authors can
   * restore their own deleted posts, community moderators can restore posts
   * removed as part of moderation actions in their communities, and platform
   * administrators can restore any post platform-wide. The operation validates
   * that the requesting user has appropriate permissions before executing the
   * restoration.
   *
   * The restored post retains all its original metadata including creation
   * timestamp, vote scores, comment count, and karma attribution. The post
   * immediately appears in sorted feeds according to its original creation time
   * and current vote score, not the restoration time. This ensures restored
   * content integrates naturally into the existing content chronology rather
   * than appearing artificially recent.
