  /**
   * Submit a new appeal challenging a moderation action, community ban, or
   * platform suspension.
   *
   * Create a new moderation appeal allowing users to contest decisions made by
   * moderators or administrators. This operation implements the platform's due
   * process system as defined in the Content Moderation and Reporting
   * requirements section 8.
   *
   * When a user submits an appeal, they must provide written reasoning
   * explaining why they believe the moderation action should be reversed. The
   * appeal text must be between 50 and 1000 characters per business
   * requirements R-APP-006, ensuring sufficient detail while preventing
   * excessive submissions. Users must identify what they are appealing (content
   * removal, community ban, or platform suspension) through the appeal_type
   * field.
   *
   * The system validates that the user is the affected party for the moderation
   * action being appealed. For content removals, the user must be the content
   * author. For community bans, the user must be the banned member. For
   * platform suspensions, the user must be the suspended account. This prevents
   * users from appealing actions that don't affect them.
   *
   * Appeals are routed based on the action type per requirements R-APP-011 and
   * R-APP-012. Community-level appeals (content removals, community bans) are
   * sent to the community's moderator review queue. Platform suspension appeals
   * are routed to the administrator review queue. The routing ensures the
   * appropriate authority level reviews each appeal type.
   *
   * The system enforces the one appeal per action rule specified in
   * requirements R-APP-002 and R-APP-003. Users cannot submit multiple appeals
   * for the same moderation action, preventing appeal spam and ensuring
   * efficient review processes. If a user has already appealed a specific
   * action, subsequent appeal attempts are rejected.
   *
   * Upon successful submission, the appeal is marked with status 'pending' and
   * assigned an expected resolution timestamp calculated based on appeal type.
   * Community appeals target 2-3 day review, platform suspensions target 5-7
   * days, and escalated appeals target 7-10 days per requirement R-APP-029.
   * These expected timeframes enable SLA monitoring and automated reminder
   * notifications.
   *
   * The content author receives immediate confirmation of appeal submission per
   * requirement R-APP-009, including the expected review timeframe and
   * information about the review process. The appeal enters the moderation
   * queue where moderators or administrators can review, approve, deny, or
   * reduce penalties.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the reddit_like_moderation_appeals table to
   * persist appeal data, the reddit_like_moderation_logs table to create audit
   * trail entries, and the notification system to alert review queues and
   * provide status updates to appellants. Security considerations include
   * validating that the requesting user has permission to appeal the specific
   * action and preventing abuse through rate limiting on appeal submissions.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Appeal submission data including the action being appealed,
   *   appeal type, and user's written reasoning

  /**
   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of moderation appeals based
   * on user permissions.
   *
   * Retrieve moderation appeals with advanced filtering, sorting, and
   * pagination capabilities. This operation provides role-specific access to
   * appeals based on the requesting user's authorization level and implements
   * the appeal review queue functionality defined in Content Moderation
   * requirements section 8.3.
   *
   * For members (regular authenticated users), this operation returns only
   * appeals they have personally submitted. Members can view their appeal
   * history, track the status of pending appeals, and review decisions made on
   * their past appeals. This enables users to monitor their own due process
   * interactions without accessing other users' appeals. The filtering is
   * automatically scoped to appellant_member_id matching the authenticated
   * user's ID.
   *
   * For moderators, this operation returns appeals related to communities they
   * moderate. Moderators see appeals challenging actions taken in their
   * communities, including content removal appeals and community ban appeals
   * per requirement R-APP-011. The system filters results to only show appeals
   * where the community_id (inferred from the moderation action being appealed)
   * matches communities where the moderator has active moderator status. This
   * ensures moderators only access appeals within their moderation scope.
   *
   * For administrators, this operation returns all appeals across the entire
   * platform. Administrators can view community-level appeals, escalated
   * appeals, and platform suspension appeals per requirement R-APP-012. No
   * community filtering is applied for admin users, enabling platform-wide
   * appeal oversight and the ability to review escalated cases that moderators
   * couldn't resolve.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive filtering capabilities to help
   * reviewers manage appeal queues efficiently. Filter options include appeal
   * status (pending, under_review, upheld, overturned, reduced), appeal type
   * (content_removal, community_ban, platform_suspension), submission date
   * ranges, escalation status, and expected resolution timeframes. These
   * filters enable moderators and administrators to prioritize urgent appeals,
   * identify overdue reviews per requirement R-APP-030, and organize their
   * review workflows.
   *
   * Sorting options include submission time (newest or oldest first), expected
   * resolution date (most urgent first), appeal type, and status. The default
   * sorting shows pending appeals ordered by expected resolution date to
   * surface the most time-sensitive reviews first. This aligns with the SLA
   * monitoring requirements and helps ensure timely appeal resolution.
   *
   * Pagination parameters allow control over page size and navigation through
   * large appeal datasets. The response includes total appeal counts, current
   * page information, and pagination metadata to support efficient queue
   * browsing. For moderators managing active communities and administrators
   * handling platform-wide appeals, pagination prevents overwhelming data loads
   * while maintaining comprehensive access.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the reddit_like_moderation_appeals table for
   * appeal data retrieval, joins with reddit_like_moderation_actions,
   * reddit_like_community_bans, and reddit_like_platform_suspensions tables to
   * provide complete appeal context, and enforces row-level security based on
   * user roles to ensure proper access control. Performance optimizations
   * include indexed queries on status and expected_resolution_at fields to
   * support fast filtering and sorting.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict role-based access control enforced
   * at the database query level, validation that moderators only access appeals
   * for their assigned communities, prevention of unauthorized access to other
   * users' appeal data, and audit logging of all appeal list accesses for
   * security monitoring. The operation also implements rate limiting to prevent
   * abuse of the search functionality.
