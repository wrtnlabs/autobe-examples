  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated list of communities.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive filtered and paginated list of communities from
   * the Reddit-like platform. This operation provides advanced search
   * capabilities for discovering communities based on multiple criteria
   * including name matching, description keywords, category filters, privacy
   * settings, and activity status.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive pagination with configurable page
   * sizes and multiple sorting options. Users can sort communities by
   * subscriber count, creation date, community name, or activity level in
   * ascending or descending order. This enables efficient community discovery
   * for both new users exploring the platform and existing users finding new
   * communities to join.
   *
   * Security considerations include appropriate filtering of private
   * communities based on the requesting user's authorization level. Guest users
   * and members can discover public communities freely, while private
   * communities are hidden from general search unless the user has been granted
   * access. The operation enforces community privacy settings defined in the
   * reddit_like_communities table.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the Community table as defined in the Prisma
   * schema (reddit_like_communities), incorporating all available community
   * fields and relationships including creator information, subscriber counts,
   * category tags, and privacy settings. The response includes community
   * summary information optimized for list displays in browse and search
   * interfaces.
   *
   * The search functionality supports partial matching on community names and
   * descriptions using PostgreSQL trigram indexes (gin_trgm_ops) for efficient
   * full-text search performance. Filter options include primary category
   * selection, privacy type filtering (public/private), archived status
   * filtering, and minimum subscriber count thresholds. Time range filters
   * allow discovering recently created communities or filtering by creation
   * date ranges.
   *
   * This operation is essential for the community discovery workflow described
   * in requirements section 3.1-3.4, enabling users to browse communities by
   * category, search for specific topics, find trending communities, and
   * discover new communities based on their interests. The operation powers the
   * community directory interface and search functionality that helps users
   * navigate the platform's organizational structure.

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information about a specific community by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve complete detailed information about a specific community on the
   * Reddit-like platform. This operation provides comprehensive community data
   * necessary for rendering the community page, including all community
   * metadata, configuration settings, rules, moderator information, and
   * engagement statistics.
   *
   * The operation returns the community's core identification and branding
   * information including the unique community code (used in URLs), display
   * name, description, icon URL, and banner URL. Visual branding elements
   * enable community identity and recognition throughout the platform. The
   * description field contains the 10-500 character explanation of the
   * community's purpose and topic as defined during community creation.
   *
   * Community configuration settings are included in the response, such as
   * privacy type (public or private), posting permissions (anyone_subscribed,
   * approved_only, or moderators_only), and content type restrictions (whether
   * text posts, link posts, and image posts are allowed). These settings
   * control who can participate in the community and what types of content can
   * be shared, as specified in the community management requirements.
   *
   * The response includes categorization and discovery metadata such as the
   * primary category assignment (Technology, Gaming, Sports, Entertainment,
   * Education, Science, Arts, News, Lifestyle, Business, Other) and up to three
   * secondary tags for improved discoverability. These fields power community
   * search and recommendation features as described in requirements section
   * 7.2.
   *
   * Engagement statistics are provided including the total subscriber count
   * (denormalized for performance) and archived status flag. The subscriber
   * count reflects the community's size and popularity, while the archived flag
   * indicates whether the community is still accepting new content or has been
   * archived due to inactivity per requirements section 9.3.
   *
   * Security considerations include enforcing privacy settings based on the
   * requesting user's authorization. Public communities return full information
   * to all users including guests. Private communities require the user to be
   * an approved member or moderator before revealing detailed information.
   * Guest users and non-members attempting to access private communities
   * receive limited information with a prompt to request access.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the reddit_like_communities table from the
   * Prisma schema, utilizing the creator relationship to include creator
   * information, and accessing related community rules through the
   * reddit_like_community_rules relationship. The operation serves as the
   * foundation for displaying community pages where users view posts,
   * subscribe, and understand community standards.
   *
   * The response includes temporal metadata such as creation timestamp (when
   * the community was founded) and last update timestamp (when community
   * settings were modified), enabling users to understand community age and
   * activity recency. The soft deletion timestamp (deleted_at) is checked to
   * prevent access to communities in the 30-day deletion cooldown period.
