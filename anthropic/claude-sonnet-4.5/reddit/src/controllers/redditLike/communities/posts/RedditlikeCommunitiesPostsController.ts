  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated list of posts in a community.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive filtered and paginated list of posts within a
   * specific community from the Reddit-like platform. This operation provides
   * advanced search and discovery capabilities for finding posts based on
   * multiple criteria including post type (text, link, image), time range
   * filters, voting thresholds, and sorting preferences.
   *
   * The operation supports all four core sorting algorithms defined in the
   * Content Sorting Algorithms specification: Hot (trending content with time
   * decay and engagement velocity), New (strict chronological ordering), Top
   * (highest vote scores with time range filters), and Controversial
   * (polarizing content with balanced voting patterns). The default sorting is
   * Hot to surface currently trending content.
   *
   * This endpoint serves multiple user scenarios: casual browsing for
   * interesting content, community exploration for new members discovering top
   * posts, active community members checking latest submissions via New
   * sorting, and users seeking debates through Controversial sorting. The
   * operation integrates with the voting system to calculate vote scores, the
   * karma system for content quality signals, and the comment system to display
   * engagement metrics.
   *
   * Security considerations include respecting community privacy settings
   * (public vs private communities), enforcing read permissions based on user
   * authentication and community membership for private communities, and
   * applying rate limiting for search operations to prevent abuse. Guest users
   * can access public community posts, while private community posts require
   * authenticated membership or approval.
   *
   * The operation returns post summary information optimized for feed displays,
   * including post metadata (title, type, author, timestamps, vote scores,
   * comment counts), type-specific preview content (text excerpt, link metadata
   * with thumbnails, image thumbnails), and engagement metrics from the
   * mv_reddit_like_post_metrics materialized view for performance optimization.
   * Pagination parameters control result set size and offset for efficient
   * browsing of large post collections.

  /**
   * Retrieve hot-sorted trending posts from a specific community.
   *
   * Retrieve a paginated list of posts from a specific community sorted by the
   * Hot algorithm, which surfaces trending content that is currently gaining
   * momentum and engagement. This operation serves as the primary content
   * discovery mechanism for community feeds, implementing the Hot sorting
   * algorithm defined in the Content Sorting Algorithms requirements.
   *
   * The Hot sorting algorithm balances multiple factors to determine post
   * ranking. It uses net vote score (upvotes minus downvotes) from the
   * mv_reddit_like_post_metrics materialized view as the primary popularity
   * factor, applies time decay so older posts gradually decrease in ranking
   * even with high vote counts, and provides engagement velocity boosts for
   * posts receiving rapid votes within their first hours. Posts created within
   * the last 6-12 hours receive advantages over older posts with similar vote
   * counts, and posts gaining 10+ votes in the first hour rank higher than
   * posts with the same votes accumulated over 6 hours.
   *
   * The operation queries the reddit_like_posts table filtered by the
   * community_id path parameter, joining with mv_reddit_like_post_metrics for
   * denormalized vote scores and comment counts to optimize query performance.
   * The Hot score is recalculated periodically to ensure feed freshness and
   * accurate trending status. Posts with net negative votes are assigned very
   * low hot scores to suppress poor quality content, while newly created posts
   * receive initial hot scores that provide brief visibility opportunity before
   * time decay applies.
   *
   * The request body supports pagination parameters (page number, page size)
   * and optional filtering criteria such as time range restrictions to limit
   * posts to recent time windows. The response returns post summary information
   * optimized for feed display, including post ID, title, author information,
   * community association, vote scores, comment counts, post type, creation
   * timestamp, and Hot ranking score. Posts are ordered from highest Hot score
   * to lowest, creating a dynamic, ever-changing feed that encourages frequent
   * user visits.
   *
   * Security considerations include rate limiting for feed requests to prevent
   * abuse, and appropriate filtering based on the requesting user's
   * authorization level and community access permissions. Public communities
   * allow all users including guests to access Hot-sorted posts, while private
   * communities restrict access to approved members only. The operation
   * integrates with the community subscription system to power personalized
   * home feeds aggregating Hot posts from multiple subscribed communities.
   *
   * This operation is critical for user engagement and retention, as it
   * surfaces fresh, relevant content that keeps users engaged and returning to
   * the platform. Performance expectations require displaying results within 2
   * seconds under normal load conditions, with efficient caching of frequently
   * accessed community feeds to reduce database load.
