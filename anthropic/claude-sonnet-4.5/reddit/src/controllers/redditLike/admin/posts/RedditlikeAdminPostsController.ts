   * Create a new post in a community.
   *
   * Create a new post within a specified community on the Reddit-like platform.
   * This operation enables authenticated members to share content with
   * communities through three distinct post types: text posts for written
   * discussions and questions, link posts for sharing external web content, and
   * image posts for uploading and sharing visual media.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the reddit_like_posts table as the main post
   * entity, along with type-specific content tables based on the post type
   * discriminator. When creating a text post, the system stores the body
   * content in reddit_like_post_text_content with support for markdown
   * formatting up to 40,000 characters. For link posts, the system validates
   * the URL, stores it in reddit_like_post_link_content, and attempts to
   * extract Open Graph metadata including preview title, description, and
   * thumbnail image. Image posts require file upload with validation of format
   * (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP), size (maximum 20MB), and automatic generation of
   * multiple image versions (original, medium 640px, thumbnail 150x150) stored
   * in reddit_like_post_image_content.
   *
   * Security considerations include verifying the user is authenticated as a
   * member, moderator, or administrator per the reddit_like_users role field.
   * The system must validate the user is not banned from the target community
   * by checking reddit_like_community_bans for active bans where
   * banned_member_id matches the authenticated user and community_id matches
   * the target community. Community-specific posting permissions from
   * reddit_like_communities.posting_permission must be enforced, restricting
   * posting based on subscription status or moderator approval. Content
   * validation prevents XSS attacks through sanitization, validates URLs
   * against malicious site databases, and enforces anti-spam rate limiting
   * (maximum 10 posts per hour, 5 posts per day for accounts less than 24 hours
   * old).
   *
   * The operation initializes new posts with vote_score of 0, created_at
   * timestamp, and associates the post with the authenticated user's ID
   * (reddit_like_member_id) and selected community ID
   * (reddit_like_community_id). All post titles must be 3-300 characters with
   * leading/trailing whitespace trimmed. The type-specific content undergoes
   * additional validation: text body limited to 40,000 characters with markdown
   * support, URLs validated for HTTP/HTTPS protocol and maximum 2,000
   * characters, and images validated for format, size, dimensions, and
   * integrity.
   *
   * Related API operations include PATCH /posts for searching and retrieving
   * posts with filtering, GET /posts/{postId} for viewing individual post
   * details, PUT /posts/{postId} for editing post content within allowed time
   * windows, and DELETE /posts/{postId} for soft-deleting posts. Community
   * subscription status affects posting permissions and is validated through
   * reddit_like_community_subscriptions. The created post immediately becomes
   * available for voting through the reddit_like_post_votes table and
   * commenting through the reddit_like_comments table, contributing to the
   * author's post karma tracked in reddit_like_user_karma.

  /**
   * Remove a post by ID from the reddit_like_posts table.
   *
   * Remove a specific post identified by its unique post ID as part of
   * platform-wide content governance and policy enforcement. When an
   * administrator removes a post, the content is hidden from public view while
   * preserving the database record for audit purposes, legal compliance, and
   * appeal processes. The removal marks the post as deleted across the entire
   * platform, making it invisible to all users while maintaining the complete
   * record for administrative review.
   *
   * This operation is available to three user roles with different
   * authorization contexts: the post author (member who created the post) can
   * delete their own content at any time as part of content ownership rights,
   * community moderators can remove posts within the communities they moderate
   * as part of their content moderation responsibilities, and platform
   * administrators can delete any post across all communities for platform-wide
   * policy enforcement.
   *
   * When a post is removed by an administrator, the content is hidden from
   * public view and removed from community feeds, search results, and sorting
   * algorithms across the entire platform. The system displays a placeholder
   * message 'This post has been removed by administrators' to indicate
   * platform-level action rather than community moderation or author deletion.
   * The post record remains in the database with all metadata intact including
   * the post ID, title, community association, author information, and
   * timestamps, enabling administrators to maintain comprehensive audit trails
   * for legal compliance and policy enforcement review.
   *
   * Associated comments remain accessible and visible to maintain thread
   * integrity and preserve valuable discussions. The comment section displays
   * with a notice indicating the parent post has been removed by
   * administrators, but all comment content, voting, and threading
   * functionality continues to work normally. This design ensures that
   * community discussions are not lost when posts are removed for platform
   * policy violations, maintaining the value of user contributions in comment
   * threads even when parent content violates platform-wide rules.
   *
   * Vote scores and karma points previously earned from the deleted post are
   * preserved according to the karma system requirements defined in document
   * 07-karma-system.md section 4.4. This prevents users from manipulating their
   * reputation by creating content to gain karma and then deleting
   * poorly-received posts to avoid karma loss. The karma earned from a post
   * persists even after deletion, maintaining the integrity of the reputation
   * system across all user roles.
   *
   * The deletion workflow validates that the authenticated user has
   * administrator privileges before proceeding with the removal operation.
   * Administrators have unrestricted deletion capabilities across all
   * communities without needing community-specific moderator status. This
   * platform-wide authority enables administrators to enforce platform
   * policies, handle escalated moderation issues, and remove content that
   * violates terms of service regardless of community-level moderation
   * decisions.
   *
   * Related operations include POST /communities/{communityId}/posts for
   * creating posts that may later require platform-level intervention, GET
   * /posts/{postId} for retrieving post details before making removal
   * decisions, the appeal system defined in Content Moderation and Reporting
   * requirements for users to contest administrator actions, and the
   * platform-wide moderation logging system that records all administrator
   * removals with detailed reasoning for transparency and legal compliance.

  /**
   * Remove a post from a community for rule violations.
   *
   * Remove a specific post from a community due to content policy violations or
   * community rule infractions. This operation is available to community
   * moderators within their assigned communities and to platform administrators
   * across all communities. The operation implements soft deletion by setting
   * the deleted_at timestamp on the reddit_like_posts record while preserving
   * all post data for audit trail and potential appeal processes.
   *
   * When a post is removed, the system creates detailed records in both
   * reddit_like_moderation_actions and reddit_like_moderation_logs tables to
   * maintain a comprehensive audit trail. The moderation action record captures
   * the removal type (community, platform, or spam), the reason category and
   * detailed explanation, and any internal notes for the moderation team. The
   * moderation log provides an immutable historical record of the removal event
   * with full context.
   *
   * Security and authorization are enforced at multiple levels. Moderators must
   * have the 'manage_posts' permission in the specific community where the post
   * exists. The system validates that the moderator's role assignments in
   * reddit_like_community_moderators table grant them authority over the target
   * community. Administrators bypass community-specific checks and can remove
   * posts platform-wide. The operation rejects requests from regular members
   * attempting to remove posts they don't own.
   *
   * The removal process immediately hides the post content from public feeds,
   * search results, and community listings by filtering based on the deleted_at
   * timestamp. However, the post structure, metadata, title, and community
   * association are preserved. All associated comments remain accessible with a
   * notice indicating the parent post was removed, maintaining discussion
   * continuity and preserving valuable community conversations. The post author
   * receives a notification within 5 minutes explaining which content was
   * removed, the stated reason, and information about the appeal process.
   *
   * Removal types determine the scope of content hiding. Community-level
   * removals hide content from the specific community but may remain visible in
   * the author's profile. Platform-level removals by administrators hide
   * content from all views due to platform-wide policy violations. Spam
   * removals not only hide the content but also reverse any karma earned from
   * that content according to anti-manipulation measures. The removal_type
   * field in the request body specifies which removal scope to apply.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the broader content moderation system
   * defined in the Content Moderation and Reporting requirements document.
   * Removals can be triggered either reactively (in response to content reports
   * in reddit_like_content_reports) or proactively by moderators. When removing
   * content in response to a report, the moderator provides the report_id to
   * link the action to the triggering report. The moderation action updates the
   * report status to 'reviewed' and creates the connection for tracking report
   * resolution metrics.
   *
   * The operation supports the appeal workflow by preserving all removed
   * content and maintaining detailed reasoning. Users can appeal removals
   * through the reddit_like_moderation_appeals table, referencing the
   * moderation action record created by this operation. Moderators and
   * administrators reviewing appeals have access to the complete context
   * including the original removal reason, internal notes, and content state at
   * time of removal.

   * Restore a soft-deleted post to make it visible again.

   * timestamp, making the post visible again in the community platform. This
   * operation is essential for recovering posts that were deleted by mistake or
   * removed during moderation but later approved through appeals.
   *
   * When a post is deleted in the platform, it undergoes soft deletion where
   * the deleted_at timestamp is set but the post data remains in the
   * reddit_like_posts table along with all associated content in type-specific
   * tables (reddit_like_post_text_content, reddit_like_post_link_content, or
   * reddit_like_post_image_content). Soft deletion preserves the post
   * structure, comments, votes, and karma attribution while hiding the content
   * from public view.
   *
   * This restoration endpoint reverses the soft deletion by clearing the
   * deleted_at field, immediately making the post visible in community feeds,
   * user profiles, and search results. All previously earned karma from the
   * post remains intact per business requirements, and the post's engagement
   * metrics (votes, comments) are preserved.
   *
   * Authorization for post restoration depends on the context: post authors can
   * restore their own deleted posts, community moderators can restore posts
   * removed as part of moderation actions in their communities, and platform
   * administrators can restore any post platform-wide. The operation validates
   * that the requesting user has appropriate permissions before executing the

   * timestamp, vote scores, comment count, and karma attribution. The post
   * immediately appears in sorted feeds according to its original creation time
   * and current vote score, not the restoration time. This ensures restored
   * content integrates naturally into the existing content chronology rather
