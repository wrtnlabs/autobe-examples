   *
   * System settings control various platform behaviors such as maximum post

   * toggle flags, and other configurable system parameters. Each setting has a

   * to retrieve configuration values.
   *
   * This endpoint is primarily used by platform administrators to inspect
   * current configuration values, understand setting purposes through
   * descriptions, and prepare for configuration updates. The value_type field
   * indicates how to deserialize the string value (string, int, double,
   * boolean, json), enabling proper type handling in application logic.
   *
   * Security considerations require that this operation be restricted to
   * administrator users only, as system settings may contain sensitive
   * configuration data affecting platform-wide behavior. The is_public field
   * indicates whether a setting can be safely exposed via public API, with
   * internal-only settings (like API keys or security parameters) kept
   * confidential.
   *
   * This operation integrates with system configuration management workflows
   * and may be used in conjunction with setting update operations to review
   * current values before modifications. Settings are categorized (content,
   * moderation, performance, features) to help administrators organize and
   * locate related configuration parameters efficiently.

   *
   * This operation validates that the provided setting ID exists in the system

   * performance. Changes to settings take effect immediately upon successful
   * update, though some settings may require application restart or cache
   * invalidation to fully apply.
   *
   * The operation updates the settings metadata including the description,
   * value_type, category classification, and public visibility flag. The
   * updated_at timestamp is automatically set to the current time to track when
   * the configuration was last modified, providing an audit trail for
   * configuration changes.

   * an appropriate error response. Upon successful deletion, the setting is
   * immediately and permanently removed from the database, and all references
   * to this configuration are lost.
   *
   * Care should be taken when deleting system settings, as the application may
   * depend on certain configuration parameters to function correctly.
   * Administrators should verify that removing a setting will not break
   * platform functionality or cause runtime errors in components that reference
   * the setting.
   *
   * Before deleting a setting, consider whether disabling it (by changing its
   * value or is_public flag) would be more appropriate than permanent removal.
   * Settings that may be needed in the future should be disabled rather than
   * deleted to preserve configuration history and enable easy re-activation.
