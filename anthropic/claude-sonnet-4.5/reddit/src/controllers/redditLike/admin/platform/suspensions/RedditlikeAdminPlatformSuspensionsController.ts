   * Issue a platform-wide suspension for a member user.
   *
   * Issue a platform-wide suspension that prevents a member from accessing the
   * entire Reddit-like community platform. This operation is restricted to
   * administrators only and represents the most severe moderation action
   * available, affecting the user's ability to perform any authenticated
   * actions across all communities.
   *
   * Platform suspensions are issued for serious violations of platform-wide
   * policies including repeated rule violations across multiple communities,
   * severe harassment, spam campaigns, hate speech, illegal content posting, or
   * ban evasion attempts. Unlike community-level bans which are scoped to
   * specific communities, platform suspensions deny all platform access and
   * prevent the user from logging in.
   *
   * The operation creates a new record in the reddit_like_platform_suspensions
   * table with references to the suspended member and the issuing
   * administrator. Per business requirements R-BAN-013, suspensions can be
   * temporary (3 days, 7 days, 30 days) or permanent account termination.
   * Temporary suspensions automatically restore user access when the expiration
   * date passes through system automation.
   *
   * When a suspension is issued, the system sends an email notification to the
   * user's registered email address immediately per requirement R-BAN-020,
   * including the suspension type, duration, detailed reason, and information
   * about the appeal process per R-BAN-021. The notification includes a direct
   * link to the appeal submission form.
   *
   * All suspension actions are logged in the reddit_like_moderation_logs table
   * per requirement R-BAN-018, creating an immutable audit trail with the
   * administrator identity, suspension reason, timestamp, and IP address for
   * accountability and legal compliance. The suspension record stores both a
   * predefined reason category and detailed reason text for transparency.
   *
   * Suspended users attempting to log in will be denied access with a message
   * displaying the suspension reason and duration per requirement R-BAN-012.
   * For temporary suspensions, the message includes the expiration date. The
   * system enforces suspensions by validating user status during authentication
   * workflows and rejecting login attempts from suspended accounts.

   * Search and retrieve filtered platform suspensions with pagination.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of all platform-wide
   * suspensions issued by administrators. This operation provides advanced
   * search and filtering capabilities for monitoring platform safety, reviewing
   * suspension history, analyzing suspension patterns, and managing active
   * suspensions across the entire platform.
   *
   * The operation queries the reddit_like_platform_suspensions table with
   * support for multiple filter criteria including suspension status (active,
   * expired, lifted), permanence type (temporary or permanent), member
   * identifiers, issuing administrator, date ranges, and reason categories.
   * Results can be sorted by various fields including creation date, expiration
   * date, and member username for flexible data exploration.
   *
   * This search functionality serves multiple administrative use cases.
   * Administrators monitoring platform health can filter for active suspensions
   * to see currently banned users. Historical analysis requires filtering by
   * date ranges to understand suspension trends over time. When reviewing
   * specific cases, administrators can filter by member ID or username to see a
   * user's complete suspension history across all incidents.
   *
   * Pagination support is essential given the potential for thousands of
   * suspension records as the platform scales. The operation returns paginated
   * results with configurable page sizes, total count metadata, and navigation
   * information. This enables efficient browsing through large suspension
   * datasets without performance degradation.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict role-based access control ensuring
   * only administrators can access suspension data, which contains sensitive
   * information about user violations and platform policy enforcement. The
   * operation integrates with the authentication system to verify administrator
   * credentials before processing requests.
   *
   * The response includes comprehensive suspension information from the
   * reddit_like_platform_suspensions table including suspension reasons,
   * durations, status, related member details, and audit timestamps. For each
   * suspension, the system provides the member username, suspension category,
   * detailed reason text, permanence flag, expiration date (if applicable),
   * active status, issuing administrator, and creation timestamp.
   *
   * This operation supports the administrator dashboard and moderation
   * oversight requirements specified in the Content Moderation and Reporting
   * document, enabling administrators to fulfill their platform governance
   * responsibilities through efficient suspension data access and analysis.

   * The suspension information integrates with the

  /**
   * Lift a platform suspension and restore user access.
   *
   * Remove an active platform suspension by setting the soft delete timestamp
   * and deactivating the suspension record. This operation restores the
   * suspended member's full access to the platform, allowing them to log in and
   * participate in all communities again. The suspension record is preserved in
   * the database through soft deletion to maintain the complete moderation
   * audit trail and suspension history.
   *
   * This endpoint is exclusively available to platform administrators who have
   * the authority to lift platform-wide suspensions. Administrators use this
   * operation in several scenarios: when handling successful appeals where the
   * suspension is overturned, when correcting suspension errors or mistaken
   * identity cases, when reducing penalties as part of partial appeal
   * acceptance, or when implementing early release for users who have
   * demonstrated rehabilitation.
   *
   * The operation updates the reddit_like_platform_suspensions table as defined
   * in the Prisma schema. When a suspension is lifted, the system sets the
   * deleted_at field to the current timestamp (implementing the soft delete
   * pattern present in the schema), updates the is_active field to false to
   * disable the suspension, and records the updated_at timestamp. The
   * suspension record remains in the database for historical tracking, audit
   * compliance, and pattern analysis of repeat offenders.
   *
   * Security and authorization considerations include strict administrator-only
   * access enforcement, logging of all suspension lift actions in the
   * reddit_like_moderation_logs table for accountability, and notification
   * requirements that inform the previously suspended user via email that their
   * access has been restored. The operation validates that the suspension
   * exists and is currently active before attempting to lift it.
   *
   * Related operations include the suspension retrieval endpoint (GET
   * /platform/suspensions/{suspensionId}) for viewing suspension details before
   * lifting, the suspension creation endpoint (POST /platform/suspensions) for
   * issuing new suspensions, the appeal review endpoint where administrators
   * decide whether to lift suspensions based on user appeals, and the
   * moderation logs endpoint which tracks all suspension lifecycle events
   * including issuance and lifting.
   *
   * Important business rules enforced by this operation include that lifted
   * suspensions cannot be reactivated (a new suspension must be issued
   * instead), all existing user sessions are invalidated when a suspension is
   * lifted to force fresh authentication, and the user receives notification of
   * the restoration within the notification SLA timeframe.
