  /**
   * Retrieve filtered list of content reports for moderation queue.
   *
   * Retrieves a filtered and paginated list of content reports submitted by
   * users for moderator and administrator review. This operation provides the
   * primary interface for the moderation queue, enabling moderators to
   * efficiently process reports of potentially rule-violating content.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive filtering and search capabilities to
   * help moderators manage large volumes of reports effectively. Moderators can
   * filter by report status (pending review, already reviewed, or dismissed),
   * violation category (spam, harassment, hate speech, etc.), specific
   * community, content type (posts vs comments), priority level (high-priority
   * reports flagged by the system), and date ranges. Multiple filters can be
   * combined to narrow down the queue to specific subsets of reports requiring
   * attention.
   *
   * Access control ensures moderators only see reports for communities where
   * they have moderation permissions, while platform administrators have
   * visibility into all reports across the entire platform. This scoped access
   * prevents unauthorized review of reports outside a moderator's jurisdiction
   * while enabling centralized oversight by administrators.
   *
   * The response includes detailed report information for each item in the
   * queue: the reported content preview, content author details, violation
   * categories selected by reporters, number of reports for the same content,
   * submission timestamps, and current review status. When multiple users
   * report the same content, these reports are grouped together with a count
   * indicator to signal widespread community concern.
   *
   * The operation supports sorting by various criteria including submission
   * time (newest or oldest first), priority level (high-priority reports
   * first), and report count (most-reported content first). Pagination enables
   * efficient loading of large report queues without performance degradation.
   * The default sort order presents newest reports first to ensure timely
   * review of fresh submissions.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the broader moderation workflow by providing
   * the entry point where moderators access reports before taking actions such
   * as content removal, user bans, or report dismissal. The queue interface
   * helps moderators meet expected review timeframes and maintain community
   * standards through efficient report processing.

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information about a specific content report.
   *
   * Retrieve comprehensive details for a specific content report identified by
   * its unique report ID. This operation provides moderators and administrators
   * with all information necessary to review and act on user-submitted reports
   * of potentially inappropriate content.
   *
   * The operation returns complete report information including the type of
   * content being reported (post or comment), the violation categories selected
   * by the reporter, any additional context provided, the current review
   * status, and metadata about when the report was submitted. For authenticated
   * reporters, the system includes the reporter's username to help moderators
   * assess report credibility. For anonymous guest reports, the reporter is
   * identified as 'Anonymous'.
   *
   * This endpoint integrates with the content moderation workflow defined in
   * the Content Moderation and Reporting requirements document. The retrieved
   * report information enables moderators to make informed decisions about
   * whether to remove content, dismiss reports as false positives, ban users,
   * or escalate to administrators. The response includes references to the
   * reported content (post ID or comment ID) allowing moderators to view the
   * content in context before taking action.
   *
   * Security considerations include restricting access to moderators and
   * administrators only, as content reports contain sensitive information about
   * reporters and reported users. The system enforces role-based access control
   * ensuring moderators can only access reports for communities they moderate,
   * while administrators have platform-wide report access.
   *
   * This operation supports the moderator review queue functionality by
   * providing the detailed view when moderators click on queue items to
   * investigate reports thoroughly. The comprehensive report details enable
   * fair and informed moderation decisions that balance community safety with
   * user rights.
