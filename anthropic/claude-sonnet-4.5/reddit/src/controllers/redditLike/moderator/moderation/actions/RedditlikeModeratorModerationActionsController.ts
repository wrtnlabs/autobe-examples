  /**
   * Create a new moderation action to address reported or problematic content.
   *
   * Create a comprehensive moderation action record documenting a moderator or
   * administrator's decision regarding reported content or proactive content
   * management. This operation is the central mechanism for enforcing community
   * rules and platform policies through formal moderation actions.
   *
   * The operation requires specification of the action type (remove, approve,
   * dismiss_report, escalate, restore, lock), the content being acted upon
   * (post or comment), and detailed reasoning for the action. For removal
   * actions, the system requires additional specification of removal scope
   * (community-level, platform-level, or spam removal). The operation
   * associates actions with triggering reports when applicable, creating a
   * complete audit trail linking user reports to moderator responses.
   *
   * When a moderation action is successfully created, the system immediately
   * executes the specified action on the target content. For removal actions,
   * content is hidden from public view within 1 second per performance
   * requirements. For ban-related actions, user permissions are updated
   * immediately. The system automatically sends notifications to affected
   * content authors informing them of the action taken, the reason, and
   * information about the appeal process per requirements section R-REM-015
   * through R-REM-017.
   *
   * The operation enforces strict authorization rules based on user role and
   * community scope. Moderators can only create moderation actions for
   * communities where they have moderator permissions, while administrators can
   * take actions across all communities. The system validates that the actor
   * (moderator or admin) has appropriate permissions before executing the
   * action.
   *
   * This endpoint integrates deeply with the Content Moderation and Reporting
   * requirements, implementing the core moderation workflow where reports are
   * reviewed and actions are taken. The created moderation action becomes part
   * of the permanent moderation log per requirements section 9, providing
   * accountability and enabling appeals. The action record includes the actor's
   * identity (moderator or admin), timestamps for audit purposes, and detailed
   * reasoning for transparency.
   *
   * For content removal actions specifically, the system follows the removal
   * process defined in requirements section 6, preserving removed content in
   * the database for audit and appeal purposes while hiding it from public
   * view. The removal type field distinguishes between community-level removals
   * (content hidden from community but visible in user profile) and
   * platform-level removals (content completely hidden from all views).
   *
   * Related operations that may be used together include retrieving content
   * reports to review before taking action, and subsequently checking
   * moderation logs to verify action completion.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Moderation action details including action type, affected
   *   content, removal scope, and detailed reasoning

  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered moderation actions with pagination.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, searchable list of moderation actions taken
   * across the platform or within specific communities. This operation provides
   * powerful filtering and sorting capabilities essential for moderation
   * oversight, policy enforcement review, and accountability tracking.
   * Moderators can review all actions within their assigned communities, while
   * administrators can query moderation activity platform-wide.
   *
   * The search functionality supports multiple filter dimensions including
   * community scope (filter by specific communities or view all), action types
   * (remove, approve, dismiss, escalate, restore, lock), content types (posts
   * vs comments), status (completed, reversed, appealed), and date ranges for
   * temporal analysis. Additional filters allow searching by the moderator or
   * administrator who performed actions, enabling performance reviews and
   * activity auditing.
   *
   * This operation is critical for several moderation workflows. Moderator
   * teams use it to review recent enforcement decisions for consistency,
   * identify patterns in rule violations, and coordinate moderation strategies
   * across team members. Administrators leverage this endpoint to audit
   * community moderation quality, investigate user complaints about moderator
   * actions, and ensure platform-wide policy compliance.
   *
   * The response provides paginated results with configurable page sizes and
   * sorting options. Users can sort by action timestamp (newest or oldest
   * first), action type, or status to organize results for their specific
   * analysis needs. Each result includes summary information about the action,
   * affected content, and actor, with links to detailed action records.
   *
   * Security and privacy considerations ensure that internal moderator notes
   * and sensitive moderation context are only visible to authorized moderators
   * and administrators. The endpoint enforces strict role-based access control,
   * limiting moderators to viewing actions within their assigned communities
   * while granting administrators full platform visibility.
   *
   * Integration with the broader moderation system includes connections to
   * content reports that triggered actions, appeals filed against actions, and
   * audit logs tracking the complete moderation lifecycle. This enables
   * comprehensive analysis of moderation effectiveness and fairness across the
   * platform.

   * a moderation decision including what action was taken (remove, approve,
   * dismiss, escalate, restore, lock), who performed the action (moderator or
   * administrator), what content was affected (post or comment), the reasoning
   * behind the decision, and the current status of the action.
   *
   * This endpoint is essential for moderation transparency and accountability.
   * Moderators can review their own past actions to maintain consistency in
   * enforcement. Administrators can audit moderation decisions across the
   * platform to ensure policy compliance and fairness. The operation also
   * supports appeal processes by providing the detailed context users need to
   * understand why their content was moderated.
   *
   * The returned data includes references to the triggering report (if action
   * was report-driven), the affected content (post or comment), the community
   * context, and complete reasoning with both public explanation and internal
   * moderator notes. Status tracking shows whether actions remain in effect,
   * have been reversed, or are under appeal.
   *
   * Security considerations require that internal moderator notes are only
   * visible to users with moderator or administrator privileges. Regular
   * members should not see private moderation team communications. The endpoint
   * enforces role-based access control to ensure only authorized users can view
   * sensitive moderation details.
