  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered moderation log entries with pagination and

   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of moderation log entries from the
   * comprehensive audit trail system. This operation provides access to the
   * reddit_like_moderation_logs table, which records all moderation system
   * activities including report submissions, moderation actions, ban issuances,
   * appeal submissions, and appeal decisions.
   *
   * The moderation logs serve as a permanent, immutable audit trail for
   * accountability, transparency, and legal compliance per requirements
   * R-LOG-001 through R-LOG-005. Each log entry captures complete context
   * including the actor who performed the action (member, moderator, or admin),
   * the related moderation entities (reports, actions, bans, suspensions,
   * appeals), the community context, event type, human-readable action
   * description, and precise timestamp with second precision.
   *
   * This operation supports comprehensive filtering and search capabilities to
   * help moderators and administrators efficiently find relevant log entries.
   * Filters include log type (report_submitted, action_taken, ban_issued,
   * etc.), actor role (member, moderator, admin), community context, time
   * ranges, and full-text search within action descriptions and metadata. The
   * search functionality uses the GIN trigram index on action_description for
   * efficient text matching.
   *
   * Access control enforces requirement R-LOG-008 allowing moderators to view
   * logs only for communities they moderate, while requirement R-LOG-009 grants
   * administrators access to complete platform-wide moderation history. The
   * system filters results based on the authenticated user's role and community
   * moderation assignments, ensuring proper data access boundaries.
   *
   * The operation returns paginated results with sorting options by timestamp
   * (newest first by default per R-LOG-010), log type, or community. Each log
   * entry includes comprehensive details about the moderation event, references
   * to related entities (with IDs for further lookup), and metadata context.
   * The pagination structure supports efficient browsing of large log datasets
   * while maintaining query performance through proper indexing on log_type,
   * created_at, actor IDs, and community_id.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the broader moderation system, providing
   * transparency into moderation decisions and enabling pattern analysis for
   * improving moderation effectiveness. The logs support moderator
   * accountability, user transparency (through public moderation logs per
   * R-LOG-015 through R-LOG-018), and administrative oversight of moderation
   * practices across the platform.

   * Retrieve a specific moderation log entry by ID.

   * Retrieve detailed information about a specific moderation log entry from

   * details of a single moderation event including the type of action
   * performed, who performed it (member, moderator, or administrator), what
   * content or user was affected, associated reports or appeals, community
   * context, and full event metadata.
   *
   * Moderation logs serve as the immutable historical record of all moderation
   * system activities on the platform. They provide accountability,
   * transparency, and audit capabilities for content reports, moderator
   * actions, community bans, platform suspensions, and appeal decisions. Each
   * log entry captures a snapshot of a moderation event with complete context
   * preserved for legal compliance and dispute resolution.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the reddit_like_moderation_logs table as
   * defined in the Prisma schema. The table maintains permanent records with
   * foreign key references to related entities including content reports,
   * moderation actions, community bans, platform suspensions, appeals, and the
   * communities where events occurred. The logs track the actor who performed
   * each action (which can be a member submitting a report, a moderator taking
   * action, or an administrator making decisions), along with IP addresses for
   * security auditing.
   *
   * Security considerations include role-based access control where moderators
   * can view logs for their assigned communities while administrators have
   * platform-wide log access. The operation returns complete log details
   * including internal notes and metadata that may contain sensitive moderation
   * context, so proper authorization verification is critical.
   *
   * The log entry includes comprehensive event information such as log type
   * categorization (report_submitted, action_taken, ban_issued, etc.),
   * human-readable action descriptions, JSON metadata with event-specific
   * details, and references to all related moderation entities. This enables
   * full reconstruction of moderation event timelines and provides the
   * transparency needed for user appeals and administrative oversight.
