  /**
   * Retrieve all public platform-wide configuration settings that are safe to
   * expose to all users including unauthenticated guests. This operation
   * queries the reddit_like_system_settings table filtering for records where
   * is_public is true, ensuring that only non-sensitive configuration
   * parameters are returned.
   *
   * Public settings typically include user-facing platform parameters that help
   * clients understand system constraints and capabilities. Examples include
   * maximum content lengths (max_post_length, max_comment_length), file upload
   * limits (max_image_file_size), rate limiting thresholds visible to users
   * (posts_per_hour_limit), and feature toggles that affect user experience
   * (image_posts_enabled, comment_editing_window).
   *
   * The response provides settings organized by their category field for easier
   * consumption, allowing client applications to reference specific parameter
   * groups. Each setting includes the key identifier, the value as a string,
   * the value_type indicator for proper deserialization, and the description
   * explaining the setting's purpose.
   *
   * This endpoint supports the platform's transparency principle by making
   * operational parameters visible to all users without requiring
   * authentication. Security is maintained by the is_public flag preventing
   * exposure of sensitive internal settings like API keys, security parameters,
   * or administrative thresholds.
   *
   * Since this endpoint returns reference data that changes infrequently,
   * client applications may cache the response with appropriate cache
   * invalidation strategies. The settings returned represent current platform
   * capabilities and constraints that clients should respect when submitting
   * content or making requests.
