   * Register new member account with username, email, and password, creating

   *
   * Registers a new member user account and issues initial JWT authentication
   * tokens for immediate platform access.
   *
   * This endpoint handles the complete user registration workflow defined in
   * requirements section 2 (User Registration Requirements). When a guest
   * visitor decides to join the platform, they submit registration credentials
   * (username, email, password) through this endpoint. The system validates all
   * input according to strict requirements: username must be 3-20 characters
   * with only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens; email must be
   * unique and valid format; password must be minimum 8 characters with
   * uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character.
   *
   * Upon successful validation, the system creates a new record in
   * reddit_like_members table with securely hashed password (never plain text),
   * generates unique user identifier, sets email_verified to false initially,
   * assigns default member role, and initializes both post_karma and
   * comment_karma to zero as specified in karma system requirements. The
   * registration process also creates related records in
   * reddit_like_auth_credentials for security tracking and
   * reddit_like_user_karma for reputation management.
   *
   * Immediately after account creation, the system generates JWT tokens per
   * session management requirements: access token with 30-minute expiration and
   * refresh token with 30-day expiration. Both tokens contain user ID,
   * username, and role in the payload. A verification email is sent
   * asynchronously to the provided email address with a unique time-limited
   * verification link expiring in 24 hours per requirements section 2.3.
   *
   * The response includes complete user profile information (id, username,
   * email, karma scores, account timestamps) along with both access and refresh
   * tokens, enabling the newly registered user to immediately begin
   * authenticated participation without additional login. This follows the
   * requirement that successful registration automatically logs in the new user
   * as a Member.
   *
   * Security considerations include rate limiting to prevent registration
   * abuse, CAPTCHA verification for suspicious patterns, username and email
   * uniqueness validation with helpful error messages when duplicates detected,
   * and secure password hashing using industry-standard algorithms (bcrypt,
   * Argon2, or PBKDF2). All authentication communications occur over HTTPS per
   * security requirements.

   *
   * Authenticates existing member users with email and password credentials,
   * issuing JWT tokens for platform access.
   *
   * This endpoint implements the login workflow defined in requirements section
   * 3 (Login and Session Management). When a registered member wants to access
   * their account, they submit their email address and password through this
   * endpoint. The system validates these credentials against stored account
   * information in the reddit_like_members table, comparing the submitted
   * password against the securely stored password_hash using cryptographic
   * verification.
   *
   * The authentication process follows strict security requirements: passwords
   * are never transmitted or stored in plain text, all authentication occurs
   * over HTTPS, and rate limiting prevents brute-force attacks by allowing
   * maximum 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes before temporarily locking the
   * account for 30 minutes. The reddit_like_auth_credentials table tracks
   * failed login attempts, last failed login timestamp, and account lock status
   * to enforce these security measures.
   *
   * If credentials are invalid (email doesn't exist or password doesn't match),
   * the system rejects login with generic error message "Invalid email or
   * password" to prevent username enumeration attacks. If the account is
   * temporarily locked due to multiple failed attempts, the system denies
   * access and notifies user of lock duration. If the account has been
   * suspended by administrators (checked in reddit_like_platform_suspensions
   * with is_active=true), the system prevents login and directs user to contact
   * support.
   *
   * Upon successful credential validation, the system generates new JWT tokens
   * per session management requirements: access token expiring in 30 minutes
   * containing user ID, username, and role; refresh token expiring in 30 days
   * for obtaining new access tokens without re-login. These tokens are stored
   * in a new reddit_like_sessions record along with IP address, user agent, and
   * activity timestamp for security monitoring. The system also updates
   * reddit_like_auth_credentials with successful login timestamp and IP
   * address, resetting failed attempt counter to zero.
   *
   * The response returns complete user profile information from
   * reddit_like_members (id, username, email, profile_bio, avatar_url,
   * email_verified status) along with denormalized karma scores (post_karma and
   * comment_karma) and both JWT tokens, enabling the authenticated user to
   * immediately access all member-level features including posting, commenting,
   * voting, and community subscription management.
   *
   * Security logging captures all authentication events including successful
   * logins, failed attempts, and account lock triggers for security monitoring
   * and forensic analysis per requirements section 3.6.

  /**
   * Refresh JWT access token using valid refresh token from
   * reddit_like_sessions, generating new 30-minute access token.
   *
   * Refreshes expired access tokens using valid refresh tokens, issuing new
   * access tokens without requiring credential re-entry.
   *
   * This endpoint implements the token refresh mechanism defined in
   * requirements section 3.2 (Session Management Requirements). When a member's
   * access token expires after 30 minutes of validity, they can obtain a new
   * access token by presenting their still-valid refresh token through this
   * endpoint, avoiding the need to re-enter email and password credentials.
   * This creates a seamless user experience for active platform participants.
   *
   * The refresh process validates the submitted refresh token against records
   * in reddit_like_sessions table, checking that the token matches an existing
   * session record, the refresh token hasn't expired (refresh_token_expires_at
   * is in the future), and the session hasn't been explicitly revoked
   * (deleted_at is null). If any of these validations fail, the system rejects
   * the refresh request and requires the user to log in again with full
   * credentials.
   *
   * Refresh tokens expire 30 days after issuance per requirements. This longer
   * validity period compared to access tokens (30 minutes) balances security
   * with user convenience - users remain authenticated for a month without
   * re-login, but their access tokens expire frequently to limit exposure if
   * compromised. When a refresh token has expired, the system returns an
   * authentication error requiring full re-login with email and password.
   *
   * Upon successful refresh token validation, the system generates a new JWT
   * access token with fresh 30-minute expiration timestamp, containing the
   * user's current ID, username, and role in the payload. The refresh token
   * itself remains unchanged and maintains its original expiration timestamp
   *
   * - Only the access token is regenerated. The system updates the
   *   reddit_like_sessions record's last_activity_at timestamp to reflect
   *   current usage and updates the access_token field with the newly generated
   *   token.
   *
   * The response includes the new access token along with current user profile
   * information from reddit_like_members, including any updates to username,
   * profile_bio, avatar_url, or email_verified status that may have occurred
   * since the original login. The response also includes current karma scores
   * (post_karma and comment_karma) reflecting all voting activity on the user's
   * content since last token refresh.
   *
   * Security considerations include validating that the session's user account
   * still exists and hasn't been suspended (checking
   * reddit_like_platform_suspensions for active suspensions), ensuring
   * HTTPS-only communication for token transmission, and logging all token
   * refresh events in reddit_like_auth_credentials for security monitoring. If
   * a user changes their password, all existing sessions are invalidated
   * (deleted_at set) per requirements section 2.6, forcing re-authentication
   * and preventing refresh token usage.
