  /**
   * Request password reset for member account by email, creating time-limited
   * reset token in reddit_like_password_resets table and sending reset link.
   *
   * Initiates password reset workflow by generating and sending time-limited
   * reset token to user's registered email address.
   *
   * This endpoint implements the forgot password mechanism defined in
   * requirements section 2.2 (Password Reset Requirements). When users cannot
   * access their accounts because they've forgotten their password, they can
   * initiate account recovery through this publicly accessible endpoint by
   * providing their registered email address. This is the first step in a
   * two-step password reset workflow.
   *
   * The password reset initiation process validates the submitted email address
   * exists in reddit_like_members table. If the email is not found, the system
   * still displays a generic success message ("If that email address is
   * registered, you will receive a password reset link") to prevent email
   * enumeration attacks where malicious actors could determine which email
   * addresses have accounts on the platform. This security practice protects
   * user privacy.
   *
   * For valid email addresses associated with active accounts, the system
   * generates a cryptographically secure random reset token using secure random
   * number generation per security requirements section 10. This unique token
   * serves as a time-limited authorization credential for password reset. The
   * system creates a new record in reddit_like_password_resets table containing
   * the user's ID (reddit_like_user_id foreign key), the submitted email
   * address for validation, the generated reset_token, and an expires_at
   * timestamp set to exactly 1 hour in the future per requirements.
   *
   * The system immediately sends a password reset email to the provided address
   * containing a unique reset link with the token embedded as a parameter
   * (e.g., https://platform.com/auth/member/password/reset?token=XXXXX). The
   * email explains the reset process, warns that the link expires in 1 hour,
   * and advises users to ignore the email if they didn't request the reset. The
   * email send operation occurs asynchronously to avoid blocking the API
   * response.
   *
   * Multiple password reset requests for the same account are allowed - each
   * generates a new token and sends a new email. Previous unused tokens remain
   * valid until their individual expiration times, though only the most recent
   * token is typically used. The used_at field in reddit_like_password_resets
   * remains null for all tokens until one is successfully used to reset the
   * password.
   *
   * Security considerations include rate limiting to prevent email spam abuse
   * (limiting reset requests per email address to reasonable frequency like 3
   * per hour), logging all reset requests for security monitoring, and ensuring
   * the reset token is sufficiently long and random to prevent guessing attacks
   * (recommended minimum 32 characters of cryptographically random data).
   *
   * The response provides generic confirmation without revealing whether the
   * email exists in the system, protecting user privacy while still being
   * helpful to legitimate users. After submitting, users should check their
   * email inbox (and spam folder) for the reset link within 5 minutes.
