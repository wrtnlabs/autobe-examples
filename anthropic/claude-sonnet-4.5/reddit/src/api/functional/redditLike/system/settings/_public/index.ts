/**
 * Retrieve all public platform-wide configuration settings that are safe to
 * expose to all users including unauthenticated guests. This operation queries
 * the reddit_like_system_settings table filtering for records where is_public
 * is true, ensuring that only non-sensitive configuration parameters are
 * returned.
 *
 * Public settings typically include user-facing platform parameters that help
 * clients understand system constraints and capabilities. Examples include
 * maximum content lengths (max_post_length, max_comment_length), file upload
 * limits (max_image_file_size), rate limiting thresholds visible to users
 * (posts_per_hour_limit), and feature toggles that affect user experience
 * (image_posts_enabled, comment_editing_window).
 *
 * The response provides settings organized by their category field for easier
 * consumption, allowing client applications to reference specific parameter
 * groups. Each setting includes the key identifier, the value as a string, the
 * value_type indicator for proper deserialization, and the description
 * explaining the setting's purpose.
 *
 * This endpoint supports the platform's transparency principle by making
 * operational parameters visible to all users without requiring authentication.
 * Security is maintained by the is_public flag preventing exposure of sensitive
 * internal settings like API keys, security parameters, or administrative
 * thresholds.
 *
 * Since this endpoint returns reference data that changes infrequently, client
 * applications may cache the response with appropriate cache invalidation
 * strategies. The settings returned represent current platform capabilities and
 * constraints that clients should respect when submitting content or making
 * requests.
