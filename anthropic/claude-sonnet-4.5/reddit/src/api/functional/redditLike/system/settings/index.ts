/**
 * Retrieve platform-wide configuration settings for public consumption.
 *
 * Retrieve the complete list of platform-wide configuration settings that
 * control various aspects of system behavior, feature availability, and
 * operational limits. This operation queries the reddit_like_system_settings
 * table, which stores all configurable parameters as key-value pairs with
 * metadata describing their purpose, type, and visibility.
 *
 * System settings encompass a wide range of platform controls including content
 * limits (maximum post length, comment length, image file size), rate limiting
 * rules (posts per hour, comments per minute, votes per minute), feature
 * toggles (enable/disable specific features), moderation thresholds, and other
 * runtime-configurable parameters. Each setting includes a unique key
 * identifier used throughout the application to retrieve the setting value, a
 * string-encoded value that may represent various data types, and a value_type
 * field indicating how to deserialize the value (string, int, double, boolean,
 * json).
 *
 * Settings are organized into categories such as 'content', 'moderation',
 * 'performance', and 'features' to facilitate logical grouping and filtering in
 * administrative interfaces. Each setting includes a human-readable description
 * explaining what it controls and its purpose, helping administrators
 * understand the impact of configuration changes. The is_public flag determines
 * whether a setting can be exposed via public API or should remain
 * internal-only for security and operational reasons.
 *
 * This operation returns only public settings (where is_public = true) to
 * prevent exposure of sensitive configuration like API keys, security
 * parameters, or internal system controls. Public settings inform client
 * applications about platform limits and capabilities, enabling dynamic
 * behavior configuration without hardcoding values. For example, clients can
 * query max_post_length to validate user input before submission, or check
 * feature toggle settings to conditionally display UI elements.
 *
 * The response includes all setting metadata: the setting key, current value,
 * description, value type for proper deserialization, category for
 * organization, and public visibility status. Settings are returned as a list
 * that can be transformed into a key-value map by client applications for
 * efficient lookup. The operation does not require authentication since it
 * exposes only public configuration data intended for general consumption.
 *
 * Internal settings restricted to administrators are accessed through separate
 * privileged endpoints not covered by this operation. This separation ensures
 * proper access control while maintaining transparency about public platform
 * parameters. The operation supports platform-wide consistency by providing a
 * single source of truth for configuration values that affect user experience
 * and platform behavior.
