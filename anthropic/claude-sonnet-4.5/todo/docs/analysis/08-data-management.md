# Data Management

## Data Management Overview

This document defines the business requirements for data management in the Todo list application. It establishes how data is created, maintained, protected, and controlled throughout its lifecycle, ensuring user privacy, data integrity, and reliable service operation.

The data management approach prioritizes:
- **Simplicity**: Clear, straightforward data handling aligned with minimal feature scope
- **User Control**: Users own their data and can export or delete it at will
- **Privacy**: Strict isolation between users' data
- **Reliability**: Data is protected against loss and corruption
- **Transparency**: Users understand what data is stored and how it's managed

This document focuses on **business requirements** for data management—what the system must do from a user and business perspective—without specifying technical implementation details such as database schemas, storage technologies, or architectural patterns.

> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**. All technical implementations (database design, storage architecture, backup mechanisms, etc.) are at the discretion of the development team.*

## Todo Data Lifecycle

### Todo Creation
**WHEN a user creates a new todo, THE system SHALL persist the todo data immediately and make it available for subsequent retrieval.**

**THE system SHALL capture the following information when a todo is created:**
- Todo title (user-provided text)
- Completion status (initially set to incomplete)
- Creation timestamp (system-generated)
- Owner information (the user who created it)

**THE system SHALL assign a unique identifier to each todo upon creation.**

**WHEN a todo is created, THE system SHALL associate it exclusively with the creating user's account.**

### Todo Updates and Modifications
**WHEN a user modifies a todo's title, THE system SHALL update the stored data immediately and reflect the change in all subsequent views.**

**WHEN a user changes a todo's completion status, THE system SHALL update the status immediately and persist the change.**

**THE system SHALL maintain the original creation timestamp when a todo is modified.**

**THE system SHALL optionally track the last modification timestamp for each todo.**

### Todo Completion Status Management
**THE system SHALL support two distinct completion states for todos: incomplete and complete.**

**WHEN a user marks a todo as complete, THE system SHALL persist this status change and display the todo as completed in all views.**

**WHEN a user marks a completed todo as incomplete, THE system SHALL persist this status change and display the todo as incomplete in all views.**

**THE system SHALL allow users to toggle completion status any number of times without data loss.**

### Todo Deletion
**WHEN a user deletes a todo, THE system SHALL remove the todo data permanently and immediately.**

**THE system SHALL NOT retain deleted todo data in user-accessible storage.**

**WHEN a todo is deleted, THE system SHALL remove all references to that todo to prevent orphaned data.**

**IF a user attempts to access a deleted todo, THEN THE system SHALL indicate that the todo no longer exists.**

### Data Persistence Requirements
**THE system SHALL persist all todo data reliably to prevent data loss during normal operation.**

**THE system SHALL ensure that committed todo operations (create, update, delete) are durable and survive system restarts.**

**WHEN a user creates or modifies a todo, THE system SHALL confirm the operation only after the data is successfully persisted.**

## User Data Lifecycle

### User Registration and Account Creation
**WHEN a user registers for an account, THE system SHALL capture and persist the following user data:**
- Email address (for authentication and identification)
- Password (securely stored, never in plain text)
- Account creation timestamp

**THE system SHALL assign a unique identifier to each user account upon registration.**

**THE system SHALL ensure that user account data is immediately available for authentication after successful registration.**

### User Profile Data Management
**THE system SHALL maintain user account information for the lifetime of the active account.**

**WHEN a user updates their email address, THE system SHALL update the stored email and continue to associate all existing todos with the updated account.**

**WHEN a user changes their password, THE system SHALL update the authentication credentials securely and immediately.**

### User Authentication Data Handling
**THE system SHALL store user authentication credentials securely to enable login verification.**

**THE system SHALL never expose user passwords in any user-facing interface or export.**

**THE system SHALL maintain user session data for the duration of active sessions and remove session data when sessions expire or users log out.**

**THE system SHALL persist user authentication tokens according to token expiration policies defined in the authentication requirements.**

### Account Modification Processes
**WHEN a user modifies account information, THE system SHALL update the stored data immediately and reflect changes in subsequent authentication attempts.**

**THE system SHALL maintain data integrity when account information is updated, ensuring all associated todos remain correctly linked to the user account.**

### Account Deletion and Data Removal
**WHEN a user requests account deletion, THE system SHALL remove all user account data including:**
- User profile information
- Authentication credentials
- All todos created by the user
- User session data

**THE system SHALL complete account deletion permanently and make the data irrecoverable from user-accessible storage.**

**WHEN an account is deleted, THE system SHALL allow the same email address to be registered again for a new account.**

**THE system SHALL confirm account deletion to the user before proceeding with permanent data removal.**

## Data Retention Policy

### Active User Data Retention
**THE system SHALL retain all todo data for active user accounts indefinitely until the user explicitly deletes the todos or the account.**

**THE system SHALL retain user account information for as long as the account remains active.**

**WHILE a user account is active, THE system SHALL NOT automatically delete any user data without explicit user action.**

### Deleted Data Handling
**WHEN a user deletes a todo, THE system SHALL remove the todo data immediately from user-accessible storage.**

**WHEN a user deletes their account, THE system SHALL remove all associated user and todo data immediately from user-accessible storage.**

**THE system SHALL NOT retain user-facing copies of deleted todos or accounts beyond what is necessary for immediate operational purposes.**

**IF backup systems retain deleted data temporarily, THE system SHALL ensure that deleted data is not restorable to user-accessible storage through normal application operations.**

### Inactive Account Policies
**THE system SHALL NOT automatically delete or deactivate user accounts based on inactivity for the minimal version of the application.**

**THE system SHALL allow users to return to their accounts after any period of inactivity and find their todo data intact.**

**Future versions MAY implement inactive account policies, but the initial minimal version SHALL retain all active accounts indefinitely.**

### Session and Temporary Data Retention
**THE system SHALL retain active user session data until the session expires or the user logs out.**

**WHEN a session expires, THE system SHALL remove session data promptly.**

**THE system SHALL NOT retain temporary authentication tokens beyond their defined expiration periods.**

## Data Privacy Requirements

### User Data Ownership
**THE system SHALL treat all user-created data (todos and account information) as belonging exclusively to the user who created it.**

**Users SHALL have full control over their own data, including the ability to view, modify, export, and delete it.**

**THE system SHALL NOT grant access to user data to any other users or third parties without explicit user consent.**

### Data Isolation Between Users
**THE system SHALL ensure complete isolation of todo data between different user accounts.**

**WHEN a user views their todo list, THE system SHALL display only todos created by that specific user.**

**THE system SHALL prevent any user from accessing, viewing, modifying, or deleting another user's todos under all circumstances.**

**THE system SHALL ensure that user account information is visible only to the account owner.**

### Privacy Protection Measures
**THE system SHALL NOT share user data with external parties in the minimal version of the application.**

**THE system SHALL store user data securely and protect it from unauthorized access.**

**THE system SHALL process user data only for the purposes of providing todo list functionality.**

**THE system SHALL NOT use user data for marketing, analytics, or any purpose beyond core todo management functionality in the minimal version.**

### Data Access Controls
**THE system SHALL require authentication before granting access to any user-specific data.**

**WHEN a user is authenticated, THE system SHALL grant access only to that user's own data.**

**THE system SHALL deny all data access requests from unauthenticated users except for registration and login operations.**

**THE system SHALL verify user identity and authorization before executing any data operation (create, read, update, delete).**

## Data Backup and Recovery Expectations

### Business Continuity Requirements
**THE system SHALL protect user data against loss due to system failures, crashes, or unexpected shutdowns.**

**WHEN system failures occur, THE system SHALL recover to a consistent state where user data remains intact.**

**THE system SHALL implement measures to prevent data corruption during normal operations and system failures.**

### Data Loss Prevention Expectations
**THE system SHALL minimize the risk of data loss for committed todo operations.**

**WHEN a user successfully creates or modifies a todo, THE system SHALL ensure that the data is protected against loss from typical failure scenarios.**

**Users SHOULD expect that confirmed todo operations (create, update, delete) are reliably persisted and will survive system restarts.**

### Recovery Point Objectives from User Perspective
**IF data recovery is necessary after system failure, THE system SHOULD restore user data to a point as close as possible to the time of failure.**

**Users SHOULD NOT lose confirmed todo operations due to system failures or crashes.**

**THE system SHALL communicate to users if any data recovery is required and what data, if any, could not be recovered.**

### System Reliability Expectations
**THE system SHALL maintain data reliability consistent with user expectations for a personal productivity application.**

**Users SHOULD be able to trust that their todo data will be available when they return to the application.**

**THE system SHALL implement reasonable measures to ensure data availability during normal operation.**

## Data Export Capabilities

### User's Right to Data Portability
**THE system SHALL provide users with the ability to export all of their todo data.**

**THE system SHALL provide users with the ability to export their account information (excluding sensitive authentication credentials).**

**WHEN a user requests a data export, THE system SHALL generate and provide the export within a reasonable timeframe (ideally immediately).**

### Export Format Requirements
**THE system SHALL export user data in a commonly readable format such as JSON or CSV.**

**THE exported data SHALL include all user-accessible information about each todo:**
- Todo title
- Completion status
- Creation timestamp
- Last modification timestamp (if tracked)

**THE exported user account data SHALL include:**
- Email address
- Account creation timestamp
- Any other non-sensitive profile information

**THE system SHALL NOT include user passwords or authentication tokens in data exports.**

### Export Scope and Content
**WHEN a user exports their data, THE system SHALL include all active (non-deleted) todos associated with their account.**

**THE system SHALL provide a complete export of the user's current data state at the time of the export request.**

**THE system SHALL structure exported data in a clear, organized manner that allows users to understand and use their data outside the application.**

**THE export format SHOULD be compatible with common spreadsheet applications or data processing tools for user convenience.**

### Export Access and Availability
**THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to export their own data at any time.**

**THE system SHALL NOT require special permissions or administrative approval for users to export their own data.**

**THE system SHALL deliver the data export directly to the user through the application interface or via email to their registered email address.**

## Data Management Principles Summary

The Todo list application's data management approach emphasizes:

1. **User Empowerment**: Users fully control their data with rights to access, modify, export, and delete
2. **Privacy by Design**: Complete isolation between users' data with no cross-user access
3. **Simplicity**: Straightforward data lifecycle without complex archival or versioning
4. **Reliability**: Protection against data loss with appropriate backup and recovery measures
