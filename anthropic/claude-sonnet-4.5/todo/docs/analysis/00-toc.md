# Todo List Application - Requirements Analysis Documentation

## Document Overview

This requirements analysis provides comprehensive documentation for a minimal, focused Todo List application. The documentation follows a structured approach to define business requirements, user needs, and system behavior from a non-technical perspective, enabling backend developers to understand exactly what needs to be built without prescribing technical implementation details.

The documentation set consists of 11 interconnected documents, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Todo List application. These documents are designed to be read sequentially for complete understanding, though individual documents can be referenced independently as needed.

## Project Summary

### Application Vision

The Todo List Application is designed with a core philosophy: **simplicity and essential functionality**. This is not a feature-rich task management platform with complex workflows, team collaboration, or advanced planning tools. Instead, it is a clean, straightforward personal todo list that allows individual users to capture, track, and complete their tasks efficiently.

### Core Principles

- **Minimalism**: Only essential features that directly support basic todo management
- **User Focus**: Single-user experience with personal todo lists
- **Simplicity**: Intuitive operations without complex configurations or settings
- **Clarity**: Clear, unambiguous requirements that developers can implement confidently

### Scope Boundaries

**What This Application IS:**
- A personal todo list manager
- A simple task tracking system
- A tool for individual productivity

**What This Application IS NOT:**
- A team collaboration platform
- A project management system
- A complex workflow automation tool
- A feature-rich enterprise task manager

- **Unwanted behavior**: "IF condition, THEN THE system SHALL function."
- **Optional features**: "WHERE feature, THE system SHALL function."

### Visual Diagrams
