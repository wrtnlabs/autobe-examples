# Security and Compliance Requirements

## Security Overview

### Security Philosophy

This Todo list application follows a **security-first approach** while maintaining simplicity. Even though the application has minimal features, user data protection and privacy are paramount. The security model is designed to:

- **Protect user credentials and personal information** from unauthorized access
- **Ensure data privacy** so users can only access their own todos
- **Prevent common web security vulnerabilities** through industry-standard practices
- **Maintain transparency** about data collection and usage
- **Balance security with usability** to provide a safe yet simple user experience

### Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls protect user data
2. **Least Privilege**: Users and systems have only the minimum access necessary
3. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations are built into every feature
4. **Security by Default**: Secure configurations are the default state
5. **Transparency**: Users understand what data is collected and how it's used

### Scope of Security Measures

The security requirements cover:
- User authentication and session management
- Data protection during storage and transmission
- Access control and authorization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Privacy and compliance with data protection principles
