# Performance Requirements

## Performance Philosophy

The Todo list application is designed with simplicity and responsiveness at its core. Performance requirements focus on delivering an instant, seamless user experience that makes todo management feel effortless. Users should never wait or wonder if the system is working—every interaction should provide immediate feedback and completion.

### Core Performance Principles

**Instant Gratification**: Users expect todo management to be as fast as writing on paper. The system should respond so quickly that users don't perceive any delay between their action and the system's response.

**Predictable Performance**: System performance should remain consistent regardless of the time of day, number of todos, or concurrent users. Users should experience the same fast response whether they have 5 todos or 500 todos.

**Graceful Scaling**: As users accumulate more todos over time, the system should maintain its responsiveness without degradation in performance.

**User-Centric Metrics**: Performance is measured from the user's perspective, not just server response times. The complete user experience—from clicking a button to seeing the result—must feel instant.

## Response Time Requirements

All response time requirements are defined from the moment a user initiates an action (clicking a button, submitting a form) to the moment they receive complete visual feedback.

### Critical Operations (Must Feel Instant)

**WHEN a user creates a new todo, THE system SHALL complete the operation and display the new todo within 500 milliseconds.**

**WHEN a user marks a todo as complete or incomplete, THE system SHALL update the status and display the change within 300 milliseconds.**

**WHEN a user deletes a todo, THE system SHALL remove the todo from display within 500 milliseconds.**

**WHEN a user views their todo list, THE system SHALL display all todos within 1 second.**

### Authentication Operations

**WHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL validate and respond within 2 seconds.**

**WHEN a user submits registration information, THE system SHALL create the account and respond within 3 seconds.**

**WHEN a user's session is validated on page load, THE system SHALL complete authentication check within 1 second.**

### Data Modification Operations

**WHEN a user edits a todo title or description, THE system SHALL save changes and confirm within 500 milliseconds.**

**WHEN a user requests their complete todo list after login, THE system SHALL retrieve and display all todos within 1.5 seconds.**

## User Experience Performance Standards

### Perceived Performance

**THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions within 100 milliseconds**, even if the actual operation takes longer to complete.

**WHEN the system is processing an operation that exceeds 200 milliseconds, THE system SHALL display a loading indicator to inform the user.**

**THE system SHALL display optimistic updates for todo status changes**, showing the change immediately while processing in the background.

### Response Consistency

**THE system SHALL maintain consistent response times regardless of the number of todos a user has**, up to 1,000 todos per user.

**WHILE the system has fewer than 100 concurrent users, THE system SHALL maintain all response time requirements without degradation.**

**THE system SHALL respond to user requests within the specified time limits 99% of the time under normal operating conditions.**

## Operation-Specific Performance Requirements

### Todo Creation Performance

**WHEN a user submits a new todo with a title only, THE system SHALL create and return the todo within 400 milliseconds.**

**WHEN a user submits a new todo with both title and description, THE system SHALL create and return the todo within 500 milliseconds.**

**THE system SHALL validate todo input fields and return validation errors within 200 milliseconds.**

### Todo Retrieval Performance

**WHEN a user has fewer than 100 todos, THE system SHALL retrieve and display the complete list within 500 milliseconds.**

**WHEN a user has between 100 and 500 todos, THE system SHALL retrieve and display the complete list within 1 second.**

**WHEN a user has between 500 and 1,000 todos, THE system SHALL retrieve and display the complete list within 1.5 seconds.**

**THE system SHALL retrieve individual todo details within 300 milliseconds.**

### Todo Update Performance

**WHEN a user updates a todo's title, THE system SHALL save and confirm the change within 400 milliseconds.**

**WHEN a user updates a todo's description, THE system SHALL save and confirm the change within 500 milliseconds.**

**WHEN a user toggles a todo's completion status, THE system SHALL update and confirm within 300 milliseconds.**

**THE system SHALL validate updated todo data and return validation errors within 200 milliseconds.**

### Todo Deletion Performance

**WHEN a user deletes a single todo, THE system SHALL process the deletion and confirm within 400 milliseconds.**

**WHEN a user deletes multiple todos in sequence, THE system SHALL process each deletion within 400 milliseconds per todo.**

## Scalability Expectations

### User Concurrency

**WHILE the system supports up to 50 concurrent users, THE system SHALL maintain all specified response time requirements.**

**WHILE the system supports between 50 and 100 concurrent users, THE system SHALL maintain response times within 150% of specified requirements.**

**THE system SHALL handle 100 concurrent users performing todo operations without failing or returning errors.**

### Individual User Scale

**THE system SHALL support individual users with up to 1,000 todos without performance degradation beyond specified limits.**

**WHEN a user has more than 1,000 todos, THE system SHALL continue to function correctly**, though response times may exceed specified limits.

**THE system SHALL support users creating up to 50 new todos per day without performance issues.**

### Peak Load Handling

**WHEN the system experiences peak usage during business hours, THE system SHALL maintain response time requirements for 95% of requests.**

**IF the system experiences unusually high load exceeding 150 concurrent users, THEN THE system SHALL continue to function correctly** but may experience slower response times.

**THE system SHALL recover to normal performance within 30 seconds after peak load subsides.**

## Data Load Performance

### Initial Data Loading

**WHEN a user first logs in, THE system SHALL load their todo list dashboard within 2 seconds**, including authentication and initial data retrieval.

**WHEN a user navigates to the todo list view, THE system SHALL display todos within 1 second.**

**THE system SHALL load user profile information within 500 milliseconds.**

### Progressive Data Loading

**WHILE a user has more than 100 todos, THE system SHALL display the first 50 todos within 1 second**, with additional todos loading progressively.

**THE system SHALL support smooth scrolling through large todo lists without freezing or lag.**

**WHEN additional todos are loaded during scrolling, THE system SHALL fetch and display the next batch within 500 milliseconds.**

### Data Synchronization

**WHEN todo data is modified, THE system SHALL ensure data consistency across all user sessions within 5 seconds.**

**WHEN a user refreshes their browser, THE system SHALL display current todo data within 1 second.**

## Performance Monitoring Expectations

### System Health Monitoring

**THE system SHALL track response times for all critical operations continuously.**

**THE system SHALL identify when response times exceed specified requirements and log these events.**

**THE system SHALL monitor system resource utilization to prevent performance degradation.**

### Performance Degradation Detection

**IF average response times exceed 150% of requirements for more than 5 minutes, THEN THE system SHALL generate an alert.**

**IF any critical operation fails to respond within 10 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL log this as a critical performance failure.**

**THE system SHALL track the percentage of requests meeting performance requirements** and maintain visibility of this metric.

### User Experience Monitoring
