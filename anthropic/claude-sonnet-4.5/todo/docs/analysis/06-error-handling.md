# Error Handling Specification

## Error Handling Philosophy

The Todo list application prioritizes user-friendly error handling that helps users understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Every error scenario must provide clear, actionable feedback without exposing technical implementation details or security-sensitive information.

### Core Principles

**Clarity Over Technical Precision**: Error messages should be written in plain language that non-technical users can understand. Technical details should be logged for developers but not displayed to users.

**Actionable Guidance**: Every error message must guide users toward resolution. Instead of simply stating what failed, messages should suggest what the user can do next.

**Consistency**: All errors follow the same response format and communication style, creating a predictable and trustworthy user experience.

**Security-Conscious**: Error messages never reveal sensitive information such as whether an email exists in the system, internal system architecture, or database details.

**Graceful Degradation**: When errors occur, the system maintains data integrity and user state, ensuring users don't lose their work or context.

## Error Response Format

THE system SHALL return all errors using a consistent JSON structure with the following properties:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "User-friendly error message",
    "field": "fieldName"
  }
}
```

### Error Response Properties

**success**: THE error response SHALL always include a "success" property set to false.

**error.code**: THE system SHALL provide a unique error code identifying the specific error type in uppercase snake_case format.

**error.message**: THE system SHALL provide a user-friendly message in plain language explaining the error and suggesting resolution steps.

**error.field**: WHEN an error relates to a specific input field, THE system SHALL include the field name to help users identify where the problem occurred.

### HTTP Status Code Usage

THE system SHALL use appropriate HTTP status codes for different error categories:

- **400 Bad Request**: WHEN user input fails validation or business rules
- **401 Unauthorized**: WHEN authentication is required but not provided or invalid
- **403 Forbidden**: WHEN an authenticated user attempts an unauthorized action
- **404 Not Found**: WHEN a requested resource does not exist
- **409 Conflict**: WHEN the request conflicts with existing data
- **429 Too Many Requests**: WHEN rate limiting is triggered
- **500 Internal Server Error**: WHEN unexpected system errors occur

## Authentication Errors

### Registration Errors

**Duplicate Email Address**

WHEN a user attempts to register with an email address that already exists in the system, THE system SHALL return HTTP 409 with error code "EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS" and message "This email address is already registered. Please log in or use a different email."

**Invalid Email Format**

WHEN a user provides an email that doesn't match standard email format, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "INVALID_EMAIL_FORMAT" and message "Please enter a valid email address (e.g., user@example.com)."

**Weak Password**

WHEN a user provides a password that doesn't meet minimum security requirements, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "WEAK_PASSWORD" and message "Password must be at least 8 characters long and include letters and numbers."

**Missing Required Registration Fields**

WHEN a user submits registration without required fields (email or password), THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD" and message "Email and password are required to create an account." and field property indicating which field is missing.

**Empty Password**

WHEN a user submits registration with an empty password field, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "PASSWORD_REQUIRED" and message "Please enter a password to secure your account."

### Login Errors

**Invalid Credentials**

WHEN a user provides incorrect email or password during login, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code "INVALID_CREDENTIALS" and message "The email or password you entered is incorrect. Please try again."

**Missing Login Fields**

WHEN a user attempts to log in without providing email or password, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "MISSING_CREDENTIALS" and message "Please enter both email and password to log in."

**Account Not Found**

WHEN a user attempts to log in with an email that doesn't exist, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code "INVALID_CREDENTIALS" and message "The email or password you entered is incorrect. Please try again."

> Note: The same error message is used for both "account not found" and "wrong password" to prevent email enumeration attacks.

### Session and Token Errors

**Expired Session**

WHEN a user's JWT access token has expired, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code "SESSION_EXPIRED" and message "Your session has expired. Please log in again to continue."

**Invalid Token**

WHEN a user provides a malformed or invalid JWT token, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code "INVALID_TOKEN" and message "Authentication failed. Please log in again."

**Missing Token**

WHEN a user attempts to access a protected endpoint without providing a JWT token, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code "AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED" and message "Please log in to access this feature."

**Token Verification Failed**

WHEN JWT token signature verification fails, THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code "INVALID_TOKEN" and message "Authentication failed. Please log in again."

### Recovery Process for Authentication Errors

**For Registration Errors**:
1. User receives clear error message indicating the specific problem
2. User corrects the invalid field (highlighted by the "field" property)
3. User resubmits registration form
4. IF successful, user is directed to login or automatically logged in

**For Login Errors**:
1. User receives error message about invalid credentials
2. User verifies email and password are correct
3. User retries login
4. IF multiple failures occur, user may need to register if they don't have an account

**For Session Errors**:
1. User receives notification that session expired
2. System redirects user to login page
3. User logs in again
4. System redirects user back to their previous activity when possible

## Todo Operation Errors

## Validation Errors

### General Validation Errors

**Missing Required Fields**

WHEN a request is missing required fields, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD" and message "The following required field is missing: [field_name]" and field property indicating the missing field.

**Invalid Data Type**

WHEN a request provides a field with the wrong data type, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "INVALID_DATA_TYPE" and message "The field [field_name] has an invalid format. Expected [expected_type]."

**Request Body Too Large**

WHEN a request body exceeds maximum allowed size, THE system SHALL return HTTP 413 with error code "REQUEST_TOO_LARGE" and message "The request is too large. Please reduce the amount of data and try again."

**Malformed JSON**

WHEN a request contains invalid JSON syntax, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "INVALID_JSON" and message "The request data is malformed. Please check your input and try again."

### Email Validation

**Invalid Email Characters**

WHEN an email contains invalid characters or format, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "INVALID_EMAIL_FORMAT" and message "Please enter a valid email address. Example: user@example.com"

**Email Too Long**

WHEN an email exceeds 255 characters, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "EMAIL_TOO_LONG" and message "Email address must be 255 characters or less."

### Password Validation

**Password Too Short**

WHEN a password is less than 8 characters, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "PASSWORD_TOO_SHORT" and message "Password must be at least 8 characters long."

**Password Too Long**

WHEN a password exceeds 100 characters, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "PASSWORD_TOO_LONG" and message "Password must be 100 characters or less."

**Password Missing Required Characters**

WHEN a password doesn't contain both letters and numbers, THE system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error code "PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_REQUIRED" and message "Password must include both letters and numbers for security."

### Recovery Process for Validation Errors

**Validation Error Recovery Flow**:
1. User receives specific validation error with field name and requirement
2. System highlights or indicates the problematic field (via "field" property)
3. User corrects the specific field based on error guidance
4. User resubmits the form or request
5. IF all validation passes, request succeeds
6. IF additional validation errors exist, process repeats

**User Guidance for Common Validation Issues**:
- **Too long**: Error message includes current length and maximum allowed
- **Missing field**: Error clearly states which field is required
- **Wrong format**: Error provides example of correct format
- **Invalid characters**: Error explains what characters are allowed

## System Errors

### Server-Side Errors

**Internal Server Error**

WHEN an unexpected error occurs in the system, THE system SHALL return HTTP 500 with error code "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR" and message "Something went wrong on our end. Please try again in a moment. If the problem persists, contact support."

**Database Query Error**

WHEN a database operation fails unexpectedly, THE system SHALL return HTTP 500 with error code "DATABASE_ERROR" and message "We encountered an issue processing your request. Please try again."

**Service Timeout**

WHEN a request times out before completion, THE system SHALL return HTTP 504 with error code "REQUEST_TIMEOUT" and message "The request took too long to process. Please try again."

### Rate Limiting Errors

**Too Many Requests**

WHEN a user exceeds the rate limit for API requests, THE system SHALL return HTTP 429 with error code "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED" and message "You're making too many requests. Please wait [X] seconds before trying again."

**Too Many Failed Login Attempts**

WHEN a user exceeds the maximum number of failed login attempts, THE system SHALL return HTTP 429 with error code "TOO_MANY_FAILED_ATTEMPTS" and message "Too many failed login attempts. Please wait 15 minutes before trying again."

### Service Availability Errors

**Service Under Maintenance**

WHEN the system is under maintenance, THE system SHALL return HTTP 503 with error code "MAINTENANCE_MODE" and message "The service is currently under maintenance. We'll be back shortly. Thank you for your patience."

**Feature Temporarily Disabled**

WHEN a specific feature is temporarily disabled, THE system SHALL return HTTP 503 with error code "FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE" and message "This feature is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."

### Recovery Process for System Errors

**For Temporary System Errors**:
1. User receives error message indicating temporary issue
2. System suggests waiting a specific amount of time
3. User waits and retries the operation
4. IF error persists, user is advised to contact support

**For Rate Limiting**:
1. User receives message about request limits
2. System provides specific wait time
3. User waits the specified duration
4. User can resume normal operations after wait period

**For Maintenance**:
1. User is informed about maintenance status
2. User receives estimated completion time (if available)
3. User can check back later
4. System automatically restores service when maintenance completes

## Error Logging and Monitoring

### Error Logging Requirements

**Server-Side Logging**

WHEN any error occurs, THE system SHALL log the following information for debugging and monitoring:
- Timestamp of the error
- Error type and code
- User ID (if authenticated)
- Request endpoint and method
- Full error stack trace
- Request parameters (excluding sensitive data)

**Sensitive Data Exclusion**

THE system SHALL NOT log the following sensitive information:
- User passwords (plain or hashed)
- JWT tokens
- Authentication credentials
- Personal identifiable information beyond user ID

**Log Retention**

THE system SHALL retain error logs for at least 30 days for analysis and debugging purposes.

### Error Monitoring

**Critical Error Alerts**

WHEN critical errors occur (500 errors, database failures), THE system SHALL trigger alerts for immediate investigation.

**Error Rate Monitoring**

THE system SHALL monitor error rates and alert when error rates exceed normal thresholds, indicating potential system issues.

## User Communication Guidelines

### Error Message Writing Standards

**Clear and Concise**

Error messages SHALL be written in simple, clear language avoiding technical jargon. Maximum message length should be 150 characters for primary error message.

**Actionable**

Every error message SHOULD include what the user can do to resolve the issue. Use phrases like:
- "Please [action]..."
- "Try [suggestion]..."
- "Make sure [requirement]..."

**Polite and Reassuring**

Error messages SHALL maintain a friendly, helpful tone. Avoid blame or harsh language. Examples:
- ✅ "Please enter a valid email address"
- ❌ "Invalid email - you made a mistake"

**Specific Over Generic**

Error messages SHALL be specific about what went wrong rather than generic statements. Examples:
- ✅ "Todo title must be 200 characters or less"
- ❌ "Invalid input"

### Security-Conscious Messaging

**No Information Leakage**

Error messages SHALL NOT reveal:
- Whether an email exists in the system (use same message for multiple scenarios)
- Internal system architecture or technology stack
- Database structure or field names
- File paths or server information

**Example of Security-Conscious Messaging**:
- Instead of "User with email user@example.com not found in database"
- Use: "The email or password you entered is incorrect"

## Error Prevention Strategies

### Input Validation on Client Side

WHILE users are entering data, THE system SHOULD provide real-time feedback about:
- Field length limits with character counters
- Format requirements with examples
- Required field indicators

**Note**: Client-side validation is a user experience enhancement, not a security measure. Server-side validation is mandatory.

### Progressive Disclosure

WHEN users encounter complex forms, THE system SHOULD guide them through step-by-step to prevent errors before they occur.

### Clear Requirements

THE system SHALL display clear requirements before users submit data:
- Password requirements shown on registration form
- Field length limits indicated near input fields
- Required fields clearly marked

## Testing Error Scenarios

### Error Handling Test Requirements

Backend developers SHALL test all error scenarios to ensure:

1. **Correct HTTP status codes** are returned for each error type
2. **Error response format** is consistent across all endpoints
3. **Error messages** are user-friendly and don't expose sensitive information
4. **Field property** is included when errors relate to specific fields
5. **Logging** captures all necessary debugging information without sensitive data
6. **Recovery flows** work as specified for each error type

### Critical Error Scenarios to Test

- User attempts to create todo without authentication
- User attempts to access another user's todo
- User provides invalid data for all fields
- User exceeds rate limits
- Database connection failures
- Token expiration during active session
- Concurrent requests causing conflicts
- All validation edge cases (empty, too long, wrong format)

## Conclusion

This error handling specification ensures that the Todo list application provides a consistent, user-friendly experience even when things go wrong. Every error scenario has been identified with specific error codes, appropriate HTTP status codes, clear user messages, and recovery processes.

Backend developers must implement all error scenarios exactly as specified, ensuring that:

- All errors return the consistent JSON format
- Error messages are helpful and security-conscious
- Users always have a clear path to recover from errors
- Error logs provide sufficient information for debugging
- The system fails gracefully without exposing sensitive information
