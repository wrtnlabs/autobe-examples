/**
 * Register a new user account in the todo_list_users table.
 *
 * Register a new user account to enable access to the Todo list application.
 * This operation creates a new record in the todo_list_users table with the
 * provided email and password credentials.
 *
 * The registration process validates that the email address follows standard
 * email format, is unique across all existing users, and does not exceed 255
 * characters. The password must meet minimum security requirements: at least 8
 * characters in length, containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase
 * letter, and one number. The system rejects commonly used weak passwords to
 * ensure account security.
 *
 * Upon successful validation, the password is securely hashed using bcrypt with
 * a minimum cost factor of 10 before storage. The system never stores passwords
 * in plain text. The email address is normalized to lowercase to enable
 * case-insensitive comparison and prevent duplicate accounts with different
 * casing.
 *
 * The created user account is immediately available for authentication. The
 * system generates timestamps for created_at and updated_at fields, both set to
 * the current time. The deleted_at field is set to null, indicating an active
 * account. A unique UUID is assigned as the primary key identifier.
 *
 * This operation is accessible to unauthenticated guest users, as it is the
 * mechanism by which new users gain access to the system. No authentication
 * token is required to call this endpoint. After successful registration, users
 * should proceed to the login endpoint to obtain authentication tokens for
 * accessing protected todo management features.

/**
 * Authenticate user credentials and issue JWT tokens for session management.
 *
 * Authenticate a registered user and establish a session by issuing JWT access
 * and refresh tokens. This operation validates user credentials against the
 * todo_list_users table and creates session tokens for subsequent authenticated
 * requests.
 *
 * The authentication process begins by validating that both email and password
 * fields are provided. The system looks up the user account by email address
 * (case-insensitive comparison) in the todo_list_users table. If no account
 * exists with the provided email, the operation returns a generic error message
 * to prevent email enumeration attacks.
 *
 * For existing accounts, the system verifies the provided password against the
 * stored password_hash using bcrypt comparison. If the password does not match,
 * the operation returns the same generic error message as for non-existent
 * accounts: "Invalid email or password." This security measure prevents
 * attackers from determining whether an email address is registered in the
 * system.
 *
 * The system implements brute force protection by tracking failed login
 * attempts per user account. After 5 consecutive failed attempts, the account
 * is temporarily locked for 15 minutes. During this lockout period, all login
 * attempts for that account return an HTTP 429 error with the message "Too many
 * login attempts. Please wait 15 minutes before trying again."
 *
 * Upon successful authentication, the system generates two JWT tokens: an
 * access token with 30-minute expiration and a refresh token with 30-day
 * expiration. The access token payload includes userId, email, role (set to
 * "user"), and issued-at timestamp. The refresh token payload includes userId,
 * tokenType (set to "refresh"), and issued-at timestamp. Both tokens are signed
 * using HS256 algorithm with a secure secret key stored in environment
 * configuration.
 *
 * The refresh token is hashed and stored in the todo_list_refresh_tokens table
 * with the user reference, expiration timestamp, and creation timestamp. The
 * revoked_at field is set to null, indicating an active token. This enables
 * server-side token validation and revocation capabilities for logout and
 * password change operations.
 *
 * The operation updates the user's last login timestamp and resets the failed
 * login attempt counter. The system logs all login attempts (successful and
 * failed) with timestamp, IP address, and user agent for security monitoring
 * purposes.
 *
 * This operation is accessible to unauthenticated guest users, as
 * authentication is the purpose of the endpoint. No prior authentication token
 * is required. The returned tokens must be included in subsequent requests to
 * protected endpoints for authorization.
