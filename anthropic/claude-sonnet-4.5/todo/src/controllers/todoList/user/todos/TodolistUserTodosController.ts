   * Create a new todo item for the authenticated user.
   *
   * Create a new todo item and add it to the authenticated user's personal todo
   * list. This operation is the primary method for users to capture and record
   * new tasks they need to complete.
   *
   * The operation accepts a todo title (required) and an optional description
   * in the request body. The title must be between 1 and 200 characters and
   * contain at least one non-whitespace character as per business validation
   * rules defined in the requirements. The description is optional but if
   * provided must not exceed 2000 characters.
   *
   * When a todo is successfully created, the system automatically performs
   * several operations: generates a unique UUID identifier for the todo,
   * assigns the currently authenticated user (extracted from the JWT token) as
   * the owner by setting the todo_list_user_id field, sets the completion
   * status to false (incomplete) by default, and records both the creation
   * timestamp and initial update timestamp with the current date and time.
   *
   * The operation enforces strict ownership and data isolation. Each todo is
   * exclusively associated with the user who created it, and the
   * todo_list_user_id field in the todo_list_todos table maintains this
   * relationship through a foreign key reference to todo_list_users.id. The
   * relationship is configured with CASCADE delete, meaning if a user account
   * is deleted, all their todos are automatically removed to maintain
   * referential integrity.
   *
   * Validation occurs before todo creation. If the title is empty, contains
   * only whitespace, or exceeds 200 characters, the system rejects the request
   * with a 400 Bad Request error and returns a clear validation error message.
   * Similarly, if the description exceeds 2000 characters, the request is
   * rejected with appropriate error feedback.
   *
   * Security measures include requiring valid JWT authentication before
   * processing the request (users must be logged in), extracting the user ID
   * from the validated JWT token payload to ensure correct ownership
   * assignment, and preventing unauthenticated guests from creating todos
   * (returns 401 Unauthorized).
   *
   * Performance expectations require the operation to complete within 500
   * milliseconds from request receipt to response delivery as defined in the
   * performance requirements document. The system provides immediate feedback
   * by returning the complete newly created todo object including the
   * system-generated ID and timestamps.
   *
   * This operation is fundamental to the user workflow. After successful
   * registration or login, creating the first todo is typically the user's
   * initial interaction with the core functionality. The operation is designed
   * to be fast and simple, allowing users to quickly capture tasks as they
   * arise throughout their day without friction or complexity.

  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated list of user's todos from
   * todo_list_todos table.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of todo items belonging to the
   * authenticated user. This operation provides advanced search and filtering
   * capabilities for the user's personal todo list, operating on the
   * todo_list_todos table with strict user isolation.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive filtering and search functionality to
   * help users find specific todos or view subsets of their task list. Users
   * can filter by completion status to view only incomplete or completed tasks,
   * search within todo titles and descriptions using text matching, and sort
   * results by various fields including creation date, update date, title, or
   * completion status. Pagination enables efficient handling of large todo
   * lists, returning results in manageable pages.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict enforcement of data isolation - the
   * system automatically filters todos to include only those where
   * todo_list_user_id matches the authenticated user's ID from the JWT token.
   * Users cannot access or search todos belonging to other users under any
   * circumstances. Rate limiting prevents abuse of search operations, and all
   * query parameters are validated to prevent injection attacks.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the todo_list_todos table as defined in the
   * Prisma schema, utilizing indexes on todo_list_user_id, created_at,
   * completed, and deleted_at fields for optimal query performance. The
   * operation excludes soft-deleted todos by filtering where deleted_at is
   * null, ensuring users only see their active todo items.
   *
   * The response includes todo summary information optimized for list displays:
   * id, title, description, completion status, creation timestamp, and last
   * update timestamp. Each response also includes pagination metadata showing
   * total count, current page, page size, and total pages to support
   * client-side pagination controls.
   *
   * Validation rules ensure search parameters are within acceptable ranges:
   * page numbers must be positive integers, page size is limited to prevent
   * excessive data retrieval (typically 50-100 items per page), sort fields
   * must be valid todo properties, and search text length is constrained to
   * prevent performance issues. The system provides clear error messages when
   * validation fails.
   *
   * Expected behavior: Successful requests return a paginated list of todos
   * matching the search criteria, sorted according to the specified order
   * (defaulting to newest first by created_at). Empty result sets return
   * successfully with an empty data array and pagination metadata. Invalid
   * search parameters return validation errors with specific guidance on
   * correcting the request.

  /**

   *
   * Update an existing todo item in the user's personal task list. This
   * operation allows authenticated users to modify the title, description, and
   * completion status of their own todo items. The operation enforces strict
   * ownership verification - users can only update todos they created, ensuring
   * complete data isolation between different user accounts.
   *
   * The update process validates all input data according to business rules
   * defined in the requirements. The title must be between 1 and 200 characters
   * and contain at least one non-whitespace character. The description, when
   * provided, must not exceed 2000 characters. The completion status must be a

   *
   * When a todo is successfully updated, the system automatically updates the
   * updated_at timestamp to record when the modification occurred. The original
   * creation timestamp (created_at) remains unchanged, preserving the
   * historical record of when the todo was first created. This operation
   * supports partial updates - only the fields included in the request body
   * will be modified, while other fields retain their existing values.
   *
   * The operation returns the complete updated todo item upon success,
   * including all current field values and system-generated timestamps. If the

  /**
   * Delete a todo item from the user's task list.
   *
   * Delete a todo item from the authenticated user's personal task list. This
   * operation allows users to remove todos they no longer need, whether
   * completed tasks they want to clear from their list or tasks that have
   * become obsolete or irrelevant. The operation implements soft delete
   * functionality by setting the deleted_at timestamp on the todo record,
   * marking it as deleted while preserving the data in the database for
   * referential integrity and potential recovery processes.
   *
   * The deletion process enforces strict ownership verification - users can
   * only delete todos they created. The system validates that the specified
   * todo exists and belongs to the authenticated user before proceeding with
   * deletion. If the todo does not exist or belongs to another user, the
   * operation returns an appropriate error response denying the deletion
   * request.
   *
   * As per the Prisma schema, this table includes a deleted_at field,
   * indicating soft delete implementation. When a todo is deleted, the system
   * sets the deleted_at timestamp to the current date and time, marking the
   * todo as deleted. The todo is then excluded from normal query results and
   * user views, effectively removing it from the user's active todo list.
   * However, the data remains in the database to support data lifecycle
   * management and maintain referential integrity.
   *
   * The operation returns a success confirmation when the deletion completes
   * successfully. Deleted todos are immediately removed from the user's todo
   * list view and cannot be accessed through normal todo retrieval operations.
   * Users should be aware that deletion is permanent from their perspective -
   * once deleted, todos cannot be easily recovered through the user interface
   * (though the data is retained in the database with the deleted_at
   * timestamp).
   *
   * This delete operation is essential for maintaining a clean, manageable todo
   * list. It enables users to remove completed tasks to reduce clutter,
   * eliminate outdated or cancelled tasks, and keep their task list focused on
   * current, actionable items. The soft delete approach supports data
   * management requirements while providing a clean user experience where
   * deleted items disappear from view immediately.
