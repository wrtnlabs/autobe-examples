  /**
   * Verify user email address with verification token.
   *
   * This operation completes the user registration process by verifying the
   * email address provided during account creation. When users register for a
   * new account, the system sends a verification email containing a unique,
   * time-limited token. This operation validates that token and activates the
   * user account.
   *
   * The verification process checks the provided token against stored
   * verification data, ensuring the token is valid, has not expired (24-hour
   * expiration as per authentication requirements), and has not been previously
   * used. The token is typically stored in a secure, hashed form similar to
   * password storage practices.
   *
   * Upon successful verification, the system updates the user account status in
   * the todo_list_users table to mark the email as verified. This typically
   * involves setting a verification timestamp or boolean flag that indicates
   * the account is fully activated. The user is then permitted to log in and
   * access the todo list application.
   *
   * If the verification token is expired, the system provides an appropriate
   * error message and may offer the option to request a new verification email.
   * Invalid tokens (malformed, already used, or non-existent) result in clear
   * error responses that guide users toward resolution.
   *
   * Security considerations include single-use token enforcement (tokens cannot
   * be reused after successful verification), time-based expiration (24 hours
   * from issuance), and secure token generation using cryptographically strong
   * random values. The operation prevents email enumeration by not revealing
   * whether an email exists in the system through error messages.
   *
   * This operation is essential for account security, ensuring that users have
   * access to the email addresses they register with. It prevents account
   * creation with invalid or unowned email addresses, which is critical for
   * password recovery and account security notifications.
   *
   * Related operations include user registration (which triggers verification
   * email sending) and resend verification email (for cases where the original
   * email was not received or the token expired).
