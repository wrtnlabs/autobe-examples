   * Register a new user account in the todo_list_users table.
   *
   * Register a new user account to enable access to the Todo list application.
   * This operation creates a new record in the todo_list_users table with the
   * provided email and password credentials.
   *
   * The registration process validates that the email address follows standard
   * email format, is unique across all existing users, and does not exceed 255
   * characters. The password must meet minimum security requirements: at least
   * 8 characters in length, containing at least one uppercase letter, one
   * lowercase letter, and one number. The system rejects commonly used weak
   * passwords to ensure account security.
   *
   * Upon successful validation, the password is securely hashed using bcrypt
   * with a minimum cost factor of 10 before storage. The system never stores
   * passwords in plain text. The email address is normalized to lowercase to
   * enable case-insensitive comparison and prevent duplicate accounts with
   * different casing.
   *
   * The created user account is immediately available for authentication. The
   * system generates timestamps for created_at and updated_at fields, both set
   * to the current time. The deleted_at field is set to null, indicating an
   * active account. A unique UUID is assigned as the primary key identifier.
   *
   * This operation is accessible to unauthenticated guest users, as it is the
   * mechanism by which new users gain access to the system. No authentication
   * token is required to call this endpoint. After successful registration,
   * users should proceed to the login endpoint to obtain authentication tokens
   * for accessing protected todo management features.

  /**
   * Authenticate user credentials and issue JWT tokens for session management.
   *
   * Authenticate a registered user and establish a session by issuing JWT
   * access and refresh tokens. This operation validates user credentials
   * against the todo_list_users table and creates session tokens for subsequent
   * authenticated requests.
   *
   * The authentication process begins by validating that both email and
   * password fields are provided. The system looks up the user account by email
   * address (case-insensitive comparison) in the todo_list_users table. If no
   * account exists with the provided email, the operation returns a generic
   * error message to prevent email enumeration attacks.
   *
   * For existing accounts, the system verifies the provided password against
   * the stored password_hash using bcrypt comparison. If the password does not
   * match, the operation returns the same generic error message as for
   * non-existent accounts: "Invalid email or password." This security measure
   * prevents attackers from determining whether an email address is registered
   * in the system.
   *
   * The system implements brute force protection by tracking failed login
   * attempts per user account. After 5 consecutive failed attempts, the account
   * is temporarily locked for 15 minutes. During this lockout period, all login
   * attempts for that account return an HTTP 429 error with the message "Too
   * many login attempts. Please wait 15 minutes before trying again."
   *
   * Upon successful authentication, the system generates two JWT tokens: an
   * access token with 30-minute expiration and a refresh token with 30-day
   * expiration. The access token payload includes userId, email, role (set to
   * "user"), and issued-at timestamp. The refresh token payload includes
   * userId, tokenType (set to "refresh"), and issued-at timestamp. Both tokens
   * are signed using HS256 algorithm with a secure secret key stored in
   * environment configuration.
   *
   * The refresh token is hashed and stored in the todo_list_refresh_tokens
   * table with the user reference, expiration timestamp, and creation
   * timestamp. The revoked_at field is set to null, indicating an active token.
   * This enables server-side token validation and revocation capabilities for
   * logout and password change operations.
   *
   * The operation updates the user's last login timestamp and resets the failed
   * login attempt counter. The system logs all login attempts (successful and
   * failed) with timestamp, IP address, and user agent for security monitoring
   * purposes.
   *
   * This operation is accessible to unauthenticated guest users, as
   * authentication is the purpose of the endpoint. No prior authentication
   * token is required. The returned tokens must be included in subsequent
   * requests to protected endpoints for authorization.
