   * Request password reset for a user account.
   *
   * Initiates the password reset workflow for users who have forgotten their
   * password and need to regain access to their account. This operation
   * provides a secure mechanism for users to reset their credentials without
   * requiring authentication.
   *
   * When a user submits their email address, the system validates that an
   * account exists with that email in the todo_list_users table. If the account
   * exists and is active (deleted_at is null), the system generates a unique,
   * time-limited password reset token and sends it to the user's registered
   * email address. The reset link expires after 1 hour for security purposes.
   *
   * Security considerations include rate limiting to prevent abuse (maximum 3
   * reset requests per email per hour), protection against email enumeration
   * attacks by returning the same success message regardless of whether the
   * email exists, and secure token generation using cryptographically strong
   * random values. The operation logs all password reset requests for security
   * monitoring.
   *
   * The password reset token is single-use and becomes invalid once used or
   * after expiration. If a user requests multiple password resets, only the
   * most recent token remains valid. This operation does not require
   * authentication since users who need password reset cannot authenticate.
   *
   * Related operations: This operation must be followed by POST
   * /auth/password-reset/confirm to complete the password reset process. Users
   * receive the reset token via email and use it in the confirmation endpoint.
   *

  /**
   * Confirm password reset and set new password for user account.
   *
   * Completes the password reset workflow by validating the reset token and
   * updating the user's password to a new secure value. This operation is the
   * second step in the password reset process, following the initial reset
   * request.
   *
   * When a user submits the password reset token (received via email) along
   * with their new password, the system validates several security
   * requirements. First, it verifies the reset token is valid, not expired
   * (tokens expire after 1 hour), and has not been previously used. Second, it
   * validates the new password meets security requirements: minimum 8
   * characters, containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter,
   * and one number.
   *
   * If validation succeeds, the system updates the password_hash field in the
   * todo_list_users table using bcrypt with a minimum cost factor of 10. The
   * system then invalidates all existing user sessions for security by deleting
   * all associated records from the todo_list_refresh_tokens table, forcing the
   * user to log in again with their new password on all devices.
   *
   * Security measures include: the reset token is immediately invalidated after
   * use (even if password update fails), all previous reset tokens for that
   * user are invalidated, and a confirmation email is sent to the user's
   * registered email address notifying them of the password change. The
   * operation logs all password reset completions for security auditing.
   *
   * Error scenarios include expired tokens, invalid tokens, tokens that have
   * already been used, and passwords that don't meet security requirements.
   * Each error returns specific guidance to help users complete the process
   * successfully.
   *
   * Related operations: This operation must be preceded by POST
   * /auth/password-reset/request which sends the reset token to the user's
   * email. After successful password reset, users must use POST /auth/login
   * with their new credentials.
