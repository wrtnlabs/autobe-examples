  /**
   * Register a new guest user account and issue authentication tokens.
   *
   * Enables new users to create an account in the Todo list application by
   * providing their email address and password. This is the primary onboarding
   * endpoint for guest users to become authenticated users.
   *
   * The registration process performs comprehensive validation before account
   * creation. The email address must follow standard email format and be unique
   * across all users - no duplicate email addresses are allowed. The password
   * must meet minimum security requirements: at least 8 characters long,
   * containing both letters and numbers. Weak or commonly used passwords are
   * rejected to ensure account security.
   *
   * When validation succeeds, the system creates a new user account in the
   * todo_list_users table. The password is securely hashed using bcrypt with a
   * minimum cost factor of 10 before storage - plain text passwords are never
   * stored. The system automatically generates a unique user ID, sets the
   * created_at and updated_at timestamps, and ensures deleted_at is null for
   * the new active account.
   *
   * Upon successful account creation, the system immediately authenticates the
   * new user by generating JWT tokens. An access token (expires in 30 minutes)
   * and a refresh token (expires in 30 days) are issued. The refresh token is
   * securely stored in the todo_list_refresh_tokens table with its hashed
   * value, expiration timestamp, and created_at timestamp. This automatic login
   * provides a seamless onboarding experience - users can immediately begin
   * creating todos without a separate login step.
   *
   * If registration fails due to duplicate email, weak password, or invalid
   * email format, the system returns clear error messages guiding users to
   * correct the issue. All registration attempts (successful and failed) are
   * logged for security monitoring.

  /**
   * Refresh access token using valid refresh token.
   *
   * Enables users to obtain new access tokens using their valid refresh tokens
   * without requiring re-authentication, supporting seamless session
   * continuity.
   *
   * The token refresh mechanism maintains user sessions beyond the short-lived
   * access token expiration (30 minutes) without forcing frequent re-login.
   * When a client's access token expires, it can request a new one by
   * presenting a valid refresh token to this endpoint.
   *
   * The validation process is comprehensive and security-focused. First, the
   * system verifies the refresh token's JWT signature using the same secret key
   * used for signing. If signature verification fails, the request is
   * immediately rejected with HTTP 401 Unauthorized and error code
   * TOKEN_INVALID - this prevents tampered or forged tokens from being
   * accepted.
   *
   * Next, the system extracts the userId from the token payload and queries the
   * todo_list_refresh_tokens table to find a matching token record. The
   * provided token is hashed and compared against stored token_hash values for
   * the user. If no matching token exists, the request fails with HTTP 401 and
   * error code REFRESH_TOKEN_NOT_FOUND - this catches scenarios where tokens
   * were never issued or have been deleted.
   *
   * The system then validates the token hasn't expired by comparing the current
   * timestamp against the expires_at field. Refresh tokens expire 30 days after
   * issuance. If the token is expired, the request fails with HTTP 401 and
   * error code REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRED, requiring the user to log in again to
   * obtain a new refresh token.
   *
   * Revocation status is checked by examining the revoked_at field. If this
   * field is non-null, the token has been explicitly revoked - typically when a
   * user logs out, changes their password, or requests 'logout from all
   * devices'. Revoked tokens cannot be used even if not yet expired, and the
   * request fails with HTTP 401 and error code REFRESH_TOKEN_REVOKED.
   *
   * Finally, the system verifies the associated user account is still active by
   * checking the deleted_at field in the todo_list_users table is null. If the
   * account has been soft-deleted, the refresh token is invalid and the request
   * fails.
   *
   * When all validations pass, the system generates a new access token with the
   * same payload structure (userId, email, role) but with a fresh 30-minute
   * expiration timestamp. The new access token is signed and returned to the
   * client.
   *
   * For enhanced security, the system may implement refresh token rotation:
   * when a refresh token is used successfully, a new refresh token is issued
   * and the old one is revoked. This is done by creating a new record in
   * todo_list_refresh_tokens with a fresh token_hash and expires_at (30 days
   * from now), setting created_at to current timestamp, and updating the old
   * token's revoked_at to the current timestamp. If token rotation is enabled,
   * the response includes both the new access token and the new refresh token.
   *
   * This token refresh mechanism balances security and user experience - access
   * tokens remain short-lived for security while refresh tokens enable
   * long-lived sessions without constant re-authentication.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Refresh token request containing the current valid refresh
   *   token
