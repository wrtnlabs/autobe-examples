   * Register new user account and issue authentication tokens for
   * todo_list_users table.
   *
   * Registers a new user account in the Todo list application and issues JWT
   * authentication tokens.
   *
   * This operation creates a new user account with the provided email and
   * password credentials. The system performs comprehensive validation
   * including email format verification, email uniqueness check, and password
   * strength validation (minimum 8 characters with letters and numbers). Upon
   * successful validation, the password is securely hashed using bcrypt with
   * cost factor 12 before storage.
   *
   * The registration process follows these steps: validate email format and
   * uniqueness, validate password strength requirements, hash the password
   * using bcrypt, create the user account record in todo_list_users table,
   * generate JWT access token (30-minute expiration) and refresh token (30-day
   * expiration), store the refresh token hash in todo_list_refresh_tokens
   * table, and return the complete authentication response.
   *
   * Security measures include password hashing with bcrypt, JWT token
   * generation with HS256 signing, rate limiting (maximum 3 registration
   * attempts per IP per hour), and protection against common vulnerabilities.
   * The operation returns HTTP 409 if the email already exists, HTTP 400 for
   * validation errors, and HTTP 201 with authentication tokens on success.
   *
   * The response includes the user's profile information (id, email,
   * created_at), JWT access token for API authentication, and refresh token for
   * session renewal. After successful registration, users can immediately
   * access all todo management features without additional login.
   *
   * This operation relates to the todo_list_users table creation workflow and
   * is a prerequisite for all authenticated todo management operations.

  /**
   * Authenticate user credentials and issue session tokens for todo_list_users

   *
   * Authenticates existing user credentials and establishes an authenticated
   * session with JWT tokens.
   *
   * This operation validates user login credentials by verifying the email
   * exists in the todo_list_users table and comparing the provided password
   * against the stored bcrypt password hash. The authentication process
   * implements several security measures including constant-time password
   * comparison to prevent timing attacks, account activity verification
   * (deleted_at must be null), and comprehensive brute force protection.
   *
   * The login workflow executes these steps: validate that both email and
   * password are provided, lookup the user account by email address, verify the
   * account is active (not soft-deleted), validate the password using bcrypt
   * comparison against password_hash, check for account lockout due to failed
   * attempts, generate new JWT access token with 30-minute expiration, generate
   * new JWT refresh token with 30-day expiration, store the refresh token hash
   * in todo_list_refresh_tokens table, update the user's login activity
   * timestamp, and return the complete authentication response.
   *
   * Security implementations include bcrypt password verification with
   * constant-time comparison, JWT token generation using HS256 algorithm with
   * 256-bit secret key, brute force protection tracking failed login attempts
   * (locks account for 15 minutes after 5 consecutive failures), rate limiting
   * on login endpoint, comprehensive security logging of all authentication
   * attempts, and generic error messages that don't reveal whether email
   * exists.
   *
   * The operation returns HTTP 401 for invalid credentials (without revealing
   * which field is incorrect for security), HTTP 429 when rate limit or account
   * lockout is triggered, HTTP 400 for missing required fields, and HTTP 200
   * with authentication tokens on success. Error responses maintain security by
   * using the same message for non-existent email and wrong password
   * scenarios.
   *
   * The response includes complete user profile information (id, email,
   * created_at, updated_at), JWT access token for authenticating API requests,
   * refresh token for obtaining new access tokens, and token expiration
   * information. Users can immediately access all todo management features
   * after successful login.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the session management system and is
   * followed by token refresh operations when access tokens expire.

  /**
   * Refresh expired access token using valid refresh token for session

   *
   * This operation enables seamless session continuation when JWT access tokens
   * expire after their 30-minute lifetime. Users submit their refresh token to
   * obtain a new access token without re-authentication, maintaining
   * uninterrupted access to the application. The system validates the refresh
   * token against stored hashes in todo_list_refresh_tokens table and ensures
   * all security requirements are met.
   *
   * The refresh workflow executes these steps: validate that refresh token is
   * provided in request, lookup the refresh token hash in
   * todo_list_refresh_tokens table, verify token signature and integrity, check
   * token hasn't expired (expires_at is in the future), verify token hasn't
   * been revoked (revoked_at is null), confirm the associated user account
   * exists and is active (deleted_at is null in todo_list_users), generate new
   * JWT access token with fresh 30-minute expiration containing userId and role
   * claims, optionally implement token rotation by generating new refresh token
   * and invalidating the old one, update token usage tracking, and return the
   * new authentication tokens.
   *
   * Security implementations include refresh token validation against stored
   * hashes using secure comparison, expiration timestamp verification ensuring
   * tokens are used within 30-day validity period, revocation status checking
   * to prevent use of invalidated tokens, user account status verification,
   * optional token rotation where each refresh generates a new refresh token
   * and invalidates the old one (limiting exposure window), rate limiting to
   * prevent token refresh abuse, comprehensive logging of all refresh attempts
   * for security monitoring, and immediate token invalidation on security
   * events.
   *
   * The operation returns HTTP 401 with error code TOKEN_EXPIRED when the
   * refresh token has expired (user must log in again), HTTP 401 with error
   * code TOKEN_REVOKED when token has been invalidated, HTTP 401 with error
   * code TOKEN_INVALID for malformed or tampered tokens, HTTP 404 when token
   * not found in database, HTTP 403 when associated user account is inactive or
   * deleted, and HTTP 200 with new tokens on success.
   *
   * The response includes new JWT access token with fresh expiration,
   * optionally new refresh token if rotation is enabled, token expiration
   * timestamps, and user identification information. This enables client
   * applications to automatically refresh tokens before expiration, providing
   * seamless user experience without interruption.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the session management system and is
   * critical for maintaining long-lived user sessions. It works in conjunction
   * with login operations and supports the authentication flow defined in the
   * security requirements. When refresh tokens expire after 30 days, users must
   * perform a new login operation.
