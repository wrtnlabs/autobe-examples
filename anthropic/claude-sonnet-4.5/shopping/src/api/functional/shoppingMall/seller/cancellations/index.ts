/**
 * Search and retrieve filtered list of order cancellation records for sellers.
 *
 * Retrieves a comprehensive, paginated list of order cancellation records from
 * the shopping_mall_cancellations table with advanced filtering, searching, and
 * sorting capabilities. This seller-specific endpoint enables sellers to review
 * cancellation requests for orders containing their products.
 *
 * Sellers use this endpoint to review cancellation requests for orders
 * containing their products. The operation filters to show cancellations where
 * the seller is either the requester (seller-initiated cancellations due to
 * stock issues) or the approver (customer-requested cancellations requiring
 * seller approval). This enables sellers to manage pending cancellation
 * requests within the required 24-hour response window and track refund
 * processing status.
 *
 * The operation supports sophisticated filtering including cancellation status
 * (pending_approval, approved, rejected, completed), date range queries for
 * requested_at timestamp, refund processing status, and approval workflow
 * states. Sorting options include most recent cancellations first, highest
 * refund amounts, and cancellations approaching approval deadlines. Sellers can
 * prioritize cancellations requiring their immediate action.
 *
 * Security and authorization ensure that sellers only see cancellations related
 * to their products, maintaining data privacy across the multi-vendor
 * marketplace. The operation validates seller identity and filters results
 * appropriately.
 *
 * The response includes complete cancellation details: order information,
 * requester and approver identities, cancellation reason and notes, refund
 * amounts, processing status, and complete timeline from request through
 * approval to refund completion. Pagination enables efficient handling of large
 * result sets, critical for sellers managing high volumes of cancellations.
