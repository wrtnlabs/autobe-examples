/**
 * Create a new SKU variant for an existing product.
 *
 * Create a new Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) variant for an existing product with a
 * unique combination of variant attributes such as color, size, and custom
 * options. This operation enables sellers to expand their product catalog by
 * adding new variants to existing products, each with independent pricing and
 * inventory tracking.
 *
 * The SKU creation process requires the seller to specify which variant
 * attributes apply to this SKU by providing foreign key references to
 * shopping_mall_sku_colors, shopping_mall_sku_sizes, and
 * shopping_mall_sku_options entities. Not all attributes are required - a
 * product might have only color variants, only size variants, or a combination
 * of multiple attributes. The system validates that the combination of
 * attributes is unique within the parent product to prevent duplicate SKU
 * creation.
 *
 * Each new SKU must have a unique sku_code generated automatically by the
 * system or provided by the seller. This code must be unique across the entire
 * platform, not just within the product. The seller specifies the price for
 * this specific variant, which can differ from the base product price to
 * accommodate size-based pricing, premium color charges, or custom option
 * pricing differences.
 *
 * Initial inventory configuration is critical during SKU creation. The seller
 * provides the available_quantity (initial stock for sale), and the system
 * initializes reserved_quantity to zero. The seller can also configure the
 * low_stock_threshold that triggers inventory alerts when stock falls below
 * this level (default is 10 units). The is_active flag determines whether
 * customers can immediately purchase this variant or if it should be hidden
 * from catalog display.
 *
 * Security and authorization are essential for this operation. Only sellers can
 * create SKUs, and they can only create SKUs for products they own. The system
 * validates that the authenticated seller's ID matches the
 * shopping_mall_seller_id of the parent product before allowing SKU creation.
 * Admins have override capability to create SKUs for any product during
 * exceptional circumstances.
 *
 * The operation returns the complete created SKU entity including the generated
 * ID, sku_code, timestamps, and all configured attributes. This allows the
 * seller to immediately verify the SKU was created correctly and obtain the SKU
 * ID for subsequent operations like uploading variant-specific images or
 * updating inventory.
 *
 * Business logic validation includes ensuring prices are positive numbers
 * greater than zero, inventory quantities are non-negative integers, and
 * attribute references point to valid, existing entities. The system prevents
 * creating SKUs with attribute combinations that would result in duplicate
 * variants for the same product.
 *
 * This operation integrates with the product catalog management system and
 * inventory management workflows, triggering events that may update product
 * availability status and enable the new variant for customer purchase once
 * created.

 *
 * The operation maintains the relationship between products and their SKUs as

/**
 * Permanently delete a product SKU variant from the system.
 *
 * Permanently removes a product SKU variant from the database. This operation
 * performs a hard delete as the shopping_mall_skus table does not support soft
 * deletion. Once deleted, the SKU cannot be recovered and all associated data
 * is permanently removed.
 *
 * The operation validates that the specified SKU belongs to the specified
 * product to ensure proper data relationships. Sellers can only delete SKUs
 * from products they own, while administrators have platform-wide access to
 * delete any SKU.
 *
 * Critical validation includes checking that the SKU is not referenced in
 * existing order items (shopping_mall_order_items table) to preserve order
 * history integrity. If the SKU has been purchased in any order, the deletion
 * is blocked and an appropriate error is returned. This ensures historical
 * order data remains accurate and customers can view their past purchases
 * correctly.
 *
 * Additional validation checks include verifying that the product has at least
 * one other active SKU remaining after deletion, as products cannot exist
 * without any purchasable variants. If this is the last SKU for a product, the
 * deletion may be blocked or the product status may need to be updated
 * accordingly.
 *
 * The operation also cleans up related data including cart items
 * (shopping_mall_cart_items), wishlist items (shopping_mall_wishlist_items),
 * and product images (shopping_mall_product_images) that are specific to the
 * deleted SKU variant. These cascading deletions ensure data consistency across
 * the system.
 *
 * Security considerations include role-based access control where sellers can
 * only delete SKUs from their own products and admins can delete any SKU. The
 * operation logs the deletion action for audit trail purposes, recording who
 * deleted the SKU, when, and which product it belonged to.
 *
 * This operation is typically used when sellers need to remove discontinued
 * variants, correct erroneous SKU entries created by mistake, or clean up
 * product listings by removing variants that are no longer offered. Because
 * this is a permanent deletion, it should be used with caution and appropriate
 * confirmation prompts in the user interface.
