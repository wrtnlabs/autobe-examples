/**
 * Permanently delete a specific image from a product review.
 *
 * Removes a customer-uploaded image from a product review, operating on the
 * shopping_mall_review_images table in the Reviews namespace. This endpoint
 * serves two primary use cases: allowing customers to remove images they
 * uploaded to their own reviews, and enabling admins to remove inappropriate
 * images during content moderation workflows.
 *
 * Customers can upload up to 5 images per review (JPEG, PNG, WebP formats, 5MB
 * max per image) to provide visual evidence and context for their product
 * feedback. These images are particularly valuable for reviews involving
 * defective or damaged products, helping other customers make informed purchase
 * decisions. This deletion endpoint provides customers with control over their
 * submitted media content.
 *
 * The operation performs a permanent hard delete as the
 * shopping_mall_review_images table does not include a deleted_at column. When
 * an image is removed, the record is completely deleted from the database. The
 * system automatically recalculates the display_order values for remaining
 * images in the review to maintain sequential ordering (1, 2, 3...) without
 * gaps.
 *
 * Business rules enforced by this operation include verification that the
 * requesting user has appropriate permissions (review author for
 * customer-initiated deletions, or admin role for moderation-initiated
 * deletions). The operation validates that both the review and the image exist
 * and that the image actually belongs to the specified review before proceeding
 * with deletion.
 *
 * Related operations that work together with this endpoint include the review
 * creation and update endpoints that initially upload and manage review images,
 * and the review retrieval endpoints that display the remaining images after
 * deletion. The review moderation workflow also uses this endpoint when admins
 * identify policy-violating image content that must be removed.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.reviewId Unique identifier of the parent product review
 *   containing the image to be deleted
