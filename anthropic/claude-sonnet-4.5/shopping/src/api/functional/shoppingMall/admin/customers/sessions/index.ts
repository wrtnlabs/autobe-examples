/**
 * Retrieve and filter active sessions for a specific customer account.
 *
 * Retrieves a comprehensive list of all active sessions associated with a
 * specific customer account, supporting advanced filtering and pagination. This
 * operation queries the shopping_mall_sessions table for records where
 * user_type is 'customer' and matches the specified customer ID parameter.
 *
 * This endpoint serves multiple critical business purposes. First, it enables
 * customers to monitor their account security by viewing all active login
 * sessions across different devices and browsers. Customers can identify which
 * devices are currently logged in, where those sessions originated (IP address
 * and approximate location), and when each session was last active. This
 * visibility is essential for detecting unauthorized access and maintaining
 * account security.
 *
 * Second, the operation supports the multi-device session management feature
 * described in the requirements. Customers can see sessions from their desktop
 * computer, mobile phone, tablet, and any other devices simultaneously logged
 * in. Each session record includes detailed device information parsed from the
 * user agent string, including device type (mobile, tablet, desktop), browser
 * name, operating system, and a user-friendly device name for easy
 * identification.
 *
 * The filtering capabilities provided through the request body enable customers
 * to narrow down sessions by specific criteria. For example, customers can
 * filter sessions by device type to see only mobile sessions, or filter by date
 * range to find sessions created within a specific timeframe. This is
 * particularly useful for customers with many active sessions who want to
 * identify and manage specific sessions.
 *
 * From a security perspective, this operation provides the foundation for
 * customers to detect and respond to suspicious activity. If a customer sees a
 * session from an unfamiliar location or device, they can identify it through
 * this endpoint and then use related session revocation endpoints to terminate
 * that session. The approximate location information, derived from IP address
 * geolocation, helps customers quickly identify whether a session is
 * legitimate.
 *
 * Administrators also use this operation for customer support and security
 * investigations. When a customer reports unauthorized account access,
 * administrators can retrieve the session list to identify suspicious sessions
 * and take appropriate action. The comprehensive session details including IP
 * addresses and timestamps provide valuable forensic information.
 *
 * The response includes pagination support for customers with many historical
 * sessions, ensuring efficient data retrieval and display. Sessions are
 * typically sorted by last activity timestamp with most recent sessions first,
 * allowing customers to quickly see their active sessions.
 *
 * Related operations that customers might use together with this endpoint
 * include session revocation (to terminate specific sessions), login history
 * retrieval, and account security settings management. Together, these
 * operations provide complete session lifecycle management and security control
 * for customer accounts.
