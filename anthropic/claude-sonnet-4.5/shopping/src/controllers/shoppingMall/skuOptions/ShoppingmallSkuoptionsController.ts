   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific custom SKU option by ID.
   *
   * This operation fetches complete details for a single custom SKU option
   * identified by its unique ID. Custom options enable flexible product variant
   * configurations beyond standard color and size attributes, allowing sellers
   * to define product-specific attributes like storage capacity, material
   * composition, package quantities, or any other distinguishing
   * characteristic.
   *
   * The endpoint retrieves data from the shopping_mall_sku_options table which
   * stores option_name (the attribute category like 'Storage Capacity' or
   * 'Material Type') and option_value (the specific value like '128GB' or
   * 'Cotton'). Each unique combination of option_name and option_value has a
   * distinct record, ensuring no duplicates exist.
   *
   * This operation is primarily used when displaying product detail pages where
   * variant selection interfaces need to show all available custom options, or
   * when managing inventory where SKU variant attributes must be fully
   * resolved. The response includes the option's name-value pair along with
   * metadata like creation and update timestamps.
   *
   * Customers interact with this data indirectly through product variant
   * selectors on product pages. Sellers reference this data when creating or
   * editing product variants to ensure consistency in option naming and values
   * across their catalog. Admins may query this endpoint for catalog management
   * and ensuring data quality across product variants.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring only active, non-deleted options
   * are returned to customers, while sellers and admins may need visibility
   * into all options for management purposes.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param optionId Unique identifier of the target custom SKU option to
   *   retrieve
