   * Retrieve paginated list of images for a specific product review.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated collection of customer-uploaded images
   * associated with a specific product review identified by the reviewId path
   * parameter. This operation provides comprehensive access to review image
   * metadata including storage URLs, display ordering, upload timestamps, and
   * image positioning within the review's gallery.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the shopping_mall_review_images table and
   * provides read-only access to image collections. Images serve as visual
   * evidence and context for customer reviews, particularly valuable for
   * showcasing product quality, identifying defects in refund requests, and
   * building trust through authentic customer photography.
   *
   * Security considerations include validation that the specified review exists
   * and is accessible, appropriate filtering of images from unpublished or
   * moderated reviews based on the requesting user's authorization level, and
   * rate limiting to prevent automated scraping of review image URLs. Only
   * approved and published reviews' images are visible to public users, while
   * moderators and admins can access images from reviews in any moderation
   * status.
   *
   * The response includes complete image metadata optimized for gallery
   * display, with support for responsive image loading, lazy loading
   * optimization, and thumbnail generation. Images are returned in
   * display_order sequence as configured by the review author, enabling
   * accurate representation of the customer's intended visual narrative.
   *
   * This operation is commonly used in conjunction with review detail retrieval
   * endpoints to provide complete review visualization including both textual
   * content and supporting imagery. The paginated response structure supports
   * efficient loading of reviews with numerous images while maintaining
   * acceptable performance characteristics.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param reviewId Unique identifier of the target product review whose images
   *   are being retrieved
   * @param body Pagination, filtering, and sorting parameters for review image
   *   collection retrieval
