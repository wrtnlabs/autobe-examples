  /**
   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of product reviews.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated collection of product reviews from the
   * shopping mall platform. This operation provides advanced search
   * capabilities for finding reviews based on multiple criteria including
   * product ID, customer ID, rating levels, verification status, moderation
   * status, helpfulness scores, and date ranges. The endpoint supports
   * comprehensive filtering, sorting, and pagination to enable efficient review
   * discovery and management.
   *
   * This operation is essential for multiple use cases across different user
   * roles. Customers use it to browse reviews when evaluating products,
   * filtering by rating level or sorting by helpfulness to find the most useful
   * reviews. Sellers use it to monitor customer feedback on their products,
   * track review sentiment, and identify products requiring attention based on
   * negative reviews. Admins use it to manage the review moderation queue,
   * filtering by status to find pending or flagged reviews requiring approval
   * or removal.
   *
   * The review system corresponds to the shopping_mall_reviews table in the
   * Prisma schema, which stores customer product reviews with star ratings
   * (1-5), optional text content, and optional customer-uploaded images. All
   * reviews are from verified purchases, meaning only customers who completed
   * orders for the product can submit reviews. Reviews go through moderation
   * workflow before publication, with statuses including pending_moderation,
   * approved, and rejected.
   *
   * Security considerations include role-based access where customers see only
   * approved reviews when browsing products, sellers see all reviews (including
   * pending) for their products, and admins see all reviews platform-wide
   * including rejected reviews for moderation purposes. The endpoint enforces
   * appropriate filtering based on the requesting user's role and permissions.
   *
   * The response includes review content (rating, title, text), reviewer
   * information, verified purchase badges, helpfulness vote counts, moderation
   * status, associated product and SKU details, and timestamps. For reviews
   * with seller responses, it includes the response content and status. The
   * pagination structure provides total count, page information, and navigation
   * metadata to support efficient client-side display.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the product catalog to enrich reviews with
   * current product information, with the order system to verify purchase
   * eligibility, and with the helpfulness voting system to calculate and
   * display vote counts. Sorting options include most recent, most helpful,
   * highest rating, and lowest rating to support various customer browsing
   * patterns.
   *
   * Related API operations include creating new reviews (POST /reviews),
   * retrieving specific review details (GET /reviews/{reviewId}), updating
   * reviews (PUT /reviews/{reviewId}), and managing review helpfulness votes.
   * Customers typically use GET /products/{productId} to view product details
   * before searching its reviews, and POST /orders to complete purchases that
   * enable future review submission.

   * @param body Search criteria, filtering parameters, sorting options, and

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific product review by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve comprehensive details about a specific product review identified
   * by its unique review ID. This operation returns complete review information
   * from the shopping_mall_reviews table including the star rating (1-5),
   * optional review title, review text content, customer information, product
   * and SKU references, verified purchase status, moderation status, and
   * aggregated helpfulness vote counts.
   *
   * The review detail includes all associated data such as customer-uploaded

   * exist (from shopping_mall_seller_responses), and the complete review
   * metadata including creation and modification timestamps. The
   * verified_purchase badge is always true since only customers who completed
   * and received orders can submit reviews.
   *
   * Security considerations include role-based access control where customers
   * can view all approved reviews, sellers can view all reviews on their own
   * products regardless of moderation status, and admins have unrestricted
   * visibility for moderation purposes. The endpoint enforces that only
   * approved reviews (status='approved') are visible to regular customers,
   * while pending_moderation and rejected reviews are accessible only to the
   * review author, the product seller, and platform administrators.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the shopping_mall_products table to provide
   * product context, the shopping_mall_customers table for reviewer
   * information, and the shopping_mall_orders table to validate verified
   * purchase status. The response includes aggregated helpfulness vote counts
   * from shopping_mall_review_helpfulness_votes to display community feedback
   * on review quality.
   *
   * Related operations include searching reviews for a product, submitting new
   * reviews after purchase, editing existing reviews within the 30-day window,
