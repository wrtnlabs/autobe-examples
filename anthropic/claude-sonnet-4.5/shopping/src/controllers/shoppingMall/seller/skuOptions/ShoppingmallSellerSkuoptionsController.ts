  /**
   * Create a new custom SKU option for product variant configurations.
   *
   * This operation enables the creation of custom SKU option attributes that
   * extend beyond standard color and size variants. Custom options provide
   * flexibility for sellers to define product-specific attributes that
   * differentiate their SKU variants, such as storage capacity for electronics,
   * material composition for clothing, package quantities for consumables, or
   * subscription durations for services.
   *
   * The endpoint creates a new record in the shopping_mall_sku_options table
   * with the provided option_name (the attribute category) and option_value
   * (the specific value). The system enforces uniqueness on the combination of
   * option_name and option_value to prevent duplicate options across the
   * platform. For example, if 'Storage Capacity: 128GB' already exists,
   * attempting to create it again will be rejected.
   *
   * Once created, custom options become available for selection when sellers
   * create or update SKU variants through the product management interface. The
   * same option can be referenced by multiple SKUs across different products,
   * promoting consistency in variant naming and enabling effective filtering
   * and search capabilities.
   *
   * This operation is typically invoked during product listing creation
   * workflows when sellers need to define new variant attributes that don't
   * exist in the current option catalog. It may also be used by admins to
   * pre-populate common option values for specific product categories, ensuring
   * standardization across seller listings.
   *
   * Validation rules include verifying the option_name is descriptive and
   * follows consistent naming conventions (e.g., 'Storage Capacity' rather than
   * 'storage' or 'capacity'), and that option_value accurately represents the
   * specific variant characteristic. The system automatically assigns a unique
   * UUID identifier and records creation timestamp for audit purposes.
   *
   * Security considerations include restricting option creation to
   * authenticated sellers and admins, preventing spam or inappropriate option
   * values, and maintaining data integrity by rejecting options with malicious
   * content or excessive length.

  /**
   * Update an existing custom SKU option attribute for product variants.
   *
   * Updates the name and/or value of a custom SKU option attribute that is used
   * across product variants in the shopping mall catalog. This operation is
   * essential for maintaining accurate product variant information when sellers
   * need to correct option naming, update value labels, or refine variant
   * attribute definitions.
   *
   * Custom SKU options extend the standard color and size variant system by
   * allowing sellers to define product-specific attributes such as storage
   * capacity for electronics, material composition for apparel, package
   * quantities for consumables, or subscription periods for services. Each
   * option consists of an option_name (the attribute category) and option_value
   * (the specific variant) that together create unique product
   * differentiators.
   *
   * When a custom SKU option is updated through this endpoint, the changes
   * propagate to all product SKUs that reference this option. For example,
   * updating an option from 'Storage: 128GB' to 'Storage Capacity: 128 GB' will
   * automatically update the variant description for all products using this
   * option. This ensures consistency across the product catalog and prevents
   * variant attribute fragmentation.
   *
   * Access to this operation is restricted based on user roles. Sellers can
   * update custom options that belong to their own products, while admins have
   * unrestricted access to update any SKU option across the platform. The
   * system validates that the updated option_name and option_value combination
   * remains unique to prevent duplicate variant attributes.
   *
   * This operation requires validation against the shopping_mall_sku_options
   * table structure, which contains id, option_name, option_value, created_at,
   * and updated_at fields. The option_name and option_value pair must remain
   * unique after the update, and the system must ensure that all referencing
   * SKUs maintain valid variant combinations. Updates are logged with
   * timestamps for audit trail and change tracking purposes.

  /**
   * Permanently delete a custom SKU option attribute from the variant system.
   *
   * Permanently removes a custom SKU option attribute from the shopping mall
   * product variant system. This operation performs a hard delete that
   * completely removes the option record from the database, as the
   * shopping_mall_sku_options table does not support soft deletion.
   *
   * Custom SKU options are seller-defined variant attributes that extend beyond
   * the standard color and size system. Examples include storage capacity for
   * electronics (128GB, 256GB), material types for apparel (Cotton, Polyester),
   * package quantities for consumables (6-pack, 12-pack), or subscription
   * periods for services (Monthly, Annual). These options enable sellers to
   * create rich product variant combinations tailored to their specific product
   * offerings.
   *
   * Before deleting a custom SKU option, the system must validate that no
   * active product SKUs are currently referencing this option. The
   * shopping_mall_skus table contains a foreign key shopping_mall_sku_option_id
   * that links SKUs to their custom option attributes. If any SKUs reference
   * the option being deleted, the operation must be rejected to prevent
   * orphaned references and maintain catalog data integrity. Sellers or admins
   * must first reassign or discontinue affected SKUs before the option can be
   * deleted.
   *
   * This deletion operation is permanent and irreversible. Once executed, the
   * option_name and option_value combination is removed from the system and
   * cannot be recovered. Historical order data remains intact as order_items
   * snapshot variant attributes at purchase time, preserving accurate order
   * history even after variant options are deleted.
   *
   * Access to this operation is restricted by user role. Sellers can delete
   * custom options that belong exclusively to their own products and have no
   * active SKU references. Admins have broader deletion authority but must
   * still respect the referential integrity constraint requiring zero active
   * SKU references. The system logs all deletion operations with actor
   * information and timestamp for audit trail and compliance purposes.
   *

   * @param optionId Unique identifier of the custom SKU option to permanently
