   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific seller account from the

   *
   * Retrieve complete detailed information for a specific seller account on the
   * e-commerce shopping mall platform. This operation provides comprehensive
   * visibility into a seller's business profile, verification status, account
   * configuration, and operational details.
   *
   * The operation returns extensive seller information including business
   * identity (business name, business type, contact person), authentication and
   * security details (email, email verification status, account status),
   * business verification data (business registration number, tax ID, document
   * verification status), financial settings (bank account information,
   * commission rate, payout preferences), store customization (store URL slug,
   * description, logo, banner), and operational policies (return policy,
   * shipping policy, free shipping threshold).
   *
   * Security and authorization considerations are critical for this operation.
   * Administrator roles have unrestricted access to view detailed information
   * for any seller account on the platform, enabling oversight, verification,
   * and support functions. Seller roles can only access their own account
   * details, enforced through ownership validation that compares the
   * authenticated seller's ID with the requested sellerId parameter. This
   * prevents sellers from viewing competitors' business information,
   * maintaining marketplace privacy and competitive fairness.
   *
   * The response includes denormalized performance metrics and related entity
   * counts where applicable, such as total active products, total orders
   * fulfilled, average ratings, and account approval information including
   * which admin approved the account and when. Sensitive information such as
   * password hashes and full bank account numbers are excluded from the
   * response for security, with only masked/partial information provided where
   * needed for reference.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the shopping_mall_sellers table and related
   * entities as defined in the Prisma schema, including relationships to
   * shopping_mall_admins (for approval tracking), shopping_mall_products (for
   * product count), shopping_mall_orders (for fulfillment metrics), and
   * shopping_mall_addresses (for business location). The operation supports the
   * seller profile management, admin seller oversight, and seller dashboard
   * initialization use cases specified in the Seller Management and Admin
   * Dashboard requirements documents.
   *
   * Performance expectations require the operation to retrieve and return
   * seller details within 1 second under normal load conditions, with efficient
   * database queries leveraging indexed fields such as seller ID, email, and
   * account status. The response structure should be comprehensive yet
   * optimized for both display and potential editing workflows.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param sellerId Unique identifier of the target seller account to retrieve

   *
   * Updates the seller's business profile and account settings including store
   * information, policies, and preferences. This operation enables sellers to
   * maintain current business information, customize their store presence, and
   * configure operational parameters.
   *
   * The seller can update various aspects of their account including business
   * name, contact information, store branding (logo and banner), store
   * description, return and shipping policies, and payout preferences. Changes
   * to business verification information such as tax ID or bank account details
   * may require additional admin verification before taking effect.
   *
   * Security considerations include verifying that the authenticated seller is
   * updating their own account (sellerId must match the authenticated user's
   * seller ID). The system validates all input fields according to business
   * rules including email format, phone number format, URL format for images,
   * and policy text length constraints.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the shopping_mall_sellers table in the Prisma
   * schema, updating fields such as business_name, email, phone,
   * store_description, store_logo_url, store_banner_url, return_policy,
   * shipping_policy, free_shipping_threshold, and bank account information.
   * Sensitive fields like password_hash are not updated through this endpoint
   *
   * - Separate password change endpoints should be used.
   *
   * Validation rules include ensuring email uniqueness (if changed), validating
   * image URLs and file size constraints (logo max 500KB, banner max 2MB),
   * enforcing policy text length limits, and validating free shipping threshold
   * is a positive number. The updated_at timestamp is automatically set to the
   * current time when any field is modified.
   *
   * Related API operations that might be used together include seller
   * authentication endpoints for verifying the seller's identity, seller
   * product management endpoints for managing the seller's catalog, and seller
   * analytics endpoints for viewing performance metrics after profile updates.

  /**
   * Deactivate seller account with soft deletion.
   *
   * Deactivates the seller's account by performing a soft deletion, marking the
   * account as deleted while preserving all historical data for legal
   * compliance and audit purposes. This operation is typically used when a
   * seller wishes to close their business on the platform or when an admin
   * needs to remove a seller for policy violations.
   *
   * When a seller account is deleted, the system sets the deleted_at timestamp
   * in the shopping_mall_sellers table, which effectively deactivates the
   * account while maintaining data integrity for past transactions. All
   * products owned by the seller are automatically hidden from customer view,
   * preventing new orders. However, existing order history, financial
   * transaction records, seller payout history, and customer reviews remain
   * intact for compliance with tax regulations and legal record-keeping
   * requirements.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict verification that the authenticated
   * user is the seller who owns the account being deleted (sellerId must match
   * authenticated seller's ID), or that an admin with appropriate permissions
   * is performing the deletion. The operation validates that all pending orders
   * from the seller have been fulfilled or properly cancelled before allowing
   * account deletion. If the seller has pending payouts or unresolved disputes,
   * the deletion may be blocked pending resolution.
   *
   * The soft deletion mechanism updates the deleted_at field in the
   * shopping_mall_sellers table with the current timestamp. This approach
   * allows the system to filter out deleted sellers from active operations
   * while preserving complete historical records. Related entities such as
   * products (shopping_mall_products), orders (shopping_mall_orders), and
   * reviews maintain their relationships to the deleted seller through foreign
   * key references, ensuring order history displays correctly even after seller
   * account deletion.
   *
   * Business logic considerations include automatically deactivating all seller
   * products by setting their status to inactive, cancelling any pending seller
   * confirmations for new orders, processing final payouts for completed
   * orders, and notifying customers with pending orders from this seller. The
   * seller's store page becomes inaccessible to customers, but historical order
   * details continue to reference the seller's business name as it existed at
   * the time of the order.
   *
   * Validation rules enforce that sellers cannot delete their accounts if they
   * have active orders in 'confirmed', 'processing', or 'preparing_shipment'
   * states. All orders must be either delivered, cancelled, or refunded before
   * account deletion is permitted. Additionally, the seller must have zero
   * pending payout balance or agree to forfeit pending payouts (which is
   * unusual and should trigger manual admin review).
   *
   * Related API operations include seller account retrieval to view account
   * status before deletion, seller order management to ensure all orders are
   * fulfilled, and seller payout retrieval to verify all financial settlements
   * are complete. After deletion, sellers can contact platform support to
   * potentially reactivate accounts within a grace period (typically 90 days),
   * after which permanent deletion may occur.
