   * Upload and add a new image to a product's image gallery.
   *
   * This operation enables sellers to upload product images to enhance their
   * product listings with visual content. Product images are critical for
   * customer purchase decisions and product discoverability in the e-commerce
   * marketplace.
   *
   * The operation validates that the specified product exists in the
   * shopping_mall_products table and that the authenticated seller is the owner
   * of the product. Only sellers can upload images to their own products,
   * enforcing ownership-based authorization. The system checks that the product
   * has not exceeded the maximum limit of 10 images per product as defined in
   * the business requirements.
   *
   * Upon successful upload, the image is stored and a new record is created in
   * the shopping_mall_product_images table. The system automatically determines
   * the appropriate display_order based on existing images, and the is_primary
   * flag is set to true only if this is the first image for the product. The
   * image URL is generated by the storage service and persisted in the
   * database.
   *
   * The uploaded image must meet the following validation criteria: accepted
   * file formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP), maximum file size of 5MB, and minimum
   * resolution of 800x800 pixels. The system generates multiple optimized
   * versions (thumbnail 150x150, medium 600x600, large 1200x1200) for
   * responsive display across different contexts. Invalid uploads are rejected
   * with specific error messages indicating the validation failure reason.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the product catalog management system
   * defined in the requirements, supporting the seller's ability to create
   * compelling product presentations. Images uploaded through this endpoint
   * become part of the product's visual gallery displayed to customers during
   * product browsing and detail viewing.

   * operation provides advanced search and filtering capabilities for managing
   * product image galleries, supporting both general product images and
   * variant-specific images.
   *
   * The operation is designed to serve multiple user roles with different
   * access requirements. Sellers can retrieve and manage images for their own
   * products to maintain their product catalog and visual presentation.
   * Administrators can access images across all products for content
   * moderation, policy enforcement, and quality control purposes. The filtering
   * capabilities enable efficient image management even for products with large
   * image galleries.
   *
   * Security considerations include role-based access control where sellers can
   * only retrieve images for products they own, while admins have platform-wide
   * access. The operation validates that the specified product exists and that
   * the requesting user has appropriate permissions based on their role and
   * product ownership.
   *
   * The response includes comprehensive image metadata from the
   * shopping_mall_product_images schema: image URLs for display, display_order
   * for gallery sequencing, is_primary flag to identify the main product image,
   * optional SKU associations for variant-specific images, alt_text for
   * accessibility, and creation timestamps. This metadata enables sophisticated
   * image management workflows including reordering, primary image selection,
   * and variant image coordination.
   *
   * The operation supports pagination to handle products with many images
   * efficiently, with configurable page size and sorting options. Sorting can
   * be applied by display_order (for gallery sequence), creation date
   * (chronological), or primary status (main images first). Filtering options
   * include SKU-specific images, primary image only, or date range filters.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the product catalog management system
   * defined in the requirements, supporting the business rule that products
   * must have at least one image and can have up to 10 images. The
   * display_order field enables the requirement that the first image (order 0)
   * serves as the main product image in listings and search results.
   *
   * Related operations that work together with this endpoint include retrieving
   * individual image details, creating new product images, updating image
   * properties (order, primary status), and deleting images. These operations
   * collectively enable complete product image lifecycle management as

   * unique ID within the context of a specific product. This operation accesses
   * the shopping_mall_product_images table to return complete image metadata
   * and properties.
   *
   * The operation provides detailed image information including the storage URL
   * for the image file, the display_order position determining where the image
   * appears in the product gallery sequence, the is_primary boolean flag
   * indicating whether this is the main product image shown in listings,
   * optional shopping_mall_sku_id reference if the image is specific to a
   * product variant, alt_text for accessibility and SEO purposes, and the
   * created_at timestamp showing when the image was uploaded.
   *
   * Security and authorization are critical aspects of this operation. Sellers
   * can only retrieve images for products they own, validated by checking that
   * the product's shopping_mall_seller_id matches the authenticated seller's
   * ID. Administrators have unrestricted access to retrieve any product image
   * across the platform for moderation and quality control purposes. The
   * operation validates that both the product and image exist before returning
   * data, ensuring referential integrity.
   *
   * The image URL returned uses the image_url field from the
   * shopping_mall_product_images schema, which stores the full path or URL to
   * the image file. The URL format follows the pattern defined in the schema
   * with a maximum length of 80,000 characters to support long URI formats
   * including data URIs or cloud storage URLs with authentication tokens.
   *
   * The display_order field indicates the image's position in the product
   * gallery, where position 0 represents the first image (which is the main
   * product image by convention). This information is essential for image
   * management interfaces that allow reordering images or identifying which
   * image serves as the primary product representation.
   *
   * The optional shopping_mall_sku_id association enables variant-specific
   * images. When this field is populated, it indicates the image specifically
   * represents a particular color, size, or option combination. This supports
   * the business requirement that customers should see variant-specific images
   * when selecting product variants during shopping. When the field is null,
   * the image is a general product image applicable to all variants.
   *
   * This operation is frequently used in conjunction with image update
   * operations (changing display order, setting primary status, updating alt
   * text) and image deletion operations. Together, these operations enable
   * complete product image lifecycle management as specified in the product
   * catalog management requirements document.
   *
   * The operation returns a single image object with all properties from the
   * shopping_mall_product_images table, formatted according to the
   * IShoppingMallProductImage response type. Error scenarios include product

   * requiring image re-upload.
   *
   * The operation validates that the specified product exists in the

   *
   * Sellers can update the following image properties through this operation:

   * designate which image is the main product image shown in listings),
   * alt_text (for SEO and accessibility compliance), and shopping_mall_sku_id

   * variant-specific visualization).
   *
   * When changing the is_primary flag to true, the system automatically sets

   *
   * This operation is particularly useful for sellers who want to optimize
   * their product presentation by reordering images based on customer feedback,

   * images. This operation is critical for product media management, allowing
   * sellers to curate their product presentations by removing outdated,
   * incorrect, or low-quality images.
   *
   * The operation enforces strict authorization based on product ownership.
   * Sellers can only delete images from products they own (verified through
   * shopping_mall_products.shopping_mall_seller_id), while admins have
   * unrestricted access to delete any product image for content moderation
   * purposes. The system validates that the specified product and image exist
   * and that the image belongs to the specified product before processing the
   * deletion.
   *
   * Business rules enforce that products must maintain at least one image to
   * remain in active status. If the image being deleted is the only image for
   * the product, the deletion should be rejected with an appropriate error
   * message. If the deleted image is marked as the primary image (is_primary =
   * true), the system should either prevent deletion or automatically promote
   * another image to primary status to maintain product integrity.
   *
   * After successful deletion, the system recalculates the display_order values
   * for remaining images to maintain sequential ordering without gaps in the
   * gallery presentation. If the deleted image had display_order 2 in a gallery
   * with 5 images, the images with display_order 3, 4, and 5 are renumbered to
