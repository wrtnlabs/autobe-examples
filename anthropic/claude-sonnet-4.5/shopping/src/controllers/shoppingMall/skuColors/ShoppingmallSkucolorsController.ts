   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of SKU color variants.
   *
   * This operation provides comprehensive search and filtering capabilities for
   * SKU color variants stored in the shopping_mall_sku_colors table. It enables
   * retrieval of color options used throughout the platform's product catalog,
   * supporting use cases such as color filter facets in product search, seller
   * color management interfaces, and admin color taxonomy oversight.
   *
   * The operation accepts complex search criteria including text-based search
   * on color names (with support for partial matching and fuzzy search),
   * filtering by specific color attributes like hex codes, and date-based
   * filtering for recently added colors. The search functionality uses
   * full-text search capabilities with trigram indexing on the name field to
   * provide efficient and flexible color discovery.
   *
   * Pagination support is essential as the platform may accumulate hundreds of
   * distinct color variants across all sellers and products. The request body
   * should include pagination parameters such as page number, page size, and
   * optional cursor-based pagination for efficient large dataset traversal.
   * Default page size should be configurable but typically 20-50 color records
   * per page.
   *
   * Sorting capabilities allow ordering results by color name (alphabetical),
   * creation date (newest or oldest first), or usage frequency (colors used in
   * the most active SKUs). This helps users discover popular colors, recently
   * added options, or navigate alphabetically through the color taxonomy.
   *
   * The response includes comprehensive color information from the
   * shopping_mall_sku_colors table: unique color ID, color name, optional hex
   * code for visual representation, creation timestamp, and optionally
   * aggregated statistics like the number of SKUs using each color. The
   * hex_code field enables client applications to render accurate color
   * swatches in filter interfaces and product variant selectors.
   *
   * Authorization is public (empty array) as color variant information is
   * non-sensitive reference data needed for product browsing and filtering.
   * Customers need to view available colors when filtering products, sellers
   * need to select colors when creating product variants, and admins need to
   * manage the color taxonomy. No authentication is required for read access to
   * color options.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the product catalog search and filtering
   * functionality defined in the Product Catalog Management requirements. Color
   * filters are a critical component of the product discovery experience,
   * enabling customers to narrow product searches to their preferred color
   * options. The operation supports the SKU variant architecture where colors
   * are one of the primary differentiating attributes alongside size and custom
   * options.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria, filtering parameters, sorting options, and
   *   pagination settings for SKU color variant retrieval

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific SKU color variant by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve complete details of a specific SKU color variant identified by its
   * unique color ID from the shopping_mall_sku_colors table. This operation
   * provides comprehensive color information including the color name displayed
   * to customers (e.g., 'Navy Blue', 'Forest Green', 'Crimson Red') and the
   * optional hex color code used for visual swatch representation in product
   * variant selection interfaces.
   *
   * This endpoint serves multiple business purposes across different user
   * roles. Customers use this information when browsing product variants to see
   * available color options with visual swatches. Sellers reference color
   * details when creating or updating product SKUs to maintain consistent color
   * variant definitions across their catalog. Admins access this endpoint when
   * managing the platform-wide color taxonomy and ensuring color data
   * consistency.
   *
   * The color information is critical for the product variant selection
   * workflow. When customers select product variants, the system displays color
   * options using the name and hex code to provide both textual and visual
   * identification. The hex code enables rendering color swatches that give
   * customers an accurate preview of the actual product color before making a
   * purchase decision.
   *
   * Security considerations include standard authentication to ensure only
   * valid users access the system, though color information itself is generally
   * non-sensitive reference data. The endpoint returns the complete color
   * record including the creation timestamp for audit purposes.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the broader product catalog system where SKU
   * color variants are referenced by shopping_mall_skus records through the
   * shopping_mall_sku_color_id foreign key relationship. The color data is
   * shared across multiple products and SKUs, maintaining a centralized color
   * taxonomy that ensures consistency throughout the marketplace.
