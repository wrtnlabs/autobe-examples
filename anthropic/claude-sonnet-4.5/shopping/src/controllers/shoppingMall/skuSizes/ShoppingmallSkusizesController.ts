  /**
   * Retrieve filtered and paginated list of SKU size variants.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of size variant
   * attributes from the shopping_mall_sku_sizes table. Size variants are
   * essential attributes that differentiate product SKUs by size dimensions,
   * supporting diverse sizing systems including standard sizes (Small, Medium,
   * Large), numeric sizes (38, 40, 42), and specialized size categories (US
   * Sizes, EU Sizes, One Size).
   *
   * This operation provides advanced search and filtering capabilities to
   * locate specific size variants based on value patterns, category
   * classifications, and creation date ranges. It supports pagination to
   * efficiently handle large datasets of size options across the platform's
   * product catalog.
   *
   * Size variants are referenced by shopping_mall_skus records to create
   * specific purchasable product variants. For example, a clothing product
   * might have SKUs for each combination of color and size, where size
   * references records from this table. The operation enables administrators
   * and sellers to browse available size options when configuring product
   * variants, and supports bulk size management workflows.
   *
   * The response includes complete size information including the size value
   * (displayed to customers), optional size category (sizing system identifier
   * like 'US Sizes' or 'EU Sizes'), and metadata such as creation and update
   * timestamps. Pagination parameters control the number of results per page
   * and enable navigation through large size catalogs.
   *
   * This endpoint is particularly useful for product variant configuration
   * interfaces, inventory management dashboards, and analytics on size
   * availability and usage across the product catalog. Search functionality
   * allows finding specific sizes by value patterns, enabling quick lookup
   * during product listing creation.
   *
   * Security considerations include role-based access control, with different
   * visibility and filtering options based on user role. Public access may be
   * restricted to active, customer-facing size lists, while sellers and
   * administrators can access comprehensive size catalogs including recently
   * added or modified entries for management purposes.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search, filter, and pagination parameters for retrieving size
   *   variants including value pattern matching, category filtering, date range
   *   filters, sorting options, and pagination controls

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific SKU size variant by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve comprehensive information for a specific size variant attribute
   * from the shopping_mall_sku_sizes table identified by its unique UUID. Size
   * variants are fundamental attributes in the product variant system,
   * representing different sizing options that customers can select when
   * purchasing products.
   *
   * This operation returns complete size information including the size value
   * (the actual size displayed to customers such as 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large',
   * '38', '40', or '42'), the optional size category that indicates the sizing
   * system (e.g., 'US Sizes', 'EU Sizes', 'One Size', 'Numeric'), and temporal
   * metadata including creation and last update timestamps.
   *
   * Size variants are referenced by shopping_mall_skus records through the
   * shopping_mall_sku_size_id foreign key to create specific purchasable
   * product variants. For example, a clothing product with multiple sizes would
   * have separate SKU records for each size, all referencing size variant
   * records from this table. The unique combination of color, size, and option
   * attributes defines each distinct SKU.
   *
   * The endpoint is particularly useful when:
   *
   * - Product management interfaces need to display complete size information for
   *   a specific variant
   * - Sellers are configuring product variants and need to view detailed size
   *   attributes
   * - Customer-facing product pages display size information with category
   *   context (e.g., showing 'Size: Medium (US Sizes)')
   * - Administrative tools retrieve size data for reporting, analytics, or bulk
   *   operations
   * - Validation workflows verify size existence and attributes before creating
   *   or updating SKUs
   *
   * The size variant data model supports flexible sizing systems through the
   * combination of value and category fields. The value field stores the actual
   * size designation, while the optional category field provides additional
   * context about the sizing system, enabling the platform to support diverse
   * product categories with different sizing conventions (apparel with S/M/L,
   * shoes with numeric sizes, international size standards, etc.).
   *
   * Security and access control: This operation is publicly accessible since
   * size information is non-sensitive product catalog data required for product
   * browsing and variant selection. All user roles (customers, sellers, admins)
   * and even unauthenticated users can retrieve size information to support
   * product discovery and purchase workflows.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param sizeId Unique identifier of the target size variant attribute to
   *   retrieve from shopping_mall_sku_sizes table
