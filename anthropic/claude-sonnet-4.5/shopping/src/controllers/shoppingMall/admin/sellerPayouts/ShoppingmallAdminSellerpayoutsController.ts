   * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated list of seller payout records.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of seller payout
   * records representing financial settlements between the platform and
   * sellers. This operation enables advanced search capabilities for payout
   * reconciliation, financial reporting, and seller account management by
   * allowing filtering based on multiple criteria including seller identifier,
   * payout period date ranges, processing status, and payout amounts.
   *
   * Seller payouts are generated on a regular schedule (typically weekly or
   * monthly) and represent the platform's obligation to transfer net earnings
   * to sellers after deducting platform commission, processing fees, and any
   * refund amounts from the payout period. Each payout record calculates the
   * final net amount using the formula: Net Payout = (Total Order Amount +
   * Shipping Fees) - Platform Commission - Refund Deductions - Processing
   * Fees.
   *
   * The request body supports extensive filtering options: seller ID for
   * viewing specific seller's payouts, status filters for tracking payout
   * lifecycle (pending, processing, completed, failed, on_hold), date range
   * filters for payout periods to analyze settlements over time, and amount
   * range filters for identifying high-value or problematic payouts. Pagination
   * parameters enable efficient handling of large payout datasets.
   *
   * Each payout record in the response includes comprehensive financial
   * breakdown: the settlement period covered (start and end dates), total gross
   * revenue from seller's orders during that period, platform commission amount
   * deducted, refund deduction amount for returns/cancellations, payment
   * processing fees, final net payout amount, currency, payout processing
   * status, payout method used (bank transfer, PayPal, etc.), payout reference
   * numbers, scheduled and actual payout dates, and detailed timestamps for
   * processing stages.
   *
   * This operation is essential for financial operations teams managing
   * platform-wide seller settlements, accountants reconciling payout
   * transactions with bank records, and potentially for sellers to view their
   * own payout history and financial statements. Authorization controls ensure
   * customers cannot access payout data (business-to-business financial
   * information), sellers can only view their own payouts when applicable, and
   * admins have unrestricted access for platform oversight.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the payment settlement workflow, providing
   * visibility into the complete lifecycle from payout calculation through bank
   * transfer processing to completion or failure handling. Failed payouts
   * include detailed failure reasons enabling support teams to resolve issues
   * such as invalid bank account information or insufficient platform funds.

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific seller payout by payout ID.
   *
   * Retrieve complete details of a specific seller payout record by its unique
   * identifier. This operation provides comprehensive financial information
   * about a payout settlement including the settlement period covered, total
   * order revenue, platform commission deductions, refund deductions, payment
   * processing fees, and the final net payout amount transferred to the
   * seller.
   *
   * This endpoint is critical for financial transparency and reconciliation.
   * Sellers use it to verify their earnings, understand deductions, and confirm
   * payout processing status. Administrators use it to audit payout
   * calculations, investigate payout issues, and ensure accurate financial
   * settlements.
   *
   * The payout record corresponds to the shopping_mall_seller_payouts table in
   * the Prisma schema, which tracks periodic payment settlements to sellers
   * after deducting platform commission and fees. Each payout covers a specific
   * time period (typically weekly or monthly) and aggregates all eligible
   * orders delivered during that period.
   *
   * Security considerations include role-based access control where sellers can
   * only view their own payouts, while admins have platform-wide access to all
   * seller payouts. The endpoint validates that the requesting user has
   * appropriate permissions before returning payout details.
   *
   * The response includes the payout status (pending, processing, completed,
   * failed, on_hold), payout method (bank_transfer, paypal, etc.), and
   * processing timestamps. For completed payouts, it includes the payout
   * reference number for bank reconciliation. For failed payouts, it provides
   * failure reasons to help resolve payout issues.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the seller order management system to show
   * which orders contributed to the payout and with the refund system to show
   * refund deductions. It also displays commission calculations transparently
   * so sellers understand platform fee deductions.
