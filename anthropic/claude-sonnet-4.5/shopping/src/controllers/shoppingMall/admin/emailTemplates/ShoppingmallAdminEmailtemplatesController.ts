  /**
   * Create a new email template for platform communications.
   *
   * Creates a new email template in the shopping mall platform's communication
   * system. Email templates provide reusable, customizable content for
   * transactional and marketing emails sent to customers, sellers, and
   * administrators throughout various platform workflows.
   *
   * This operation enables administrators to define email templates with
   * dynamic variable placeholders that are populated with actual data when
   * emails are sent. For example, an order confirmation template might include
   * placeholders like {{order_number}}, {{customer_name}}, and {{total_amount}}
   * that are replaced with specific order details for each customer.
   *
   * The template supports both HTML and plain text body content. The HTML body
   * enables rich formatting, branding, and visual design for modern email
   * clients, while the plain text body serves as a fallback for email clients
   * that don't support HTML rendering or for accessibility purposes. Both
   * versions should convey the same essential information.
   *
   * Templates can be associated with specific channels through the
   * shopping_mall_channel_id field, enabling channel-specific customization of
   * communications. For example, a mobile app channel might have different
   * email styling than the web platform channel. When shopping_mall_channel_id
   * is null, the template is available platform-wide across all channels.
   *
   * The template_code field serves as the unique identifier used by the
   * application logic to select the appropriate template for each email sending
   * scenario. Common codes include 'ORDER_CONFIRMATION',
   * 'SHIPMENT_NOTIFICATION', 'PASSWORD_RESET', 'WELCOME_EMAIL',
   * 'REFUND_APPROVED', and 'REVIEW_REQUEST'.
   *
   * Multi-language support is provided through the language_code field
   * following ISO 639-1 standard. The platform can maintain separate templates
   * for each language, enabling localized communications. The combination of
   * template_code, language_code, and shopping_mall_channel_id must be unique.
   *
   * Template categorization through the category field enables organization by
   * business function such as 'transactional' (order/payment related),
   * 'marketing' (promotional campaigns), 'authentication' (login/verification),
   * and 'notification' (status updates). This grouping facilitates template
   * management and reporting.
   *
   * The variables_json field documents available placeholders in JSON format,
   * helping administrators understand which dynamic values can be used in the
   * template content. For example: [{"key": "order_number", "description":
   * "Unique order identifier"}, {"key": "customer_name", "description":
   * "Customer's full name"}].
   *
   * Version tracking through the version field enables audit trail of template
   * changes and potential rollback to previous versions if needed. Each update
   * increments the version number.
   *
   * Sender configuration through from_email, from_name, and reply_to_email
   * fields allows customization of the email envelope. These fields can
   * override platform defaults to provide context-specific sender
   * identification. For example, transactional emails might come from
   * 'orders@shoppingmall.com' while support emails come from
   * 'support@shoppingmall.com'.
   *
   * Only administrators with content management permissions can create email
   * templates, ensuring consistent brand voice and compliance with
   * communication policies across the platform.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Email template creation data including template identification,
   *   content bodies, variable definitions, and sender configuration

   * advanced search capabilities for administrators to find and manage email
   * templates based on multiple criteria including template category, channel
   * association, language code, active status, and content search.
   *
   * Email templates are critical platform components that define the structure
   * and content of all automated communications sent to customers, sellers, and
   * admins. Each template supports variable placeholders for dynamic content
   * personalization, multi-language support for international communications,
   * and channel-specific customization for different marketplace segments.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive filtering options to help
   * administrators locate specific templates efficiently. Filters include
   * template category (transactional emails like order confirmations, marketing
   * emails like promotional campaigns, authentication emails like password
   * reset, notification emails like shipping updates), channel assignment
   * (platform-wide templates or channel-specific variants), language code for
   * localization, and active status to show only enabled templates.
   *
   * Search functionality enables full-text search across template names,
   * subjects, and body content to locate templates containing specific keywords
   * or phrases. This is particularly valuable when administrators need to
   * update messaging across multiple related templates or audit template
   * content for compliance.
   *
   * Pagination support ensures efficient handling of large template libraries
   * as the platform grows to support multiple languages, channels, and
   * communication scenarios. The operation returns template summary information
   * optimized for list displays, with options to drill down into individual
   * templates for detailed editing.
   *
   * Security considerations include role-based access control ensuring only
   * administrators can search and view email templates, as templates may
   * contain sensitive business logic and communication strategies. Template
   * content is sanitized for display to prevent injection attacks.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the shopping_mall_channels table through the
   * optional shopping_mall_channel_id foreign key, enabling channel-specific
   * template filtering. Templates without channel association are platform-wide
   * defaults. The multi-language support through language_code enables
   * localized communications for international customers and sellers.
   *
   * Related operations that might be used together include retrieving
   * individual template details for editing, creating new templates for new
   * communication scenarios, updating template content for messaging
   * improvements, and activating/deactivating templates for A/B testing or
   * seasonal campaigns.

   * This operation provides administrators with complete template details
   * necessary for viewing, editing, testing, and managing individual email
   * communication templates.
   *
   * Email templates define the structure and content of all automated platform
   * communications sent to customers, sellers, and administrators throughout
   * various business workflows. Each template contains carefully crafted
   * messaging with dynamic variable placeholders that are replaced with actual
   * data when emails are sent. Understanding the complete template structure is
   * essential for maintaining consistent, professional communication across the
   * platform.
   *
   * The operation returns exhaustive template information including the
   * template_code (unique identifier used by application logic to select
   * templates), template_name and description for administrative reference,
   * category classification (transactional, marketing, authentication,
   * notification), and language_code for localization support. Channel
   * association is included if the template is specific to a marketplace
   * channel, otherwise null indicates platform-wide usage.
   *
   * Critical template content includes both HTML and plain text versions of the
   * email body, enabling rich formatting for modern email clients while
   * providing accessible fallback for text-only readers. The subject line
   * includes variable placeholders for personalization such as order numbers,
   * customer names, or action-specific details. Administrators can review how
   * these placeholders are used throughout the template content.
   *
   * The variables_json field provides documentation of all available
   * placeholders for this template, describing each variable's purpose and
   * expected data type. This information is invaluable when customizing
   * templates or troubleshooting template rendering issues. Sender
   * configuration (from_email, from_name, reply_to_email) defines how the email
   * appears to recipients and where replies are directed.
   *
   * Template metadata includes activation status controlling whether the
   * template can be used for sending emails, version number tracking template
   * evolution over time, and creation/update timestamps for audit trail. The
   * is_active flag allows administrators to temporarily disable templates for
   * testing or revision without deleting template history.
   *
   * Security considerations include verifying the requesting user has
   * administrator role permissions, as email templates may contain sensitive
   * business logic and communication strategies. Template content is returned
   * without modification to enable accurate editing, but administrators must be
   * trusted users as template injection could affect platform communications.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the shopping_mall_channels relationship to
   * show channel-specific template variants versus platform-wide templates.
   * Understanding channel assignment helps administrators maintain template
   * consistency across marketplace segments while allowing necessary
   * customization.
   *
   * Related operations that might be used together include searching the

  /**
   * Update an existing email template by ID.

   * Updates an existing email template in the shopping mall platform's
   * communication system. This operation enables administrators to modify
   * template content, configuration, and settings to adapt to changing business
   * requirements, fix issues, or improve email effectiveness.
   *
   * Administrators can update any aspect of the email template including the
   * subject line, HTML body content, plain text body content, sender
   * information, active status, and template metadata. Each update increments
   * the version number, creating an audit trail of template changes over time.
   *
   * The template_code serves as the functional identifier used by the
   * application to select templates for specific email scenarios. While most
   * template properties can be updated, changing the template_code effectively
   * changes which emails will use this template. Care should be taken when
   * modifying template_code to ensure application logic references remain
   * valid.
   *
   * HTML and plain text body content can be updated independently. When
   * updating email bodies, administrators should ensure both HTML and plain
   * text versions convey the same essential information for consistency across
   * email clients. The HTML body enables rich formatting and branding, while
   * the plain text version ensures accessibility and compatibility with
   * text-only email clients.
   *
   * Template variable placeholders (e.g., {{order_number}}, {{customer_name}})
   * can be added or removed from the body content. The variables_json field
   * should be updated accordingly to document available placeholders. This
   * documentation helps other administrators understand which dynamic values
   * can be used in the template.
   *
   * Sender configuration can be updated through from_email, from_name, and
   * reply_to_email fields. Changing these fields affects the sender identity
   * displayed to email recipients. For example, changing from
   * 'noreply@shoppingmall.com' to 'support@shoppingmall.com' makes the email
   * appear more personal and enables recipient replies.
   *
   * The is_active flag controls whether the template is available for sending
   * emails. Administrators can deactivate templates temporarily without
   * deletion, useful for testing new versions or temporarily disabling certain
   * email communications. Inactive templates are retained in the database but
   * not selectable for email sending operations.
   *
   * Multi-language templates can be updated independently for each
   * language_code. When updating a template for a specific language, only that
   * language version is affected. Other language versions of the same
   * template_code remain unchanged.
   *
   * Channel-specific templates (those with non-null shopping_mall_channel_id)
   * can be updated without affecting platform-wide templates or templates for
   * other channels. This enables channel-specific communication customization
   * while maintaining overall template structure.
   *
   * Template updates apply immediately to all future email sending operations
   * using this template. Emails that have already been sent are not affected by
   * template updates, ensuring historical email content remains consistent.
   *
   * The version field automatically increments with each update, providing
   * version history tracking. While this operation doesn't support rollback to
   * previous versions directly, the version history enables administrators to
   * track when changes occurred and potentially restore previous content
   * manually if needed.
   *
   * Only administrators with appropriate permissions can update email
   * templates. This restriction ensures communication consistency, maintains
   * brand standards, and prevents unauthorized modification of customer-facing
   * content. Template updates should be carefully reviewed before deployment as
   * they affect communications sent to all platform users.
