  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated list of refund requests with
   * advanced filtering capabilities.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, paginated list of refund requests with advanced
   * filtering, searching, and sorting capabilities. This operation provides
   * role-based access to refund request data, returning different result sets
   * based on the authenticated user's role and permissions.
   *
   * For customers, this endpoint returns refund requests associated with their
   * own orders, enabling them to track the status of their refund requests from
   * submission through approval and completion. Customers can filter by refund
   * status (pending_review, pending_seller_response, approved, rejected,
   * processing, completed) and date ranges to find specific refund requests or
   * monitor active refunds.
   *
   * For sellers, this endpoint returns refund requests for orders containing
   * their products, allowing sellers to manage and respond to customer refund
   * requests efficiently. Sellers can filter by refund status to prioritize
   * pending requests requiring their response within the 3-business-day
   * deadline. The seller_response_deadline field enables sellers to identify
   * urgent refund requests approaching auto-approval.
   *
   * For admins, this endpoint provides unrestricted access to all platform
   * refund requests across all customers and sellers, supporting platform-wide
   * refund management, dispute resolution, and quality monitoring. Admins can
   * filter by customer, seller, order, refund status, date ranges, and refund
   * amounts to identify patterns, resolve disputes, or investigate high-value
   * refund requests requiring admin approval.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive filtering by refund_status
   * (pending_review, approved, rejected, etc.), date ranges for requested_at
   * and reviewed_at timestamps, customer and seller identifiers, order
   * identifiers, refund amount ranges, return requirements, and refund reasons.
   * Multiple filters can be combined to create precise queries for specific
   * refund request subsets.
   *
   * Sorting options include requested_at (newest or oldest first),
   * refund_amount (highest or lowest first), refund_status, and
   * seller_response_deadline (to prioritize urgent requests). The default sort
   * order is requested_at descending (newest requests first) to surface recent
   * refund submissions.
   *
   * Pagination is implemented using limit and offset parameters, returning
   * result sets with total count for building pagination controls. The response
   * includes complete refund request details with denormalized order
   * information, customer and seller references, refund amounts (requested and
   * approved), status tracking, and timeline information (requested_at,
   * reviewed_at, completed_at).
   *
   * Security and authorization are enforced at the business logic layer,
   * automatically filtering results based on the authenticated user's role.
   * Customers see only their own refund requests, sellers see refund requests
   * for their products, and admins see all requests. The endpoint validates
   * filter parameters and returns appropriate error responses for invalid
   * filter combinations or missing required parameters.
   *
   * This operation is essential for the refund workflow management described in
   * the business requirements, supporting the 3-business-day seller response
   * deadline, auto-approval mechanism, admin escalation process, and refund
   * lifecycle tracking from request through completion. It integrates with the
   * shopping_mall_orders, shopping_mall_customers, shopping_mall_sellers, and
   * shopping_mall_admins tables through the Prisma schema relationships.
