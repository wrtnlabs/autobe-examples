   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of orders from the

   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of orders from the
   * shopping_mall_orders table based on advanced search criteria including
   * order status, date ranges, customer filters, seller filters, price ranges,
   * delivery information, and more. This operation provides flexible order
   * history access and searching capabilities for customers, sellers, and
   * admins.
   *
   * This endpoint supports complex query requirements through a request body,
   * enabling multi-field filtering, full-text search across order attributes,
   * date range filtering, and sorting options. Customers can search their own
   * order history, sellers can search orders containing their products, and
   * admins can search all platform orders with comprehensive filtering.
   *
   * The operation implements role-based data filtering: customers see only
   * their own orders, sellers see only orders containing their products, and
   * admins have unrestricted access to all orders. Authorization is enforced at
   * the business logic layer based on the authenticated user's role and
   * identity.
   *
   * Search capabilities include filtering by order number, customer name,
   * seller name, order status (pending_payment, payment_confirmed, processing,
   * shipped, delivered, cancelled, refunded, etc.), date ranges for various
   * timestamps (created_at, delivered_at, cancelled_at), price ranges, shipping
   * methods, delivery locations, and payment status. The response includes
   * order summary information optimized for list display with pagination
   * controls.
   *
   * This operation is critical for order management workflows defined in the
   * requirements document, supporting customer order history viewing, seller
   * order fulfillment tracking, and admin order oversight. It integrates with
   * the order lifecycle management system and provides foundation for order
   * tracking, cancellation workflows, and refund request identification.
   *
   * Performance requirements specify that search results must be returned
   * within 1-2 seconds for datasets up to 100,000 orders. The operation
   * supports sorting by order date, total amount, status, and other relevant
   * fields. Pagination is implemented to handle large result sets efficiently,
   * with configurable page sizes typically ranging from 10-50 orders per page.
   *
   * Related operations include GET /orders/{orderId} for detailed order
   * information and order-specific action endpoints for cancellation and refund
   * requests. This search operation serves as the entry point for users to
   * locate specific orders before drilling down into details.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria, filtering parameters, sorting options, and
   *   pagination controls for order retrieval. Includes filters for order
   *   status, date ranges, customer/seller identifiers, price ranges, and
   *   full-text search terms.

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific order from the
   * shopping_mall_orders table.
   *
   * Retrieve complete detailed information for a specific order identified by
   * the orderId path parameter from the shopping_mall_orders table. This
   * operation returns comprehensive order data including order metadata,
   * itemized product list with SKU details and pricing, delivery address
   * snapshot preserved at checkout time, shipping method and costs, tax
   * calculations, payment information, order status with complete lifecycle
   * timeline, and related entities such as shipment tracking, cancellation
   * records, and refund requests.
   *
   * The operation serves multiple use cases across different user roles.
   * Customers access this endpoint to view their order details, track shipping
   * status, review purchased items, and initiate cancellation or refund
   * requests. Sellers access this endpoint to view orders they need to fulfill,
   * retrieve customer shipping addresses, and update order processing status.
   * Admins access this endpoint for comprehensive order oversight, dispute
   * resolution, and customer service support.
   *
   * Authorization is strictly enforced based on user role and ownership:
   * customers can only retrieve their own orders (where
   * shopping_mall_customer_id matches authenticated customer), sellers can only
   * retrieve orders containing their products (where shopping_mall_seller_id
   * matches authenticated seller), and admins have unrestricted access to all
   * orders. Attempting to access an order without proper authorization returns
   * a 403 Forbidden error.
   *
   * The response includes complete order information structured for detailed
   * display: order header with order_number, status, timestamps (created_at,
   * payment_confirmed_at, seller_confirmed_at, shipped_at, delivered_at,
   * completed_at, cancelled_at), financial breakdown (subtotal from
   * order_items, shipping_cost, tax_amount, total_amount), delivery address
   * details (snapshotted from checkout time), customer contact information,
   * seller information, and shipping method selection.
   *
   * Order items are returned with full detail including product_name
   * (snapshotted), variant_attributes (color, size, options as JSON),
   * product_image_url (snapshotted), quantity, unit_price (at time of
   * purchase), and individual item_status for partial fulfillment tracking.
   * This enables accurate historical display even if products are later
   * modified or discontinued.
   *
   * Shipping information includes carrier tracking integration: carrier_name,
   * tracking_number with validation, shipment_status (label_created, picked_up,
   * in_transit, out_for_delivery, delivered, exception), shipped_at timestamp,
   * estimated_delivery_date, and actual_delivery_date when available. The order
   * status history provides a complete audit trail with all state transitions,
   * timestamps, and actors (customer, seller, admin, or system) who triggered
   * each change.
   *
   * For cancelled orders, the response includes cancellation details from
   * shopping_mall_cancellations: requester identification (customer, seller, or
   * admin), cancellation_reason, cancellation_status, refund_amount,
   * refund_processed flag, and timestamps. For orders with refund requests, the
   * response includes refund request details from
   * shopping_mall_refund_requests: refund_reason, refund_description,
   * refund_amount_requested, refund_amount_approved, refund_status,
   * return_required flag, and review timeline.
   *
   * This operation is essential for order tracking workflows defined in the
   * Order Management and Tracking requirements document. It provides the
   * complete order context needed for customers to track deliveries, for
   * sellers to fulfill orders, and for admins to resolve disputes and manage
   * refunds. The detailed order view serves as the basis for order-related
   * actions including cancellation requests, refund requests, review
   * submissions, and customer service inquiries.
   *
   * Performance expectations require the order detail page to load within 1
   * second under normal conditions. The operation retrieves data from multiple
   * related tables (orders, order_items, shipments, cancellations,
   * refund_requests, order_status_history) and should optimize queries to
   * minimize database round trips while maintaining response time targets.
   *
   * Error handling includes returning 404 Not Found when the orderId does not
   * exist, 403 Forbidden when the authenticated user lacks permission to view
   * the order, and appropriate error messages for any data retrieval issues.
   * The operation handles soft-deleted orders by excluding them from results
   * unless specifically requested by admins for audit purposes.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param orderId Unique identifier of the target order to retrieve. Must be a
   *   valid UUID matching an existing order in the shopping_mall_orders table.
