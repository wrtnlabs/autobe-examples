  /**
   * Search and filter SKU variants for a specific product in shopping_mall_skus
   * table.
   *
   * This operation retrieves a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of
   * SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) variants associated with a specific product from
   * the shopping_mall_skus table. SKUs represent individual product variants
   * with unique combinations of attributes such as color, size, and custom
   * options, each maintaining independent pricing and inventory tracking.
   *
   * The endpoint supports advanced filtering capabilities enabling users to
   * narrow down SKU variants based on multiple criteria. Filters include
   * variant attributes (specific colors, sizes, or custom options), price
   * ranges, inventory availability (in stock, low stock, out of stock), and SKU
   * activity status. This flexible filtering is essential for both
   * customer-facing product displays and seller inventory management
   * interfaces.
   *
   * Each SKU in the response includes complete variant information: the unique
   * SKU code, associated variant attributes (color name and hex code if
   * applicable, size value and category, custom option name and value), current
   * pricing, inventory levels (available quantity, reserved quantity for
   * pending orders, and low stock threshold), and availability status (active
   * or inactive). This comprehensive data enables accurate product variant
   * selection by customers and detailed inventory monitoring by sellers.
   *
   * The operation implements pagination to handle products with numerous
   * variants efficiently. Pagination parameters include page number, page size
   * (default 20, maximum 100 variants per page), and sorting options. Sort
   * capabilities include sorting by price (ascending or descending), available
   * quantity (to identify low-stock variants), SKU code alphabetically, or
   * creation date (newest or oldest first).
   *
   * Security and authorization considerations are critical for this endpoint.
   * Customers and public users can view only active SKUs with their pricing and
   * availability to support purchasing decisions. Sellers can view all their
   * product SKUs including inactive variants, reserved inventory quantities,
   * and comprehensive stock details for inventory management. Admins have full
   * visibility across all SKU data for any product on the platform for
   * moderation and oversight purposes.
   *
   * This endpoint directly references the shopping_mall_skus table structure
   * from the Prisma schema, including foreign key relationships to
   * shopping_mall_products (parent product), shopping_mall_sku_colors (color
   * variant), shopping_mall_sku_sizes (size variant), and
   * shopping_mall_sku_options (custom option variant). The response accurately
   * reflects these relationships by including denormalized variant attribute
   * details for efficient display.
   *
   * Performance requirements mandate that this operation returns results within
   * 500 milliseconds even for products with hundreds of variants. The
   * implementation should leverage database indexing on foreign keys, composite
   * indexes on product_id with is_active status, and efficient pagination
   * strategies to meet these performance targets.
   *

   * @param productId Unique identifier of the parent product whose SKU variants

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific product SKU variant.
   *
   * Retrieve comprehensive details for a specific product variant (SKU)
   * identified by its unique SKU ID within the context of a parent product.
   * This operation provides all information necessary for customers to make
   * informed purchase decisions about a specific product variant.
   *
   * The SKU represents a Stock Keeping Unit with a unique combination of
   * variant attributes such as color, size, and custom options. Each SKU has
   * independent pricing that may differ from the base product price, allowing
   * sellers to charge different amounts for different sizes, colors, or
   * configurations. The SKU also maintains its own inventory tracking with
   * available_quantity and reserved_quantity fields.
   *
   * This endpoint returns complete SKU information including the SKU code
   * (unique identifier), current price, stock availability status (in stock,
   * low stock, out of stock based on available_quantity), low stock threshold
   * configuration, and whether the SKU is currently active for purchase. The
   * response includes references to variant attribute entities
   * (shopping_mall_sku_colors, shopping_mall_sku_sizes,
   * shopping_mall_sku_options) that define the specific variant combination.
   *
   * Customers use this information to understand exactly which product variant
   * they are viewing, check its availability, and see the specific price for
   * their selected combination of attributes. The inventory information helps
   * customers make immediate purchase decisions by showing real-time stock
   * status.
   *
   * Security considerations include validating that the SKU belongs to the
   * specified product to prevent unauthorized access to SKU details from
   * unrelated products. The operation is publicly accessible as customers need
   * to view SKU details during product browsing without authentication.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the shopping_mall_products table to verify
   * the parent product relationship and with variant attribute tables to
   * provide complete variant descriptions. Performance is critical as customers
   * frequently switch between variants on product pages, requiring sub-second
   * response times.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param productId Unique identifier of the parent product containing the SKU
   *   variant
   * @param skuId Unique identifier of the specific SKU variant to retrieve
