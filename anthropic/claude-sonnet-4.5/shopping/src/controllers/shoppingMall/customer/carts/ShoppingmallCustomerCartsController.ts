  /**
   * Retrieve complete shopping cart details for a specific cart by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve comprehensive details of a specific shopping cart identified by
   * its unique cart ID from the shopping_mall_carts table. This operation
   * returns complete cart information including all associated cart items from
   * shopping_mall_cart_items, with full product and SKU details, current
   * pricing, inventory availability, and calculated totals.
   *
   * The operation enforces ownership-based access control by validating that
   * the authenticated customer owns the requested cart. Customers can only
   * access their own carts, preventing unauthorized access to other users'
   * shopping cart data. The cart ID must match a cart belonging to the
   * authenticated customer's account.
   *
   * This endpoint provides real-time cart data essential for cart page display,
   * checkout initiation, and cart synchronization across devices. The response
   * includes current SKU pricing and availability status, enabling the frontend
   * to display accurate information and handle scenarios where prices have
   * changed or items have become unavailable since being added to the cart.
   *
   * The cart details include grouping of items by seller to support
   * multi-seller order visualization, showing which products will be fulfilled
   * by which sellers. This grouping is critical for displaying shipping costs
   * per seller and preparing customers for potential multiple shipments from a
   * single checkout.
   *
   * Integration with the product catalog ensures that returned cart items
   * include up-to-date product names, images, and SKU variant details even if
   * the underlying product information has been updated since items were added
   * to the cart. Deleted or discontinued products are flagged appropriately,
   * allowing the frontend to prompt customers to remove unavailable items.
   *
   * The operation calculates cart subtotals, estimated taxes (if delivery
   * address is available), and potential shipping costs (if shipping methods
   * are pre-selected), providing customers with a comprehensive view of their
   * pending purchase total. Price change notifications are included when SKU
   * prices have changed since items were added.
   *
   * This is a read-only operation that does not modify cart state, inventory
   * reservations, or user data. It serves as the primary cart detail retrieval
   * endpoint for customer cart management workflows.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param cartId Unique identifier of the shopping cart to retrieve

  /**
   * Clear all items from the shopping cart and mark cart as deleted.
   *
   * This operation clears the entire shopping cart by removing all cart items
   * and marking the cart record as deleted. It provides a convenient way for
   * customers to start fresh with an empty cart without manually removing each
   * item individually.
   *
   * The operation first validates that the shopping cart identified by cartId
   * belongs to the authenticated customer. This ownership validation is
   * critical for security, preventing customers from clearing other customers'
   * carts. If the cart does not belong to the authenticated customer or does
   * not exist, the operation returns an appropriate error response.
   *
   * When the validation passes, the operation performs multiple coordinated
   * actions. First, it retrieves all cart items associated with the cart from
   * the shopping_mall_cart_items table. For each cart item, the system
   * calculates the total reserved quantity (item quantity) and releases the
   * inventory reservation by updating the corresponding SKU record in the
   * shopping_mall_skus table. The reserved_quantity is decreased and the
   * available_quantity is increased for each SKU that was in the cart.
   *
   * Each inventory release operation is recorded in the
   * shopping_mall_inventory_transactions table with transaction_type set to
   * 'reservation_release', transaction_status set to 'completed', and
   * quantity_change reflecting the returned quantity. This maintains a complete
   * audit trail of all inventory movements as required by the business rules.
   *
   * After releasing all inventory reservations, the operation permanently
   * deletes all shopping_mall_cart_items records associated with the cart.
   * Then, it performs a soft deletion on the shopping_mall_carts record by
   * setting the deleted_at timestamp to the current time. Soft deletion
   * preserves the cart record for analytics and audit purposes while marking it
   * as inactive. According to the Prisma schema, the unique constraint on
   * shopping_mall_carts includes the deleted_at column, allowing customers to
   * create new carts after clearing previous ones.
   *
   * This operation is typically used when customers want to completely clear
   * their cart to start over, when they decide not to proceed with their
   * current selections, or when they want to begin a new shopping session. It
   * provides a clean slate without requiring individual item removal
   * operations.
   *
   * The operation returns a success response with no content upon successful
   * completion. All inventory updates, transaction logging, and cart deletion
   * are performed atomically to maintain data consistency. If any part of the
   * operation fails, the entire operation is rolled back to prevent partial
   * cart clearing or inventory inconsistencies.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the shopping cart business rules defined in
   * the requirements analysis, specifically the cart persistence rules and
   * inventory reservation management. It ensures that clearing a cart properly
   * releases all inventory back to the available pool, maintaining accurate
   * stock levels for other customers.
