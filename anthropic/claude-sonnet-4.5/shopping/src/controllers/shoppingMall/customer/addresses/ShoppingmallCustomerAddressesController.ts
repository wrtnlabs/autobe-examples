   * If this is the customer's first address, the system automatically sets
   * is_default to true. If the customer already has addresses and the request
   * specifies is_default as true, the system updates the previous default
   * address to remove its default status. Customers can optionally provide a
   * label for the address (such as 'Home', 'Office') which must be unique per
   * customer.
   *
   * The address is initially marked as unverified (is_verified=false) and can
   * be verified through an address validation service integration after

   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of delivery addresses.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive list of delivery addresses with advanced
   * filtering, searching, sorting, and pagination capabilities. This operation
   * provides full address search functionality for authenticated users to
   * manage their saved delivery addresses efficiently.
   *
   * This endpoint operates on the shopping_mall_addresses table which stores
   * delivery addresses for customers, sellers, and admins using a polymorphic
   * user ownership pattern. Each address contains complete delivery information
   * including recipient details, phone number, multi-line street address, city,
   * state/province, postal code, country data, verification status, default
   * designation, and optional user-defined labels.
   *
   * Security and authorization are enforced based on the authenticated user's
   * role. Customers can only retrieve their own addresses by filtering on their
   * customer_id. Sellers can only retrieve their own addresses by filtering on
   * their seller_id. Admins have platform-wide access and can retrieve
   * addresses for any user across all user types, enabling administrative
   * address management and customer support functions.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive filtering capabilities including user
   * type discrimination (customer, seller, admin), country-based filtering,
   * verification status (is_verified), default address filtering (is_default),
   * postal code searches, city and state filtering, and soft deletion status
   * (deleted_at). This enables users to find specific addresses quickly and
   * admins to perform advanced address data analysis.
   *
   * Pagination is implemented to handle users with multiple saved addresses
   * efficiently. The response includes total count, current page number, page
   * size, and the array of address records matching the filter criteria.
   * Sorting options include chronological ordering (created_at, updated_at),
   * alphabetical ordering by recipient name or city, and custom ordering by
   * verification status or default designation.
   *
   * Address data returned includes all fields from the Prisma schema:
   * recipient_name, phone_number, address_line1, address_line2 (optional),
   * city, state_province, postal_code, country, country_code, is_default, label
   * (optional), is_verified, verified_at timestamp, and soft deletion timestamp
   * deleted_at. The user_type discriminator field indicates ownership type
   * (customer, seller, admin) and the corresponding user foreign key
   * (shopping_mall_customer_id, shopping_mall_seller_id, or
   * shopping_mall_admin_id) identifies the owner.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the order placement and checkout processes
   * where customers select delivery addresses. Addresses are preserved as
   * snapshots in completed orders even when the user later updates or deletes
   * the address record, maintaining historical accuracy for order fulfillment
   * and customer service.
   *
   * Related operations include retrieving individual address details (GET

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific delivery address by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve complete details for a specific delivery address identified by the
   * addressId path parameter. This operation returns comprehensive address
   * information including recipient details, complete street address
   * components, verification status, default address designation, and user
   * ownership data.
   *
   * This endpoint operates on the shopping_mall_addresses table which
   * implements polymorphic user ownership supporting customers, sellers, and
   * admins. Each address record contains recipient_name, phone_number,
   * address_line1, address_line2 (optional apartment/suite information), city,
   * state_province, postal_code, country, country_code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2),
   * is_default flag, optional user-defined label, verification status
   * (is_verified), verification timestamp (verified_at), and soft deletion
   * status (deleted_at).
   *
   * Strict authorization and ownership verification are enforced to protect
   * address privacy. Customers can only retrieve addresses where
   * shopping_mall_customer_id matches their authenticated user ID. Sellers can
   * only retrieve addresses where shopping_mall_seller_id matches their
   * authenticated user ID. Admins have platform-wide access and can retrieve
   * any address regardless of ownership for customer support, dispute
   * resolution, and administrative functions.
   *
   * The addressId path parameter must be a valid UUID format matching an
   * existing record in the shopping_mall_addresses table. The operation
   * validates that the address exists and performs ownership verification
   * before returning data. If the address does not exist or the authenticated
   * user does not have permission to access it, appropriate error responses are
   * returned (404 Not Found for non-existent addresses, 403 Forbidden for
   * unauthorized access attempts).
   *
   * The response includes the complete address record with all fields from the
   * Prisma schema. The user_type field (values: customer, seller, admin)
   * indicates the ownership type, and the corresponding foreign key field
   * (shopping_mall_customer_id, shopping_mall_seller_id, or
   * shopping_mall_admin_id) identifies the specific owner. This polymorphic
   * pattern enables unified address management across all user types while
   * maintaining clear ownership boundaries.
   *
   * Address data returned includes verification metadata showing whether the
   * address has been validated through an address verification service
   * (is_verified) and when verification occurred (verified_at). Verified
   * addresses provide higher confidence for order delivery and reduce shipping
   * errors. Unverified addresses may prompt customers to confirm accuracy
   * during checkout.
   *
   * The is_default field indicates whether this is the user's default delivery
   * address, which is pre-selected during checkout for convenience. Only one
   * address per user should be marked as default. The optional label field
   * allows users to assign friendly names like 'Home', 'Office', 'Parents
   * House' for quick identification.
   *
   * This operation integrates with checkout and order management workflows
   * where customers select delivery addresses for order fulfillment. When
   * orders are placed, the complete address is snapshotted and stored with the
   * order record, preserving historical accuracy even if the user later updates
   * or deletes the address. This ensures order history displays the correct
   * delivery destination for all past orders.
   *
   * The soft deletion pattern (deleted_at timestamp) allows users to remove
   * addresses from their active list while preserving the data for historical
   * order references. Deleted addresses are filtered out from normal address
   * selection interfaces but remain accessible for order history display and
   * audit purposes.
   *
   * Related operations include searching and listing addresses (PATCH
   * /addresses), creating new addresses (POST /addresses), updating address
   * details (PUT /addresses/{addressId}), and deleting addresses (DELETE
   * /addresses/{addressId}).

   * The soft delete approach preserves historical references from completed
