   * Submit a new product review with rating and optional feedback from verified
   * purchaser.
   *
   * Create a new product review for a purchased product, allowing verified
   * customers to share their experience and provide feedback. This operation
   * inserts a new record into the shopping_mall_reviews table with
   * comprehensive validation of customer eligibility, purchase verification,
   * and content quality requirements.
   *
   * The review submission process enforces critical business rules defined in
   * the requirements: only customers who have received the product in a
   * completed order (status='delivered') are eligible to review, ensuring
   * authentic feedback from verified purchasers. The system validates that the
   * customer has not already reviewed the same product by checking for existing
   * reviews from the same customer_id and product_id combination, as each
   * customer can submit only one review per product.
   *
   * The mandatory star rating must be an integer from 1 to 5, where 1=Terrible,
   * 2=Poor, 3=Average, 4=Very Good, 5=Excellent. The review text is optional,
   * allowing customers to submit rating-only reviews for quick feedback. When
   * text is provided, it must meet minimum quality standards: at least 10
   * characters for meaningful content, maximum 5000 characters, no profanity or
   * offensive language, no personal contact information or external URLs. The
   * optional review title provides a short summary limited to 100 characters.
   *
   * Customers can optionally upload up to 5 product images (JPEG, PNG, WebP
   * formats, 5MB maximum per image, minimum 400x400 pixels resolution) to
   * provide visual evidence and context. These images are particularly valuable
   * for reviews of defective or damaged products and enhance review helpfulness
   * for other customers.
   *
   * All submitted reviews enter a moderation workflow with initial
   * status='pending_moderation'. The system automatically flags reviews for
   * manual moderation if they contain potentially offensive language, very
   * negative ratings (1-2 stars), competitor mentions, or contact information
   * patterns. Reviews without moderation flags may be auto-approved for
   * customers with good review history. The moderation workflow ensures review
   * quality and policy compliance before publication.
   *
   * The operation automatically sets verified_purchase=true since only verified
   * purchasers can access this endpoint, and the verified purchase badge is
   * displayed with all reviews to build trust. The review is associated with
   * the specific order that enabled the review for audit trail and eligibility
   * validation.
   *
   * Upon successful submission, the system sends confirmation notification to
   * the customer, notifies the seller of the new review, and returns the
   * created review details including the assigned review ID and moderation
   * status.
   *
   * Related operations that customers may use in conjunction include retrieving
   * product reviews to read others' feedback before writing their own, editing
   * submitted reviews within the 30-day window, and voting on other reviews'
   * helpfulness. Sellers can respond to published reviews through dedicated
   * seller response endpoints.

  /**
   * Update an existing product review within 30-day edit window.
   *
   * Enables customers to modify their previously submitted product reviews
   * including star rating, title, review text, and uploaded images. This
   * operation is restricted to the original review author and must be performed
   * within 30 days of the original submission date as per platform business
   * rules.
   *
   * The review update process validates several critical conditions before
   * allowing modifications. First, the system verifies that the authenticated
   * customer is the original author of the review by comparing the customer ID
   * from the JWT token with the shopping_mall_customer_id in the review record.
   * Second, the system checks that the current date is within 30 days of the
   * review's created_at timestamp. Reviews older than 30 days are locked and
   * cannot be edited, requiring customers to contact support for exceptional
   * cases.
   *
   * When a customer updates a review, all modified content is re-submitted to
   * the moderation workflow. The review status transitions to
   * 'pending_moderation' and requires admin approval before the updated content
   * becomes visible to other customers. This ensures that edited reviews
   * maintain the same quality standards as new submissions. The system
   * validates the updated content against the same rules as new reviews:
   * minimum 10 characters for review text, maximum 5000 characters, no
   * prohibited content (profanity, personal information, external URLs), and
   * proper image formats for uploaded photos.
   *
   * The updated_at timestamp is automatically set to the current time, and the
   * review receives an 'edited' badge that displays the last modification date
   * to other customers. This transparency helps maintain trust in the review
   * ecosystem. The edit history is preserved in audit logs accessible only to
   * administrators for moderation and dispute resolution purposes.
   *
   * Upon successful update, the system recalculates aggregate product ratings
   * if the star rating was modified, updates the review's helpful_count if
   * necessary, and sends a notification to the seller of the reviewed product.
   * The customer receives confirmation that their updated review is pending
   * moderation and will be published after admin approval.

  /**
   * Soft delete a customer's product review with immediate effect.
   *
   * Enables customers to remove their previously submitted product reviews from
   * public visibility. This operation performs a soft deletion, setting the
   * deleted_at timestamp in the shopping_mall_reviews table while preserving
   * the review data for audit trails and historical compliance.
   *
   * The deletion process first validates that the authenticated customer owns
   * the review being deleted. The system compares the customer ID from the JWT
   * authentication token with the shopping_mall_customer_id field in the review
   * record. If the review belongs to a different customer, the operation
   * returns a 403 Forbidden error, preventing unauthorized deletion attempts.
   *
   * Upon successful validation, the system performs several critical operations
   * atomically. First, the deleted_at timestamp is set to the current date and
   * time, marking the review as deleted. Second, the product's aggregate rating
   * statistics are immediately recalculated, removing this review's star rating
   * from the average rating calculation and decrementing the total review count
   * displayed on the product page. This ensures that product ratings accurately
   * reflect only active, visible reviews.
   *
   * The system also handles related data cleanup. Any helpfulness votes on this
   * review (from the shopping_mall_review_helpfulness_votes table) are retained
   * for audit purposes but excluded from public helpful count displays. If a
   * seller had posted a response to this review
   * (shopping_mall_seller_responses), the response is also soft-deleted in
   * cascade to maintain data consistency.
   *
   * A notification is sent to the seller of the reviewed product, informing
   * them that a review has been removed. This helps sellers track changes to
   * their product feedback. The customer receives confirmation that their
   * review has been successfully deleted.
   *
   * The soft deletion approach maintains referential integrity with the
   * shopping_mall_orders table, preserving the historical link between the
   * order that enabled the verified purchase review and the now-deleted review
   * record. This is essential for audit trails and compliance with data
   * retention policies while respecting customer privacy and control over their
   * contributed content.

  /**
   * Cast or update helpfulness vote on a product review.
   *
   * Records a customer's vote indicating whether a product review was helpful
   * or not helpful, operating on the shopping_mall_review_helpfulness_votes
   * table in the Reviews namespace. This voting mechanism helps surface the
   * most useful reviews by allowing the community to collectively identify
   * which reviews provide the most value to future shoppers.
   *
   * The endpoint supports the core review helpfulness voting system where any
   * authenticated customer can vote on any published review, regardless of
   * whether they have purchased the product themselves. This inclusive voting
   * policy enables a broader community to participate in identifying
   * high-quality, informative reviews. Each customer can cast exactly one vote
   * per review, implemented through a unique constraint on the combination of
   * review ID and customer ID.
   *
   * When a customer votes on a review they have previously voted on, the system
   * updates the existing vote record rather than creating a duplicate. This
   * allows customers to change their minds and update their vote from 'helpful'
   * to 'not helpful' or vice versa. The updated_at timestamp tracks when votes
   * were changed, providing audit capability for vote manipulation detection.
   *
   * The operation enforces a critical business rule: reviewers cannot vote on
   * their own reviews. This prevents self-promotion and maintains voting
   * integrity. The system validates that the authenticated customer ID does not
   * match the review author's customer ID before accepting the vote.
   *
   * Helpful vote counts are aggregated and displayed publicly on each review,
   * contributing to the 'Most Helpful' sorting algorithm which ranks reviews by
   * net helpful votes (helpful votes minus not-helpful votes). Reviews with
   * higher helpful counts appear first when customers sort by 'Most Helpful',
   * directly influencing which feedback is most prominently featured.
   *
   * Not-helpful votes are recorded in the database but are not publicly
   * displayed to customers to avoid creating negative sentiment around reviews.
   * These votes still contribute to the internal helpfulness score calculation
   * and can inform admins about potentially problematic reviews that receive
   * high not-helpful vote counts.
   *
   * The voting system integrates with review moderation workflows - reviews
   * that receive unusually high not-helpful vote counts may be flagged for
   * admin review to verify they meet content quality standards. The system also
   * monitors for suspicious voting patterns such as coordinated voting from new
   * accounts, which could indicate vote manipulation attempts.
   *
   * Related operations include review retrieval endpoints that display helpful
   * vote counts and implement 'Most Helpful' sorting, and review moderation
   * endpoints that use voting patterns as quality signals.
