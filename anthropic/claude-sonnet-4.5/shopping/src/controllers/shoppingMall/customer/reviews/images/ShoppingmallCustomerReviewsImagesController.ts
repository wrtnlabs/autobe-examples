  /**
   * Upload and attach new images to a specific product review.
   *
   * Upload one or more product images to be associated with the specified
   * review, supporting customer-provided visual evidence and context for their
   * product feedback. This operation enables customers to enhance their written
   * reviews with photographic documentation of the product's appearance,
   * quality, defects, or usage scenarios.
   *
   * The operation validates that the requesting customer is the owner of the
   * review identified by reviewId, ensuring only the review author can upload
   * images to their own review. The review must be in an editable state (within
   * 30 days of creation) and not in deleted or permanently locked status.
   *
   * Image validation includes comprehensive checks for file format (JPEG, PNG,
   * WebP only), file size constraints (maximum 5MB per image), minimum
   * resolution requirements (800x800 pixels recommended for quality), and
   * content appropriateness through automated scanning. The operation enforces
   * a strict limit of 5 images per review as defined in the business
   * requirements, rejecting upload attempts that would exceed this threshold.
   *
   * Upon successful validation, the system processes uploaded images by
   * generating multiple optimized versions including thumbnails (150x150 pixels
   * for review lists), medium resolution (600x600 pixels for review detail
   * pages), and preserving original high-resolution versions for zoom
   * functionality. Images are assigned sequential display_order values based on
   * upload sequence, which customers can later reorder through review editing
   * functionality.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the review moderation workflow, where newly
   * uploaded images to pending reviews are included in the moderation queue for
   * content policy compliance review. Images uploaded to already-approved
   * reviews may trigger re-moderation depending on platform policy
   * configuration.
   *
   * Security considerations include authentication verification to confirm the
   * requesting user is the review author, authorization checks to prevent
   * unauthorized image uploads to other users' reviews, rate limiting to
   * prevent abuse (maximum 10 upload operations per hour per customer), and
   * virus scanning for uploaded files to protect platform integrity.
   *
   * Related operations that customers typically use in conjunction with this
   * endpoint include review creation (POST /reviews), review editing (PUT
   * /reviews/{reviewId}), and review image reordering during the edit workflow.
   * Sellers and admins viewing customer reviews also retrieve these images
   * through review detail endpoints to assess product feedback quality and
   * authenticity.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param reviewId Unique identifier of the target product review to which
   *   images will be attached
   * @param body Image upload data including image files, display order
   *   preferences, and optional alt text for accessibility

  /**
   * Permanently delete a specific image from a product review.
   *
   * Removes a customer-uploaded image from a product review, operating on the
   * shopping_mall_review_images table in the Reviews namespace. This endpoint
   * serves two primary use cases: allowing customers to remove images they
   * uploaded to their own reviews, and enabling admins to remove inappropriate
   * images during content moderation workflows.
   *
   * Customers can upload up to 5 images per review (JPEG, PNG, WebP formats,
   * 5MB max per image) to provide visual evidence and context for their product
   * feedback. These images are particularly valuable for reviews involving
   * defective or damaged products, helping other customers make informed
   * purchase decisions. This deletion endpoint provides customers with control
   * over their submitted media content.
   *
   * The operation performs a permanent hard delete as the
   * shopping_mall_review_images table does not include a deleted_at column.
   * When an image is removed, the record is completely deleted from the
   * database. The system automatically recalculates the display_order values
   * for remaining images in the review to maintain sequential ordering (1, 2,
   * 3...) without gaps.
   *
   * Business rules enforced by this operation include verification that the
   * requesting user has appropriate permissions (review author for
   * customer-initiated deletions, or admin role for moderation-initiated
   * deletions). The operation validates that both the review and the image
   * exist and that the image actually belongs to the specified review before
   * proceeding with deletion.
   *
   * Related operations that work together with this endpoint include the review
   * creation and update endpoints that initially upload and manage review
   * images, and the review retrieval endpoints that display the remaining
   * images after deletion. The review moderation workflow also uses this
   * endpoint when admins identify policy-violating image content that must be
   * removed.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param reviewId Unique identifier of the parent product review containing
   *   the image to be deleted
   * @param imageId Unique identifier of the specific review image to be
   *   permanently removed
