  /**
   * Request password reset email with secure token link
   * (shopping_mall_customers table).
   *
   * Initiates the password reset process for customers who have forgotten their
   * password by generating a secure password reset token and sending a reset
   * link to the customer's registered email address. This operation implements
   * the password reset flow defined in the Password Management section of the
   * User Roles and Authentication requirements document.
   *
   * When a customer provides their email address to request password reset, the
   * system queries the shopping_mall_customers table to determine if an account
   * exists with that email. For security purposes following best practices to
   * prevent account enumeration, the system returns a generic success message
   * regardless of whether the email exists: 'If an account exists with that
   * email address, you will receive password reset instructions.' This prevents
   * attackers from determining which email addresses are registered on the
   * platform.
   *
   * If a customer account is found matching the provided email, the system
   * generates a cryptographically secure random token of at least 32 bytes for
   * the password reset. This token is stored in the password_reset_token field
   * of the shopping_mall_customers table. The system also calculates and stores
   * the expiration timestamp in password_reset_expires_at, set to 1 hour from
   * the current time as specified in the business rules. If a previous
   * password_reset_token exists and has not yet expired, the system invalidates
   * it by generating a new token, ensuring only one active reset token per
   * customer at any time.
   *
   * The system constructs a password reset email containing a secure link in
   * format:
   * https://platform-url/auth/customer/password/reset?token={password_reset_token}.
   * The email is sent to the customer's registered email address with subject
   * 'Password Reset Request for Shopping Mall Account' and body explaining the
   * reset process, token expiration (1 hour), and security warning that the
   * link should not be shared. The email includes customer service contact
   * information for customers who did not request the reset. The system
   * implements rate limiting allowing maximum 3 password reset requests per
   * hour per email address to prevent abuse.
   *
   * This operation does not require authentication (publicly accessible
   * endpoint) as it serves customers who cannot log in. The response is always
   * a success message regardless of email existence, maintaining security while
   * providing a user-friendly experience. Customers who receive the email can
   * click the link to proceed to the password reset completion endpoint where
   * they provide a new password. If the customer does not receive the email
   * within a few minutes, they can retry the request, and the system will
   * generate a new token with a fresh 1-hour expiration window.
