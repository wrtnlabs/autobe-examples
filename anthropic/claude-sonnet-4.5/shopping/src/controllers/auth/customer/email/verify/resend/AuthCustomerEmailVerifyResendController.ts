  /**
   * Resend verification email with new token for unverified customer accounts
   * (shopping_mall_customers table).
   *
   * Resends the email verification link to customers who did not receive the
   * original verification email or whose verification token has expired. This
   * operation implements the verification email resend functionality defined in
   * the Email Verification section of the User Roles and Authentication
   * requirements, supporting customers who need a new verification link.
   *
   * When a customer requests a new verification email by providing their email
   * address, the system queries the shopping_mall_customers table to find a
   * customer record matching the provided email. If no customer exists with
   * that email, the system returns a generic success message 'If your email is
   * registered and unverified, you will receive a new verification link'
   * without revealing whether the account exists (following security best
   * practice to prevent account enumeration).
   *
   * For existing customer accounts, the system validates the account is
   * eligible for verification email resend by checking: (1) email_verified is
   * false (verified accounts don't need new verification emails), (2)
   * account_status is 'unverified' or 'active' (suspended or deleted accounts
   * cannot receive verification emails). If the account is already verified,
   * the system returns error 'This email address has already been verified. You
   * can log in to your account.'
   *
   * The system enforces rate limiting as specified in the business rules
   * allowing maximum 1 verification email resend per 5 minutes per customer.
   * This is validated by checking the email_verification_sent_at timestamp and
   * comparing it to current time. If less than 5 minutes have passed since the
   * last verification email was sent (email_verification_sent_at + 5 minutes >
   * current time), the system returns HTTP 429 error 'Verification email was
   * recently sent. Please wait a few minutes before requesting another one.'
   * This prevents abuse and email system overload.
   *
   * If rate limiting validation passes, the system generates a new
   * cryptographically secure email_verification_token (unique random string)
   * and sets a new expiration time of 24 hours from the current timestamp. The
   * token is stored in the email_verification_token field, and
   * email_verification_sent_at is updated to the current timestamp. The system
   * queues a verification email containing a link in format:
   * https://platform-url/auth/customer/email/verify?token={email_verification_token}.
   * The email explains the verification process, token expiration (24 hours),
   * and provides instructions for completing verification.
   *
   * The operation returns a generic success response 'If your email is
   * registered and unverified, you will receive a new verification link' to
   * avoid revealing account information while providing a user-friendly
   * confirmation message. The customer should check their email inbox (and spam
   * folder) for the verification link. The new token expires 24 hours from
   * issuance, replacing any previous unexpired tokens. Once the customer clicks
   * the verification link and the verifyEmail endpoint processes the token,
   * their account transitions from 'unverified' to 'active' status with
   * email_verified set to true, granting access to full platform features.
