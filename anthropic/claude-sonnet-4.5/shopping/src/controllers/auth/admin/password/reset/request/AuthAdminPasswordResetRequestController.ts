  /**
   * Request admin password reset token and email.
   *
   * Initiates the admin password reset workflow by generating a secure reset
   * token and sending reset instructions via email. This endpoint implements
   * the account recovery process for admin users who have forgotten their
   * password or need to reset it for security reasons.
   *
   * The password reset request process begins when an admin provides their
   * registered email address. The system validates the email format to ensure
   * it's a properly structured email address. If the format is invalid, the
   * request is rejected with a validation error.
   *
   * The system queries the shopping_mall_admins table to check if an admin
   * account exists with the provided email address. For security reasons, the
   * system returns the same generic success message whether or not the email
   * exists: 'If an account exists with this email, you will receive password
   * reset instructions.' This prevents attackers from using the endpoint to
   * enumerate valid admin email addresses.
   *
   * If an admin account is found with the provided email, the system implements
   * rate limiting to prevent abuse. It checks if the admin has requested
   * password resets recently by examining the email_verification_sent_at
   * timestamp (which is reused for tracking reset request timing). If the admin
   * has already requested 3 password resets within the last hour, the request
   * is denied (though the generic success message is still returned to prevent
   * enumeration).
   *
   * The system generates a cryptographically secure random token of at least 32
   * bytes (256 bits) using a secure random number generator. This token serves
   * as the password_reset_token and is stored in the admin's record. The
   * password_reset_expires_at field is set to exactly 1 hour from the current
   * timestamp, enforcing the 1-hour expiration window specified in the business
   * requirements.
   *
   * A password reset email is sent to the admin's email address using the
   * platform's email notification system. The email contains a secure reset
   * link in the format:
   * https://platform.com/auth/admin/reset-password?token=[password_reset_token].
   * The email also includes security information explaining that if the admin
   * did not request this reset, they should ignore the email and contact
   * support if they have concerns.
   *
   * The password_reset_token can be used only once. After successful password
   * reset (via a separate endpoint), the token is cleared (set to null) to
   * prevent reuse. If the admin doesn't use the token within 1 hour, it expires
   * and a new reset request is required.
   *
   * The system logs all password reset requests with timestamp, IP address, and
   * email for security auditing and fraud detection. Multiple reset requests
   * from unusual IP addresses or patterns trigger security alerts for
   * investigation.
   *
   * The response returns a generic success message and does not reveal whether
   * the email address corresponds to an actual admin account, maintaining
   * security against email enumeration attacks.
