# Product Reviews and Ratings - Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Business Context

The product review and rating system is a critical component of the e-commerce shopping mall platform that enables customers to share their experiences and provide feedback on purchased products. This system serves multiple business objectives:

- **Trust Building**: Authentic customer reviews build credibility and trust in the marketplace
- **Purchase Decision Support**: Ratings and reviews help potential customers make informed purchasing decisions
- **Seller Accountability**: Reviews provide feedback to sellers about product quality and customer satisfaction
- **Platform Quality Control**: Review data helps identify problematic products or sellers
- **Customer Engagement**: The review system encourages ongoing customer interaction with the platform

The review system integrates closely with the order management system to ensure only verified purchasers can submit reviews, maintaining review authenticity and credibility. All reviews are associated with specific product SKUs and contribute to product-level aggregate ratings displayed throughout the catalog.
