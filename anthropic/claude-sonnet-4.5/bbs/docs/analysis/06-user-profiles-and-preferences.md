# User Profiles and Preferences

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive requirements for user profile management and personalization features in the economic and political discussion board platform. User profiles serve as the identity foundation for community members, enabling personalization, privacy control, and social interaction. The profile system must balance transparency (to build trust in discussions) with privacy (to protect users discussing sensitive political and economic topics).

This document specifies all aspects of user profiles including profile structure, customization options, notification preferences, privacy controls, activity history, and user blocking mechanisms. These features enable users to tailor their discussion board experience while maintaining control over their personal information and interaction preferences.

**Document Completion Note:**

This document provides comprehensive requirements for user profile management and personalization features in the economic and political discussion board platform. Backend developers have complete information about profile structure, customization options, notification preferences, privacy controls, activity tracking, blocking mechanisms, and security settings. All requirements are specified using natural language and EARS format where applicable, focusing on business rules and user needs rather than technical implementation details.

The implementation of these features will enable users to customize their discussion board experience, maintain privacy, control notifications, and manage their online presence effectively while participating in economic and political discussions.
