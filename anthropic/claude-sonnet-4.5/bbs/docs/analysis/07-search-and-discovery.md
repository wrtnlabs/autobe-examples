# Search and Discovery Requirements

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the search and discovery requirements for the economic and political discussion board platform. Search and discovery capabilities are critical for user engagement, allowing users to find relevant discussions efficiently, discover new topics of interest, and navigate the growing repository of economic and political discourse.

### 1.2 Business Context

In a discussion board focused on economic and political topics, users need powerful search capabilities to find specific discussions, track evolving debates, and discover content aligned with their interests. The search and discovery system serves multiple purposes:

- **Information Retrieval**: Users can find specific discussions, arguments, or data points quickly
- **Content Exploration**: Discovery features help users explore topics beyond their immediate search intent
- **Engagement Driver**: Trending and recommended content keeps users engaged with active discussions
- **Quality Surfacing**: Ranking algorithms surface high-quality, relevant discussions
- **Community Growth**: Effective discovery helps users find their niche within economics or politics

### 1.3 Scope

This document covers all search and discovery mechanisms including full-text search, filtering, trending topics, recommendations, category browsing, and tag-based discovery. Performance requirements and business rules governing search behavior are also specified.

For authentication and permissions affecting search visibility, refer to the [User Roles and Authentication Document](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md). For discussion structure and content organization, see the [Discussion Management Document](./03-discussion-management.md).
