# Voting and Engagement System Requirements

## Introduction and Overview

### Purpose
This document specifies the voting and engagement system for the economic and political discussion board platform. The voting system serves as the primary mechanism for community-driven content curation, allowing users to collectively surface high-quality contributions while discouraging low-quality or inappropriate content.

### Business Context
In economic and political discussions, the quality of discourse directly impacts platform value and user retention. A robust voting system enables the community to self-regulate content quality, reward thoughtful contributions, and create a meritocratic environment where the best ideas rise to prominence. This reduces the moderation burden while encouraging users to contribute meaningfully.

### Value Proposition
The voting and engagement features provide:
- **Community-Driven Quality Control**: Users collectively determine what content deserves visibility
- **Contributor Recognition**: Authors receive feedback and reputation based on contribution quality
- **Content Discovery**: High-quality discussions surface automatically without manual curation
- **User Motivation**: Reputation and engagement feedback encourage continued participation
- **Efficient Moderation**: Obviously poor content is naturally suppressed through community voting

### Scope
This document covers:
- Upvote and downvote mechanics
- Vote counting, display, and impact on content ranking
- Favorite and bookmark functionality
- User reputation system based on received votes
- Engagement notifications
- Anti-gaming measures to prevent vote manipulation

## Voting System Fundamentals

### Core Voting Mechanics

#### Vote Types
The platform supports two vote types:

1. **Upvote**: Indicates the content is valuable, well-reasoned, contributes to discussion, or demonstrates quality
2. **Downvote**: Indicates the content is low-quality, off-topic, misleading, or does not contribute constructively

#### Votable Content
Users can vote on:
- **Discussion Topics**: Original posts that start new discussions
- **Replies**: Comments and responses within discussion threads

#### Vote Display
Each piece of content displays:
- **Net Vote Score**: Total upvotes minus total downvotes (e.g., "+15", "-3", "0")
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear upvote and downvote buttons with state indication (voted/not voted)
- **User's Vote State**: Visual confirmation showing which direction (if any) the current user voted

### Vote Counting and Calculation

#### Basic Calculation
- Each upvote contributes +1 to the content's score
- Each downvote contributes -1 to the content's score
- Net score = (Total Upvotes) - (Total Downvotes)

#### Vote Persistence
- Votes are permanently recorded and associated with the voting user
- Vote totals update in real-time as users vote
- Historical vote data is maintained for reputation calculation and analytics

#### Vote Visibility
- **Net Score**: Always visible to all users (guests and members)
- **Individual Vote Breakdown**: May show "X upvotes, Y downvotes" to provide transparency
- **Vote Privacy**: Individual user votes are private; other users cannot see who voted which way

---

## Content Ranking and Visibility

### Primary Sorting Methods

#### Hot Ranking (Default View)
Content is ranked by a "hotness" score that considers:
- **Vote Score**: Higher net votes increase hotness
- **Recent Activity**: Recent replies and votes boost hotness
- **Time Decay**: Older content gradually loses hotness regardless of votes
- **Velocity**: Rapid vote accumulation increases hotness more than slow accumulation

**Purpose**: Surfaces currently active, high-quality discussions

#### Top Ranking
Content is sorted purely by net vote score (highest to lowest):
- Only vote total matters
- No time decay applied
- Shows all-time best content

**Purpose**: Identifies the highest-quality contributions regardless of age

#### New Ranking
Content is sorted by creation time (newest first):
- Vote scores do not affect position
- Purely chronological ordering

**Purpose**: Allows users to see the latest discussions and catch new content early

#### Controversial Ranking
Content with high engagement but divisive voting patterns:
- High total vote count (upvotes + downvotes)
- Near-equal upvotes and downvotes
- Indicates content generating strong debate

**Purpose**: Surfaces polarizing discussions that generate significant debate

### Ranking Algorithm Details

#### Hot Score Calculation Concept
While the exact algorithm is at developer discretion, the business requirement is:

**WHEN calculating hot score, THE system SHALL consider:**
- Net vote score (upvotes - downvotes)
- Time since content creation (older content decays)
- Time since last activity (recent activity boosts score)
- Vote velocity (rapid voting increases score)

**THE hot score SHALL decay over time** so that even highly-voted content eventually falls off the "hot" list

**THE hot score SHALL prioritize recent activity** to keep the "hot" feed dynamic

#### Ranking Update Frequency
- Rankings recalculate automatically as votes are cast
- Users see updated rankings when they refresh the page
- Hot rankings refresh periodically (e.g., every few minutes) to reflect decay

### Impact on User Experience

#### Default View
- When users browse a category or the main feed, content is sorted by "hot" by default
- This ensures active, quality discussions appear prominently
- Users can manually switch sorting to "new", "top", or "controversial"

#### Search Result Ranking
- Search results may use vote scores as a relevance signal
- Higher-voted content appears higher in search results when relevance is similar

---

## Favorite and Bookmark System

### Favoriting Discussions

#### Favorite Functionality
Users can "favorite" or "bookmark" discussion topics to save them for later reference:
- **Favorite Button**: Each discussion has a favorite/bookmark button
- **Personal Collection**: Favorited discussions appear in the user's personal favorites list
- **Quick Access**: Users can view all their favorited discussions from their profile

#### Favorite Management
- Members can add discussions to favorites with a single click
- Members can remove discussions from favorites at any time
- Favorites are private; other users cannot see what someone has favorited
- No limit on the number of discussions a user can favorite

### Favorites List Organization

#### Viewing Favorites
- Users access their favorites from their profile page
- Favorites display in a list with the same information as regular discussion lists
- Favorites can be sorted by date added, discussion title, or recent activity

#### Favorite Notifications (Optional Enhancement)
- Users may optionally receive notifications when favorited discussions receive new replies
- Notification preferences for favorites are configurable in user settings

### Use Cases for Favorites
- **Research and Reference**: Save important discussions on economic policies or political events for future reference
- **Follow-up**: Bookmark discussions to return and read later when time permits
- **Personal Interest**: Collect discussions on favorite topics or by preferred contributors

## User Reputation System

### Reputation Concept

#### Purpose of Reputation
User reputation is a numerical score representing the overall quality of a user's contributions as judged by the community. High reputation indicates a user consistently provides valuable insights and participates constructively.

#### Reputation Calculation
Reputation is calculated based on votes received on content the user has authored:
- **Upvote on User's Topic**: +5 reputation points
- **Downvote on User's Topic**: -2 reputation points
- **Upvote on User's Reply**: +2 reputation points
- **Downvote on User's Reply**: -1 reputation point

**Rationale**: Topics require more effort and risk than replies, so they earn/lose more reputation per vote.

#### Starting Reputation
- New users begin with 0 reputation
- Reputation can be positive or negative
- Negative reputation does not prevent participation but may affect trust signals

### Reputation Display

#### Public Visibility
- User reputation is displayed on their profile
- Reputation appears next to the user's name when they post content
- High reputation users may receive visual badges or indicators (e.g., "Trusted Contributor" for 1000+ reputation)

#### Reputation Tiers
The platform may define reputation tiers for recognition:
- **0-99**: New Contributor
- **100-499**: Active Member
- **500-999**: Valued Contributor
- **1000-4999**: Trusted Contributor
- **5000+**: Expert Contributor

**Note**: Tier names and thresholds can be adjusted based on community activity levels

### Reputation Impact

#### Trust Signals
- Higher reputation users may be perceived as more trustworthy by the community
- Reputation serves as social proof of contribution quality

#### Privilege Unlocking (Future Enhancement)
While not implemented in the initial version, reputation could unlock privileges such as:
- Ability to vote on moderation decisions
- Access to specialized discussion areas
- Reduced rate limiting for trusted users

#### No Direct Voting Power
- Reputation does NOT give users extra voting power
- Every user's vote counts equally regardless of reputation
- Reputation is a recognition metric, not a power metric

### Reputation Updates

#### Real-Time Calculation
- WHEN a user's content receives an upvote, THE system SHALL immediately add the corresponding reputation points to the user's total
- WHEN a user's content receives a downvote, THE system SHALL immediately subtract the corresponding reputation points
- WHEN a vote is changed or removed, THE system SHALL adjust reputation accordingly

#### Reputation History
- Users can view their reputation history showing gains and losses over time
- Reputation changes are tied to specific content votes for transparency

---

## Engagement Notifications

### Notification Triggers

#### Vote Milestone Notifications
Content authors receive notifications when their content reaches vote milestones:
- First upvote on new content
- Reaching +10, +25, +50, +100, +500 net votes
- Reaching controversial status (high engagement, divided votes)

#### Favorite Notifications
- WHEN another user favorites a discussion the current user created, THE system MAY notify the author (configurable)

#### Reputation Milestone Notifications
Users receive notifications when they reach reputation tiers:
- 100, 500, 1000, 5000 reputation points
- Recognition of contribution quality

### Notification Delivery

#### In-App Notifications
- Engagement notifications appear in the user's notification center
- Notifications include vote counts, reputation changes, and links to content

#### Email Notifications
- Users can configure email notifications for vote milestones
- Email preferences are managed in user settings
- See [Notification System Requirements](./08-notification-system.md) for detailed notification delivery specifications

### Notification Content

#### Vote Notification Format
Example: "Your discussion 'Economic Impact of Trade Policies' has reached +25 votes!"

#### Reputation Notification Format
Example: "Congratulations! You've reached 500 reputation points and earned the 'Valued Contributor' badge."

## Anti-Gaming and Fraud Prevention

### Vote Manipulation Prevention

#### Self-Voting Restriction
- THE system SHALL prevent users from voting on their own content
- THE system SHALL display clear messaging when users attempt to self-vote
- Vote buttons on user's own content SHALL be disabled

#### Vote Change Limitations
- Members CAN change their vote on content (upvote to downvote or vice versa)
- Members CAN remove their vote entirely
- THE system SHALL count only one vote per user per piece of content at any time

#### Multiple Account Prevention
While detecting multiple accounts is technically complex, the system includes basic safeguards:
- Registration requires email verification
- Rate limiting prevents rapid-fire voting from single IP addresses
- Suspicious voting patterns (e.g., multiple accounts always voting on the same user's content) may trigger manual review

### Rate Limiting for Votes

#### Voting Rate Limits
- THE system SHALL limit users to a maximum of 100 votes per hour to prevent automated voting
- WHEN a user exceeds the vote rate limit, THE system SHALL display an error message and temporarily disable voting
- Vote rate limits reset after 1 hour
- Rate limits apply to total votes (upvotes + downvotes combined)

#### Purpose of Rate Limiting
- Prevents automated bot voting
- Reduces the impact of vote brigading
- Encourages thoughtful voting rather than reflexive clicking

### Suspicious Pattern Detection

#### Voting Pattern Monitoring
The system monitors for suspicious patterns such as:
- **Coordinated Voting**: Multiple accounts voting identically on the same set of content in a short time
- **Vote Rings**: Groups of users always upvoting each other's content
- **Serial Downvoting**: Users consistently downvoting all content from a specific user

#### Automated Responses
- WHEN suspicious voting patterns are detected, THE system MAY temporarily suspend voting privileges for involved accounts
- THE system SHALL flag suspicious activity for moderator review
- Moderators can investigate and take action (warnings, vote reversal, account suspension)

### Vote Reversal

#### When Votes Are Reversed
- IF vote manipulation is confirmed by moderators or automated systems, THEN THE system SHALL reverse fraudulent votes
- THE system SHALL recalculate content scores and user reputation after vote reversal
- THE system SHALL notify affected users of vote reversal actions

#### Legitimate Vote Protection
- Legitimate votes are never reversed without clear evidence of fraud
- Users can appeal vote reversals through the standard appeal process
- See [Moderation System Requirements](./05-moderation-system.md) for appeal procedures

## Business Rules and Constraints

### Vote Change Policies

#### Unlimited Vote Changes
- Users can change or remove their votes at any time
- No time limit on vote changes
- Vote changes immediately affect content scores and author reputation

#### Vote History Preservation
- All vote changes are logged for audit purposes
- Historical vote data enables fraud detection
- Individual vote history is not publicly visible

### Time-Based Restrictions

#### No Voting on Archived Content
- IF a discussion is archived (e.g., older than 6 months with no recent activity), THEN THE system MAY disable voting on that content
- Archived content retains its vote score but cannot receive new votes
- Archive threshold is configurable

**Rationale**: Prevents old content from being manipulated long after active discussion has ended.

#### Edit Impact on Votes
- WHEN content is edited, existing votes remain unchanged
- Users are not required to re-vote after content is edited
- If content is substantially changed, users may independently choose to change their vote

### Content Deletion and Votes

#### Deleted Content Vote Handling
- WHEN content is deleted by the author or moderators, votes on that content are hidden from public display
- Votes remain recorded in the database for potential restoration
- IF content is restored, vote scores reappear

#### Reputation Impact of Deleted Content
- WHEN content with votes is deleted, the author's reputation adjusts to remove those votes
- IF content is restored, reputation is recalculated to include the votes again

### Edge Cases and Special Conditions

#### Simultaneous Voting
- IF two users vote on the same content at nearly the same time, THE system SHALL process both votes correctly without data loss
- Database transactions ensure vote count accuracy

#### Vote Button Spam
- Rapidly clicking vote buttons does not create multiple votes
- THE system SHALL debounce vote button clicks to prevent accidental double-voting
- Only one vote action is processed per user per content at a time

#### Negative Net Scores
- Content can have negative net vote scores (more downvotes than upvotes)
- There is no lower limit on how negative a score can go
- Negative scores affect ranking (content with very negative scores ranks lowest)

---

## User Experience Requirements

### Response Time Expectations

**THE system SHALL display clear error messages when voting actions fail:**
- Rate limit exceeded
- Attempting to vote on own content
- Network or server errors

### Error Handling from User Perspective

#### Vote Action Failures

**WHEN a vote action fails due to network error, THE system SHALL:**
- Revert any optimistic UI updates
- Display a user-friendly error message: "Unable to process vote. Please try again."
- Allow the user to retry the action

**WHEN a user attempts a restricted action (self-voting, voting while suspended), THE system SHALL:**
- Display a clear, specific error message explaining why the action is not allowed
- Provide guidance on what the user can do instead (e.g., "You cannot vote on your own content")

#### Favorite Action Failures

**WHEN favoriting or unfavoriting fails, THE system SHALL:**
- Display an error message: "Unable to update favorites. Please try again."
- Revert the UI to the previous state
- Allow the user to retry

### Accessibility Considerations
