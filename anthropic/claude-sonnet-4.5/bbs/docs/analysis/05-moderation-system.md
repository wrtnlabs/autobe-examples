# Moderation System Requirements

## Overview

### Purpose of Moderation System
The moderation system serves as the critical infrastructure for maintaining civil, respectful, and productive discourse on economic and political topics. Given the sensitive and often contentious nature of political and economic discussions, the moderation system must balance free expression with community safety, ensure transparent processes, and provide fair recourse for users who believe they have been treated unfairly.

### Moderation Philosophy
The platform adopts a graduated enforcement approach that prioritizes education and rehabilitation over punitive measures. The moderation system assumes good faith from users while providing robust tools to address bad actors. Moderators act as facilitators of healthy discourse rather than censors, intervening only when content violates clearly defined community guidelines.

### Key Principles
- **Transparency**: Users understand why actions were taken and have visibility into the moderation process
- **Consistency**: Similar violations receive similar treatment across all users and moderators
- **Fairness**: Users have opportunities to appeal decisions and present their perspective
- **Accountability**: All moderation actions are logged and can be reviewed for quality and fairness
- **Timeliness**: Reports are addressed promptly to maintain community trust and safety

## Content Reporting System

### Report Submission

**WHEN a member views content (topic or reply), THE system SHALL display a "Report" action that opens the reporting interface.**

**WHEN a guest views content, THE system SHALL NOT display reporting functionality.**

**WHEN a user submits a content report, THE system SHALL require the user to select a violation category from the predefined list.**

**WHEN a user submits a content report, THE system SHALL allow the user to provide optional additional context (up to 500 characters) explaining the violation.**

**WHEN a user submits a valid content report, THE system SHALL create the report record within 2 seconds and display confirmation to the user.**

**WHEN a user attempts to report the same content item multiple times, THE system SHALL prevent duplicate reports and inform the user that they have already reported this content.**

### Report Categories

The system supports the following violation categories:

| Category | Description | Severity Level |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Personal Attack | Direct insults, name-calling, or harassment targeting specific users | High |
| Hate Speech | Content promoting hatred or violence against groups based on identity | Critical |
| Misinformation | Deliberate spread of false information presented as fact | Medium |
| Spam | Repetitive, off-topic, or commercial content not related to discussion | Low |
| Offensive Language | Profanity, vulgar language, or inappropriate expressions | Medium |
| Off-Topic | Content unrelated to economics, politics, or the discussion subject | Low |
| Threats | Explicit or implicit threats of harm or violence | Critical |
| Doxxing | Sharing private personal information without consent | Critical |
| Trolling | Intentionally disruptive or provocative content meant to derail discussion | Medium |
| Other | Violations not covered by other categories (requires explanation) | Variable |

**THE system SHALL present these violation categories in the order listed above when users submit reports.**

**WHEN a user selects "Other" as the violation category, THE system SHALL require the user to provide explanatory text (minimum 20 characters).**

### Report Queue Management

**WHEN a new report is submitted, THE system SHALL add it to the moderation queue with "Pending" status.**

**THE system SHALL assign a unique report ID to each submitted report.**

**THE system SHALL record the following information for each report:**
- Report ID
- Reported content ID and type (topic or reply)
- Reporting user ID
- Violation category
- Optional user explanation
- Report submission timestamp
- Current status (Pending, Under Review, Resolved, Dismissed)
- Assigned moderator ID (if assigned)
- Resolution timestamp (when resolved)
- Moderator decision and notes

**WHEN multiple users report the same content, THE system SHALL create separate report records but flag the content as having multiple reports.**

**THE system SHALL prioritize reports in the moderation queue based on:**
1. Critical severity violations (Hate Speech, Threats, Doxxing) - Highest priority
2. High severity violations (Personal Attack) - High priority
3. Number of reports on the same content (3+ reports elevates priority)
4. Medium severity violations - Normal priority
5. Low severity violations - Lower priority
6. Time in queue (older reports gradually increase in priority)

## Moderation Queue and Workflow

### Queue Access and Organization

**WHEN a moderator accesses the moderation queue, THE system SHALL display all pending and under-review reports visible to that moderator.**

**WHEN an administrator accesses the moderation queue, THE system SHALL display all reports across all moderators.**

### Report Assignment

**WHEN a moderator views an unassigned report in the queue, THE system SHALL provide an "Assign to Me" action.**

**WHEN a moderator selects "Assign to Me" on an unassigned report, THE system SHALL assign the report to that moderator and change status to "Under Review".**

**WHEN a report is assigned to a moderator, THE system SHALL prevent other moderators from claiming that same report.**

**WHEN an administrator views any report, THE system SHALL allow reassignment to any moderator regardless of current assignment.**

**IF a report remains in "Under Review" status for more than 24 hours, THEN THE system SHALL flag the report as "Delayed" and notify administrators.**

## Success Criteria and Metrics

### Moderation Effectiveness Metrics

**THE system SHALL track the following key performance indicators:**

- **Report Response Time**: Average time from report submission to moderator action
  - Target: 80% of reports resolved within target time for severity level
  
- **Appeal Reversal Rate**: Percentage of appeals that result in decision reversal or modification
  - Target: <15% reversal rate (indicates consistent, accurate initial moderation)
  
- **User Satisfaction**: Percentage of users who acknowledge moderation was fair (optional survey)
  - Target: >70% satisfaction among users who interacted with moderation
  
- **Repeat Violation Rate**: Percentage of warned users who commit subsequent violations
  - Target: <30% repeat violation rate (indicates effective education)
  
- **Moderator Consistency**: Standard deviation of decisions across moderators for similar violations
  - Target: Low variance indicating consistent application of guidelines

### Community Health Indicators

**THE system SHALL monitor community health metrics influenced by moderation:**

- **Report Volume Trend**: Increasing or decreasing reports over time
  - Healthy: Decreasing reports indicates improving community behavior
  
- **Civil Discourse Score**: Ratio of constructive discussions to moderated violations
  - Target: >95% of content requires no moderation
  
- **User Retention**: Percentage of active users who remain engaged after moderation interaction
  - Target: >80% of warned users continue participating productively

### Transparency and Trust Metrics

**THE system SHALL measure transparency through:**

- **Appeal Utilization Rate**: Percentage of moderation actions that result in appeals
  - Healthy range: 5-15% (too low suggests users don't trust appeals, too high suggests poor initial moderation)
- **Moderator Visibility**: User awareness of moderation guidelines and processes
  - Target: >80% of surveyed users understand basic moderation policies
