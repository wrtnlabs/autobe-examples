# Discussion Board Documentation - Table of Contents

## Introduction

This documentation suite provides comprehensive business requirements for developing an economic and political discussion board platform. The documentation is organized into 11 interconnected documents that cover business strategy, functional requirements, user experience, and system constraints.

**Target Audience**: This documentation is written primarily for backend developers who will implement the discussion board system. Business stakeholders and project managers will also find the strategic and functional requirements valuable for understanding the platform's scope and objectives.

**Documentation Philosophy**: These documents focus on **business requirements only**. All technical implementation decisions—including architecture, API design, database schemas, technology stack, and deployment strategies—are at the discretion of the development team.

## Project Context
