Critical interactions include:
- Viewing a discussion topic and its replies
- Submitting an upvote or downvote
- Marking a notification as read
- Loading the user's profile page
- Accessing the discussion board homepage

#### Standard User Operations (Should Feel Fast)
WHEN a user performs a standard operation, THE system SHALL respond within 2 seconds.

Standard operations include:
- Creating a new discussion topic
- Posting a reply to an existing discussion
- Searching for discussions with basic filters
- Loading category pages with discussion lists
- Editing an existing post or comment
- Viewing user profiles of other members

#### Complex Operations (Should Complete Quickly)
WHEN a user performs a complex operation, THE system SHALL respond within 5 seconds.

Complex operations include:

- Loading long discussions with 100+ replies
- Generating user activity history reports
- Processing content reports for moderators
- Exporting user data upon request

#### Timeout and Feedback Requirements
WHEN any operation exceeds 3 seconds, THE system SHALL display a loading indicator to inform the user that processing is in progress.

WHEN an operation exceeds the maximum allowed time, THE system SHALL display a timeout error message with clear guidance on how to proceed.

### Page Load Performance

#### Initial Page Load
WHEN a user first accesses the discussion board, THE system SHALL display meaningful content within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections.

WHEN a user accesses the platform on a mobile device, THE system SHALL optimize content delivery for mobile networks and display usable content within 3 seconds.

#### Subsequent Navigation
WHEN a user navigates between pages after the initial load, THE system SHALL display new content within 1 second.

THE system SHALL cache frequently accessed data to minimize repeated server requests and improve navigation speed.

### Search Performance

#### Basic Search
WHEN a user performs a basic text search across discussions, THE system SHALL return results within 2 seconds.

#### Filtered Search
WHEN a user applies filters (category, date range, vote count) to search results, THE system SHALL update results within 1 second.

#### Large Result Sets
WHEN search results exceed 100 items, THE system SHALL paginate results and load each page within 2 seconds.

THE system SHALL display the total count of search results instantly, even before all results are fully processed.

### Concurrent User Handling

#### Normal Load Conditions
THE system SHALL support at least 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

WHEN concurrent users are below normal capacity, THE system SHALL maintain all response time requirements specified above.

#### Peak Load Conditions
THE system SHALL support peak loads of up to 5,000 concurrent users during high-traffic events (political debates, economic announcements).

WHEN the system approaches capacity limits, THE system SHALL prioritize critical read operations (viewing content) over write operations (posting new content).

#### Traffic Spike Protection
WHEN traffic suddenly spikes beyond normal capacity, THE system SHALL implement graceful degradation rather than complete service failure.

IF the system must reduce functionality during extreme load, THEN THE system SHALL maintain read-only access to discussions while temporarily limiting new post creation.

#### Password Security Standards
THE system SHALL enforce strong password requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters in length
- Must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
- Cannot be a commonly used password (e.g., "Password123!")
- Cannot match the user's email address or username

WHEN a user creates or changes a password, THE system SHALL validate against these requirements and provide clear feedback on any violations.

THE system SHALL store all passwords using industry-standard cryptographic hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, or equivalent) with appropriate salt values.

THE system SHALL NEVER store passwords in plain text or reversible encryption formats.

#### Authentication Attempt Protection
WHEN a user fails to log in correctly, THE system SHALL record the failed attempt.

WHEN a user fails 5 consecutive login attempts from the same account within 15 minutes, THE system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes.

WHEN an account is locked due to failed login attempts, THE system SHALL notify the account owner via email with instructions for account recovery.

THE system SHALL implement CAPTCHA or similar challenge-response mechanisms after 3 failed login attempts to prevent automated brute-force attacks.

#### Session Security
THE system SHALL use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management with the following requirements:
- Access tokens expire after 30 minutes of issuance
- Refresh tokens expire after 7 days of issuance
- Tokens must include user ID, role, and permissions in the payload

THE system SHALL implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the execution of unauthorized scripts.

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention
THE system SHALL implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations (creating, editing, deleting content).

WHEN a user submits a form or API request that modifies data, THE system SHALL validate the CSRF token before processing the request.

#### Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection
WHEN a user or IP address exceeds allowed request rates, THE system SHALL temporarily block further requests and return HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.

Rate limits include:
- Authentication attempts: 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes per account
- API requests: 100 requests per minute per user
- Content creation: 10 new topics per hour, 50 replies per hour per user
- Search requests: 30 searches per minute per user

THE system SHALL implement IP-based rate limiting to prevent distributed attacks.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization
THE system SHALL validate all user input against expected formats, lengths, and types before processing.
