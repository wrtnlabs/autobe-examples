# Discussion Management

## Introduction

This document defines the complete business requirements for discussion management functionality in the economic and political discussion board platform. Discussion management represents the core value proposition of the platform, enabling users to create topics, engage in threaded conversations, and discover relevant content on economic and political subjects.

The discussion management system must facilitate organized, searchable, and engaging conversations while maintaining clear categorization for economic and political topics. All requirements focus on business logic and user interactions, with technical implementation decisions left to the development team.

## Discussion Topic Creation

### Topic Creation Overview

Members can create new discussion topics to initiate conversations on economic and political subjects. Topic creation requires authentication and follows specific business rules to ensure quality content and proper organization.

### Topic Creation Requirements

**TR-001: Member Topic Creation**
WHEN a member wants to start a new discussion, THE system SHALL provide a topic creation interface where the member can enter title, content, category, and tags.

**TR-002: Topic Title Requirements**
THE topic title SHALL be between 10 and 200 characters in length. THE system SHALL display a character counter and validation feedback in real-time as the user types.

**TR-005: Optional Tag Assignment**
WHEN creating a topic, THE member MAY assign up to 5 tags to help with topic discovery and organization. Tags help users find related discussions more easily.

**TR-006: Topic Creation Validation**
WHEN a member submits a new topic, THE system SHALL validate all required fields (title, content, category) before accepting the submission. IF validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL display specific error messages indicating which fields need correction.

**TR-007: Successful Topic Creation**
WHEN all validation passes, THE system SHALL create the new topic, assign it a unique identifier, record the creation timestamp, set the author as the creator, set the initial status as "active", and redirect the member to view the newly created topic.

**TR-008: Topic Creation Confirmation**
WHEN a topic is successfully created, THE system SHALL display a confirmation message and notify the user that their topic is now live and visible to other members.

**TR-009: Draft Saving**
WHILE a member is composing a topic, THE system SHALL automatically save draft content every 60 seconds to prevent data loss. Drafts are stored temporarily and associated with the user's session.

**TR-010: Guest Restriction**
WHEN a guest attempts to create a topic, THE system SHALL deny access and display a message prompting the guest to register or log in to participate in discussions.

### Topic Creation User Workflow

1. Member navigates to "Create New Topic" option
2. System displays topic creation form with fields for title, content, category selection, and optional tags
3. Member enters topic title (10-200 characters)
4. Member writes topic content (50-50,000 characters)
5. Member selects one primary category (required)
6. Member optionally adds up to 5 tags
7. System validates input in real-time and displays character counts
8. System auto-saves draft every 60 seconds
9. Member submits the topic
10. System performs final validation
11. If validation passes, system creates topic and redirects to topic view
12. If validation fails, system displays specific error messages
13. Member corrects errors and resubmits

### Category System Overview

The platform organizes discussions into predefined categories specifically designed for economic and political discourse. Categories provide the primary organizational structure for content discovery.

### Category Requirements

**CAT-001: Primary Categories**
THE system SHALL support the following primary categories:
- Economics - General economic theory, policy, and analysis
- Politics - Political systems, governance, and policy
- Current Events - Recent economic and political developments
- Fiscal Policy - Government spending, taxation, and budgets

- Trade and Commerce - International trade, tariffs, and commercial policy
- Labor and Employment - Workforce issues, unions, and employment policy
- Regulation and Markets - Market regulation, antitrust, and oversight
- Social Policy - Healthcare, education, welfare, and social programs

**CAT-002: Category Selection Display**
WHEN a member creates a topic, THE system SHALL display all available categories in an easy-to-scan format with category names and brief descriptions to help the member select the most appropriate category.

**CAT-005: Category Topic Count**
WHEN displaying category lists, THE system SHALL show the number of active topics in each category to help users identify active discussion areas.

### Tag System Requirements

**TAG-001: Tag Purpose**
Tags provide additional categorization and discovery mechanisms beyond primary categories. Tags are user-generated and help connect related discussions across different primary categories.

**TAG-002: Tag Creation**
WHEN a member creates or edits a topic, THE member MAY create new tags or select from existing tags. Tag creation is open to all members to encourage organic topic organization.

**TAG-003: Tag Format**
Tags SHALL be single words or short phrases between 2 and 30 characters in length, containing only letters, numbers, hyphens, and spaces. THE system SHALL automatically convert tags to lowercase for consistency.

**TAG-004: Tag Limit Per Topic**
THE system SHALL allow members to assign up to 5 tags per topic. This limit prevents tag spam while allowing sufficient topic description.
