  /**
   * Create temporary guest session for browsing public discussions.
   *
   * Creates a new guest session account for unauthenticated visitors to the
   * discussion board platform. This endpoint enables temporary,
   * non-authenticated access for browsing public discussions, topics, and
   * content without requiring full registration. Guest accounts are tracked for
   * analytics purposes, conversion metrics, and potential newsletter signups.
   *
   * Guest sessions are created with a unique session_id that identifies the
   * visitor throughout their browsing experience. The system records optional
   * metadata including email address (if guest subscribes to newsletter), IP
   * address for security and geographic tracking, and user agent information
   * for device type identification and compatibility analysis.
   *
   * Upon successful guest account creation, the system issues temporary JWT
   * tokens (access token and refresh token) that enable tracked browsing
   * sessions. The access token expires after 30 minutes and can be refreshed
   * using the refresh token, which expires after 7 days. These tokens allow the
   * platform to track guest engagement metrics including page views, visit
   * duration, and content interests for conversion funnel analysis.
   *
   * Guest accounts are distinguished from full member accounts by their
   * read-only privileges. Guests can view public discussions, browse
   * categories, search content, and view user profiles, but cannot create
   * topics, post replies, vote on content, or access member-only features. This
   * limited access model encourages registration while providing value through
   * content discovery.
   *
   * The guest registration process supports the platform's growth strategy by
   * enabling frictionless initial access while collecting data for conversion
   * optimization. Guest email addresses can be used for targeted registration
   * reminders and newsletter campaigns to convert visitors into active
   * members.

  /**
   * Refresh expired access token for guest browsing session.
   *
   * Refreshes the JWT access token for guest users using a valid refresh token.
   * This endpoint enables guests to maintain continuous browsing sessions
   * without re-creating their guest account when the access token expires after
   * 30 minutes.
   *
   * When a guest's access token expires, the client automatically sends the
   * refresh token to this endpoint to obtain a new access token without
   * disrupting the browsing experience. The system validates the refresh
   * token's signature, expiration status, and revocation status before issuing
   * new credentials.
   *
   * The refresh token validation process checks that the token has not expired
   * (7-day lifetime), has not been revoked through session termination, and
   * corresponds to an active guest session record in the database. If
   * validation succeeds, the system generates a fresh access token with updated
   * expiration timestamp while maintaining the same guest session identity and
   * metadata.
   *
   * This refresh mechanism is critical for guest user experience, allowing
   * extended browsing sessions for content exploration, research, and
   * evaluation before committing to full registration. Guests can explore
   * multiple discussion topics, search content, and navigate categories across
   * multiple hours or days without authentication interruption.
   *
   * The system may optionally implement refresh token rotation, where each
   * refresh request generates both a new access token and a new refresh token,
   * invalidating the old refresh token for enhanced security. This prevents
   * refresh token reuse attacks while maintaining session continuity for
   * legitimate guest users.
   *
   * If the refresh token is invalid, expired, or revoked, the system returns an
   * authentication error, prompting the guest to create a new guest session or
   * register for a full member account to continue accessing the platform.
