   * Register a new administrator account with platform control privileges.
   *
   * Creates a new administrator account with full platform control and
   * administrative privileges. This operation is the entry point for onboarding
   * new administrative staff who will manage the discussion board platform.
   *
   * The registration process collects essential administrator credentials
   * including username (3-30 characters, alphanumeric with hyphens and
   * underscores), email address (must be unique and verifiable), and password
   * meeting security requirements (minimum 8 characters with uppercase,
   * lowercase, number, and special character). The username and email fields
   * reference the discussion_board_administrators table schema which defines
   * these as unique fields requiring verification.
   *
   * Upon successful registration, the system creates a new administrator record
   * in the discussion_board_administrators table with account_status set to
   * 'pending_verification' initially, and email_verified set to false. A
   * verification email is sent to the provided email address containing a
   * time-limited verification token. The administrator must verify their email
   * before gaining full access to administrative functions.
   *
   * Security considerations for administrator registration include enhanced
   * password requirements, potential IP whitelisting for administrator
   * registration endpoints, and audit logging of all administrator account
   * creation events in the discussion_board_audit_logs and
   * discussion_board_security_logs tables. Administrator registration is a
   * high-sensitivity operation that should be restricted or require approval
   * from existing super administrators in production environments.
   *
   * The response includes JWT tokens (access token and refresh token) following
   * the authentication token structure defined in the discussion_board_sessions
   * and discussion_board_refresh_tokens tables. The access token expires after
   * 30 minutes and the refresh token expires after 7-30 days depending on
   * 'Remember Me' preferences. These tokens enable the newly registered
   * administrator to authenticate for subsequent administrative operations once
   * email verification is complete.

  /**
   * Authenticate administrator and issue access tokens.
   *
   * Authenticates an existing administrator account by validating credentials
   * and issuing JWT access and refresh tokens for administrative session
   * management.
   *
   * The login process accepts either the administrator's unique email address
   * or username along with their password. The system retrieves the
   * administrator record from the discussion_board_administrators table,
   * verifies the account exists and has account_status set to 'active', checks
   * that email_verified is true, and validates the submitted password against
   * the stored password_hash using bcrypt comparison with minimum cost factor
   * 12.
   *
   * Security measures include comprehensive logging of all login attempts in
   * the discussion_board_login_history table with fields capturing
   * email_attempted, is_successful status, failure_reason for failed attempts,
   * ip_address, device_type, browser_info, and location for security analysis.
   * The system implements account lockout protection: after 5 consecutive
   * failed login attempts within 15 minutes, the account is temporarily locked
   * for 30 minutes and the administrator receives an email notification about
   * the lockout event.
   *
   * Upon successful authentication, the system generates a new session record
   * in the discussion_board_sessions table with
   * discussion_board_administrator_id referencing the authenticated
   * administrator, access_token_hash containing the hashed JWT access token,
   * device_type, browser_info, ip_address, and location extracted from the
   * request context. The session expires_at timestamp is set to 30 minutes from
   * issuance for the access token. Simultaneously, a refresh token record is
   * created in discussion_board_refresh_tokens with the session reference,
   * refresh_token_hash, and expires_at set to 7-30 days based on Remember Me
   * preference.
   *
   * The response contains the JWT tokens following the
   * IDiscussionBoardAdministrator.IAuthorized format, enabling the
   * administrator to access protected administrative endpoints including user
   * management, moderator appointment via the discussion_board_moderators
   * table, category management in discussion_board_categories, system
   * configuration, moderation oversight through
   * discussion_board_moderation_actions, and comprehensive audit log access

  /**
   * Refresh administrator access token using valid refresh token.
   *
   * Renews the administrator's access token using a valid refresh token,
   * extending the authenticated session without requiring credential re-entry.
   *
   * The token refresh process accepts the current refresh token (typically
   * stored in httpOnly cookie or secure storage) and validates it against the
   * discussion_board_refresh_tokens table. The system verifies the
   * refresh_token_hash matches an existing record, checks that is_revoked is
   * false, confirms the expires_at timestamp has not passed (standard
   * expiration is 7-30 days based on Remember Me preference), and validates the
   * associated session in discussion_board_sessions is still active with
   * is_active set to true.
   *
   * The system retrieves the administrator account via the session's
   * discussion_board_administrator_id foreign key, verifies the account_status
   * is 'active' in the discussion_board_administrators table, and confirms the
   * account has not been suspended or banned. Any account status changes
   * (suspension, ban, role revocation) invalidate all existing tokens and
   * prevent refresh token usage.
   *
   * Upon successful validation, the system generates a new JWT access token
   * with expires_at set to 30 minutes from issuance, updates the session's
   * last_activity_at timestamp in discussion_board_sessions to reflect ongoing
   * administrator activity, and optionally implements refresh token rotation by
   * generating a new refresh token and marking the old one as is_revoked true
   * for enhanced security.
   *
   * The response returns fresh JWT tokens in the
   * IDiscussionBoardAdministrator.IAuthorized format containing the new access
   * token and optionally a new refresh token if rotation is enabled. This
   * mechanism enables administrators to maintain long-running authenticated
   * sessions for administrative tasks without security degradation, while the
   * relatively short access token lifetime (30 minutes) limits the window of
   * vulnerability if a token is compromised.
   *
   * Security considerations include comprehensive logging of token refresh
   * events in discussion_board_security_logs with event_type 'token_refresh',
   * tracking ip_address and user_agent for anomaly detection, and implementing
   * refresh token rotation policies that invalidate old refresh tokens after
   * successful refresh operations to prevent token replay attacks.
