   * Register new member account and issue initial JWT tokens.
   *
   * Creates a new member account for the discussion board platform, allowing
   * users to participate in economic and political discussions. This operation
   * implements the registration workflow defined in the User Roles and
   * Authentication requirements.
   *
   * The registration process validates all input fields against business rules:
   * username must be 3-30 characters (alphanumeric with hyphens and
   * underscores), email must be unique and valid format, and password must meet
   * security requirements (minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase,
   * number, and special character). The system checks username and email
   * uniqueness across the discussion_board_members table to prevent duplicate
   * accounts.
   *
   * Upon successful validation, the system creates a new member record with
   * account_status set to 'pending_verification' and email_verified set to
   * false. The password is hashed using bcrypt with cost factor 12 before
   * storage in the password_hash field. The system generates a unique
   * verification token and sends it to the provided email address, allowing the
   * user to complete email verification within 24 hours.
   *
   * Immediately after account creation, the system generates JWT access and
   * refresh tokens for the new member. The access token expires in 30 minutes
   * and includes claims for userId, username, email, role (member), and
   * permissions. The refresh token expires in 7 days (or 30 days if Remember Me
   * is selected) and enables token renewal without re-authentication. These
   * tokens are returned in the response, allowing the user to immediately
   * access member features.
   *
   * The operation sets initial default values for the member account:
   * profile_visibility to 'public', activity_visibility to 'public',
   * account_status to 'pending_verification', and is_active to true. Timestamps
   * created_at and updated_at are set to the current time.
   *
   * This endpoint is public (authorizationRole is null) as it must be
   * accessible to unauthenticated users creating new accounts. After
   * registration, users should verify their email to unlock full posting
   * privileges, though basic browsing is available immediately with the issued
   * tokens.

  /**
   * Authenticate member and issue JWT access and refresh tokens.
   *
   * Authenticates a registered member and creates a new authenticated session
   * with JWT tokens. This operation implements the login workflow defined in
   * the User Roles and Authentication requirements, providing secure access to
   * the discussion board platform.
   *
   * The authentication process validates the provided credentials (email or
   * username and password) against the discussion_board_members table. The
   * system retrieves the member record by email or username, then uses bcrypt
   * to compare the submitted password with the stored password_hash. This
   * cryptographic comparison ensures passwords are never transmitted or stored
   * in plain text.
   *
   * Before granting access, the system verifies multiple account eligibility
   * criteria. First, it checks that the account exists and the password
   * matches. Second, it verifies the email_verified field is true, as
   * unverified accounts cannot log in per security requirements. Third, it
   * checks the account_status field is 'active' (not 'suspended', 'banned', or
   * 'deactivated'). If any validation fails, the system returns an error
   * without revealing which specific check failed, preventing account
   * enumeration attacks.
   *
   * The system implements brute-force protection by tracking failed login
   * attempts. After 5 consecutive failures within 15 minutes for the same
   * account, the system temporarily locks the account for 30 minutes and sends
   * a security notification email to the account owner. This is tracked through
   * the discussion_board_login_history table with is_successful=false entries.
   * During lockout, all login attempts are rejected with a message indicating
   * the temporary restriction and remaining time.
   *
   * Upon successful authentication, the system creates a new session record in
   * the discussion_board_sessions table with access_token_hash (hashed JWT
   * access token), device_type and browser_info extracted from the user agent,
   * ip_address and approximate location for security monitoring, and is_active
   * set to true. The access token expires in 30 minutes (expires_at timestamp),
   * while the refresh token in the related discussion_board_refresh_tokens
   * table expires in 7 days (or 30 days if Remember Me is selected).
   *
   * The system also records a successful login entry in
   * discussion_board_login_history with is_successful=true, device information,
   * IP address, and timestamp. This login history is displayed to users in
   * their account security settings and used for detecting suspicious login
   * patterns. The last_login_at and last_activity_at timestamps on the member
   * record are updated to the current time.
   *
   * The response returns both access and refresh tokens along with member
   * account information including id, username, email, display_name, role
   * ('member'), permissions array, reputation score from
   * discussion_board_user_reputation table, and account metadata. The client
   * stores the access token for API requests and the refresh token for
   * obtaining new access tokens when the current one expires.
   *
   * This endpoint is public (authorizationRole is null) as it must be
   * accessible to unauthenticated users attempting to log in. After successful
   * authentication, users can access all member features as defined in the
   * permission matrix.

  /**
   * Refresh expired access tokens using valid refresh token.
   *
   * Renews JWT access tokens for members without requiring password
   * re-authentication. This operation implements the token refresh workflow
   * defined in the User Roles and Authentication requirements, enabling
   * seamless session continuation when access tokens expire.
   *
   * The refresh process validates the submitted refresh token against records
   * in the discussion_board_refresh_tokens table. The system first validates
   * the token signature and structure, then hashes the token and searches for a
   * matching refresh_token_hash in the database. For valid tokens, it checks
   * the expires_at timestamp to ensure the token has not expired (standard
   * 7-day expiration, or 30 days for Remember Me sessions), verifies the
   * is_revoked flag is false, and confirms the associated session in
   * discussion_board_sessions is still active (is_active=true).
   *
   * The system then performs additional account validation by retrieving the
   * member record through the session relationship. It verifies the
   * account_status is 'active' (not suspended or banned), checks the deleted_at
   * field is null (account not deleted), and confirms email_verified is true.
   * If the account has been compromised or restricted since the refresh token
   * was issued, the token refresh is denied and all tokens for that account may
   * be revoked.
   *
   * Upon successful validation, the system generates a new access token with
   * fresh 30-minute expiration, including updated claims for userId, username,
   * email, role, and current permissions from the member record. The new access
   * token reflects any role changes or permission updates that may have
   * occurred since the original token was issued. The system optionally
   * implements refresh token rotation by generating a new refresh token,
   * marking the old refresh token as used (is_revoked=true with revoked_at
   * timestamp), and creating a new refresh token record with fresh expiration.
   *
   * The system updates the session's last_activity_at timestamp in the
   * discussion_board_sessions table to track active session usage. This helps
   * identify and clean up inactive sessions during session management. The
   * member's last_activity_at timestamp is also updated to reflect continued
   * platform engagement.
   *
   * If the refresh token is invalid, expired, or revoked, the system returns an
   * error requiring full re-authentication. This occurs when tokens expire
   * naturally, when users log out (tokens added to revocation list), when
   * passwords are changed (all tokens revoked), or when administrators
   * terminate sessions for security reasons. The client must redirect to the
   * login endpoint to obtain new tokens.
   *
   * The response returns the new access token and optionally a new refresh
   * token (if rotation is implemented), along with token expiration information
   * and updated member session data. This allows clients to seamlessly continue
   * authenticated API requests without user interruption.
   *
   * This endpoint is public (authorizationRole is null) as it uses the refresh
   * token itself as authentication. However, it requires a valid, non-expired,
   * non-revoked refresh token to succeed. The endpoint is critical for
   * maintaining continuous user sessions across the 30-minute access token
   * lifecycle.
