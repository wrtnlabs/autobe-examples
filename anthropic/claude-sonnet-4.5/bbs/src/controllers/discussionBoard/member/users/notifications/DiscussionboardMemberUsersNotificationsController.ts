   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of user notifications.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of notifications for
   * a specific user from the discussion board notification system. This
   * operation provides advanced search and filtering capabilities for users to
   * manage their notification history, find specific types of notifications,
   * and review activity alerts across the platform.
   *
   * The operation supports filtering by notification type (reply_to_topic,
   * reply_to_comment, mention, vote_milestone, moderation_action,
   * system_announcement, watched_topic_update, welcome), read status (read,
   * unread, all), delivery channel (in-app, email), and date ranges. Users can
   * search for notifications related to specific topics, replies, or triggering
   * users, enabling efficient notification management and historical review.
   *
   * This endpoint integrates with the discussion_board_notifications table as
   * defined in the Prisma schema, accessing all notification fields including
   * triggering users (members, moderators, administrators), related content
   * (topics, replies, moderation actions), delivery status, and read tracking.
   * The operation respects user privacy by only returning notifications that
   * belong to the authenticated user identified by the userId path parameter.
   *
   * Security considerations include verifying that the authenticated user
   * matches the userId path parameter to prevent unauthorized access to other
   * users' notifications. The operation enforces ownership validation ensuring
   * users can only access their own notification data. Rate limiting may be
   * applied to prevent excessive notification queries, though typical user
   * notification browsing patterns should fall well within acceptable limits.
   *
   * The response includes paginated notification summaries optimized for
   * notification center display, including notification type indicators,
   * triggering user information, content previews, timestamps, read status, and
   * deep links to related content. The operation supports sorting by creation
   * date (newest first by default), notification type, or read status to help
   * users organize their notification feed according to their preferences.
   *
   * This operation is essential for the notification management user
   * experience, allowing users to review their notification history, identify
   * unread notifications, filter by activity type, and efficiently navigate to
   * content that requires their attention. It complements the real-time
   * notification delivery system by providing historical access and advanced
   * management capabilities beyond the basic notification center view.

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific user notification by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve comprehensive details for a single notification record identified
   * by notificationId belonging to the user identified by userId. This
   * operation provides complete notification information including notification
   * type, triggering event details, related content references, delivery
   * channel status, and read tracking metadata.
   *
   * The operation accesses the discussion_board_notifications table as defined
   * in the Prisma schema, returning full notification data including all
   * foreign key references to triggering users (members, moderators,
   * administrators), related discussion content (topics, replies), associated
   * moderation actions, and complete delivery status tracking for both in-app
   * and email channels.
   *
   * When a notification is retrieved, the system returns detailed information
   * about what triggered the notification, who performed the triggering action,
   * what content is involved, and the notification's current state
   * (read/unread, seen/unseen, delivery status). This enables rich notification
   * display in user interfaces showing full context and allowing users to
   * understand exactly what activity occurred and navigate directly to relevant
   * content.
   *
   * Security validation ensures that the authenticated user matches the userId
   * path parameter and that the requested notification actually belongs to that
   * user. The operation prevents users from accessing notifications belonging
   * to other users by validating the notification's user_id field against the
   * authenticated user's identity before returning data. If the notification
   * does not belong to the authenticated user or does not exist, appropriate
   * error responses are returned.
   *
   * This operation is typically used when a user clicks on a notification in
   * their notification center to view full details, or when the system needs to
   * mark a notification as read after user interaction. It may automatically
   * update the is_read and read_at fields when accessed, depending on business
   * logic implementation, though this read-tracking behavior is handled by
   * backend application logic rather than specified in the API operation
   * itself.
   *
   * The detailed notification information enables the user interface to display
   * rich notification cards showing the triggering user's profile information,
   * preview of related content, action timestamps, and contextual navigation
   * options. For moderation action notifications, this includes the full
   * moderation reason and appeal process information. For reply notifications,
   * this includes the reply preview and direct link to the conversation
   * thread.

  /**
   * Update notification read status for a specific user notification.
   *
   * Updates the read status of a specific notification in the user's
   * notification center. This operation allows users to mark individual
   * notifications as read, which updates both the is_read boolean flag and sets
   * the read_at timestamp in the discussion_board_notifications table.
   *
   * The operation validates that the notification belongs to the specified user
   * before processing the update. This ensures users can only modify their own
   * notifications and cannot manipulate other users' notification states. The
   * system checks that the userId parameter matches the user_id field in the
   * notification record.
   *
   * When a notification is marked as read, the is_read field is set to true and
   * the read_at timestamp is set to the current time. This data is used
   * throughout the platform to display unread notification counts in the
   * notification center badge, filter notifications by read/unread status, and
   * track user engagement with notifications.
   *
   * The operation supports updating other notification properties beyond read
   * status, such as is_seen (whether user viewed the notification in the list
   * without clicking), allowing flexible notification state management. This
   * enables the platform to distinguish between notifications that were merely
   * displayed versus those the user actively engaged with.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the notification system defined in the

  /**

   * discussion_board_notifications table, implementing a soft deletion pattern
   * that preserves notification data for audit purposes while hiding it from
   * the user's view.
   *
   * The operation first validates that the notification belongs to the
   * specified user by checking that the userId parameter matches the user_id
   * field in the notification record. This security check ensures users can
   * only delete their own notifications and cannot manipulate other users'
   * notification histories.
   *
   * According to the Prisma schema, the discussion_board_notifications table
   * includes a deleted_at field, indicating this operation performs soft
   * deletion rather than permanent removal. The soft-deleted notification is
   * immediately hidden from the user's notification center and no longer
   * appears in their notification list or contributes to the unread
   * notification count badge. However, the record is retained in the database
   * for the 90-day retention period specified in the notification system
   * requirements.
   *
   * This deletion capability supports the notification management features
   * outlined in the requirements, which specify that users should be able to
   * delete individual notifications and perform bulk deletion of read
   * notifications. The operation provides users with control over their
   * notification history, allowing them to maintain a clean, relevant
   * notification center by removing outdated or unnecessary alerts.
   *
   * After successful deletion, the notification is immediately removed from all
   * user-facing interfaces including the notification center dropdown,
   * notification history page, and unread count calculations. The system
   * recalculates the notification badge count to reflect the removal.
