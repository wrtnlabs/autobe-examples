  /**
   * Create a new blocking relationship to block another user from interacting
   * with the authenticated member.
   *
   * Create a new user blocking relationship where the authenticated member
   * blocks another member to prevent unwanted interactions and filter their
   * content from the blocker's view. This operation implements the asymmetric
   * blocking mechanism that is central to user privacy and control on the
   * discussion board platform.
   *
   * Blocking is a critical user empowerment feature that allows members to
   * curate their discussion board experience by removing disruptive, offensive,
   * or simply unwanted interactions from specific users. When a member blocks
   * another user, the blocker will no longer see the blocked user's discussion
   * topics, replies, or receive any notifications from them. The blocking
   * relationship is asymmetric, meaning that blocking user B does not prevent B
   * from seeing A's contentâ€”only A's view is filtered.
   *
   * The operation validates several critical business rules before creating the
   * block. First, it verifies that the authenticated user matches the userId
   * parameter to prevent unauthorized blocking on behalf of other users.
   * Second, it checks that the user is not attempting to block themselves,
   * which would be illogical and is explicitly prevented. Third, it validates
   * that the target user exists and is a valid member account (not deleted or
   * banned). Fourth, it enforces the platform's business rule limiting each
   * member to a maximum of 100 blocked users to prevent abuse and maintain
   * system performance. Finally, it checks that a blocking relationship does
   * not already exist between these two users to prevent duplicate blocks.
   *
   * The request body includes the target user's identifier (the user to be
   * blocked) and an optional reason for the block. The reason field is optional
   * but encouraged, as it helps the blocker remember why they blocked someone
   * when reviewing their blocked users list later. It also provides context to
   * support teams if a blocking relationship is reported as retaliatory or
   * abusive, though blocks themselves are generally unrestricted user
   * preferences.
   *
   * Upon successful block creation, the operation records the blocking
   * relationship in the discussion_board_blocked_users table with the blocker's
   * ID, blocked user's ID, optional reason, and current timestamp. The response
   * returns the created block relationship including the blocked user's basic
   * profile information (username, display name) to confirm which user was
   * blocked. The blocked user does not receive any notification that they have
   * been blocked, maintaining privacy for the blocker.
   *
   * If a user previously blocked and then unblocked another user (creating a
   * soft-deleted block record with deleted_at set), creating a new block
   * establishes a fresh blocking relationship with a new record and timestamp.
   * The system does not reuse soft-deleted block records.
   *
   * This operation is essential for user safety and experience, particularly on
   * a platform focused on potentially contentious political and economic
   * discussions. It empowers users to create their own boundaries and filter
   * out interactions that detract from their platform experience, reducing the
   * need for moderator intervention in interpersonal conflicts. The blocking
   * system is detailed in the User Profiles and Preferences requirements
   * document under the blocked users management section.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Unique identifier of the user who is creating the block (the
   *   blocker)
   * @param body Information about the user to block including their identifier
   *   and optional reason for blocking

  /**
   * Retrieve paginated list of blocked users for a specific member with

   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered list of users that a specific member has
   * blocked on the discussion board platform. This operation provides members
   * with visibility into their blocked user list, allowing them to review who
   * they have blocked, when the blocks were created, and why users were blocked
   * if reasons were provided.
   *
   * The blocking system is a core privacy and user experience feature that
   * allows members to control their interactions on the platform. When a user
   * blocks another user, they no longer see that user's topics, replies, or
   * receive notifications from them. This operation enables users to manage
   * their block list by reviewing all current blocks with filtering, sorting,
   * and search capabilities.
   *
   * Security considerations ensure that users can only access their own blocked
   * user list unless they have moderator or administrator privileges. The
   * operation validates that the requesting user matches the userId parameter
   * or has elevated permissions. This prevents unauthorized access to other
   * users' blocking relationships, which are considered private user
   * preferences.
   *
   * The response includes essential information about each blocked user
   * including their username, display name, when they were blocked, and any
   * reason provided during blocking. This helps users remember why they blocked
   * specific individuals and make informed decisions about maintaining or
   * removing blocks. The blocked user's basic profile information is included
   * to provide context without requiring additional API calls.
   *
   * Filtering options support searching by username, filtering by date range
   * (when blocks were created), and sorting by various criteria. Pagination
   * ensures efficient handling of large block lists, with the standard 20 items
   * per page. The operation respects the business rule maximum of 100 blocked
   * users per account, so result sets will never exceed this limit.
   *
   * The operation automatically filters out soft-deleted blocking relationships
   * (where deleted_at is not null) to return only currently active blocks. This
   * ensures users see only their current blocking relationships, not historical
   * blocks that have been removed.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the user profile and preferences system
   * documented in the User Profiles and Preferences requirements, specifically
   * the blocked users management functionality. It supports the privacy and
   * user control principles central to the platform's design philosophy for
   * managing interactions on sensitive political and economic discussions.

   * @param connection

   * Remove a user blocking relationship to unblock a previously blocked user.
   *
   * Removes an existing user blocking relationship, allowing the authenticated
   * user to once again see content from and receive notifications from the
   * previously blocked user. This operation performs a hard delete on the
   * discussion_board_blocked_users table, permanently removing the block record
   * from the database.
   *
   * When a user unblocks another user, the system immediately restores
   * visibility of the unblocked user's topics, replies, and other content
   * throughout the platform. The user who performed the unblock will also
   * resume receiving notifications from the previously blocked user according
   * to their notification preference settings.
   *
   * The operation validates that the authenticated user is the blocker (user_id
   * matches blocker_id in the block record) to prevent users from removing
   * other users' blocks. It also confirms that an active blocking relationship
   * exists between the specified users before attempting deletion. If no block
   * relationship exists, the operation returns an error indicating the block
   * was not found.
   *
   * This operation is part of the user privacy and interaction control features
   * defined in the User Profiles and Preferences requirements. Users can manage
   * their blocked users list through their profile settings, with a maximum of
   * 100 blocked users per account. The business rules enforce a limit of 3
   * block/unblock cycles per user pair per day to prevent abuse of the blocking
   * system.
   *
   * Security considerations include verifying the authenticated user's identity
   * through JWT token validation and ensuring users cannot manipulate other
   * users' blocking relationships. The operation enforces role-based access
   * control where only the blocker themselves can remove their own blocks.
   *
   * After successful unblock, users may immediately see the previously blocked
   * user's content in discussion threads and search results. The change takes
   * effect instantly without requiring page refresh for real-time interfaces,
