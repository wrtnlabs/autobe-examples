   * Create a new discussion topic in the economic and political discussion
   * board platform. This operation enables authenticated members to initiate
   * conversations on economic and political subjects by providing a title,
   * detailed body content, category assignment, and optional tags.
   *
   * The operation validates all input according to comprehensive business rules
   * defined in the platform requirements. The topic title must be between 10
   * and 200 characters and cannot consist entirely of uppercase letters or
   * contain only special characters. The topic body must contain between 20 and
   * 50,000 characters of meaningful content and supports Markdown formatting
   * for rich text presentation. The system rejects topics with excessive URLs
   * (more than 10) or content that consists of more than 80% URLs or special
   * characters.
   *
   * Category assignment is mandatory - each topic must be assigned to exactly
   * one predefined category from the available options including Economics,
   * Politics, Current Events, Policy Analysis, Economic Theory, Political
   * Theory, International Relations, or Domestic Policy. This categorization
   * enables efficient content organization and discovery. Tags are optional but
   * limited to a maximum of 5 per topic, with each tag between 2-30 characters
   * in length containing only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and spaces.
   *
   * The operation enforces strict rate limiting to prevent spam and abuse.
   * Members can create a maximum of 5 topics per hour and 20 topics per day.
   * New accounts less than 24 hours old are restricted to 3 topics per day. The
   * system also implements duplicate content detection, rejecting topics
   * identical to content the user posted within the last 24 hours.
   *
   * Security considerations include authentication verification through JWT
   * tokens, permission validation ensuring the user has member role, and
   * automated spam detection that flags or rejects content matching known spam
   * patterns. Upon successful creation, the topic is assigned a unique UUID
   * identifier, the author is recorded, creation and update timestamps are set,
   * the status is set to 'active', and initial counters for view_count and
   * reply_count are set to 0. The topic becomes immediately visible in the
   * discussion board and searchable by other users.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the notification system to send welcome
   * notifications for first-time topic creators and may trigger notifications
   * to users following the selected tags. The newly created topic appears in
   * category browsing, search results, and recent activity feeds according to
   * the platform's content discovery algorithms.

  /**
   * Update an existing discussion topic's content, category, or tags.
   *
   * Update an existing discussion topic in the economic and political
   * discussion board platform. This operation allows topic authors, moderators,
   * and administrators to modify topic content including title, body, category
   * assignment, and tags according to role-based permissions and time-based
   * restrictions.
   *
   * Permission validation ensures that only authorized users can edit topics.
   * Regular members can only edit their own topics, while moderators and
   * administrators can edit any topic on the platform. The system enforces
   * strict time-based editing windows to maintain discussion integrity: members
   * have 24 hours from topic creation to make edits, with an extended 7-day
   * window for members with 100+ reputation points. Moderators and
   * administrators are exempt from time restrictions and can edit topics at any
   * time.
   *
   * When a topic has received more than 10 replies, the system implements a
   * title lock to prevent confusion in ongoing discussions. The title cannot be
   * changed after this threshold to maintain context for participants, but the
   * topic body, category, and tags remain editable within the allowed time
   * window. This business rule ensures that active discussions maintain
   * consistent identity while still allowing content refinement.
   *
   * All edit operations undergo the same comprehensive validation as topic
   * creation. The title must remain between 10-200 characters, cannot be all
   * uppercase, and must contain at least 3 alphabetic characters. The body
   * content must be between 20-50,000 characters and cannot exceed URL limits
   * (maximum 10 URLs, less than 80% URL content). Category assignment must
   * reference a valid, active category from the predefined list. Tags are
   * validated for proper format (2-30 characters, alphanumeric with hyphens and
   * spaces) and count (maximum 5 tags per topic).
   *
   * The system automatically records all edits in the
   * discussion_board_edit_history table for transparency and accountability.
   * Each edit creates an immutable audit record containing snapshots of content
   * before and after modification, the editor's identity, timestamp, and
   * optional edit reason. When content has been edited more than 3 times, the
   * system displays an 'edited' indicator to inform readers that the content
   * has undergone multiple revisions.
   *
   * Locked topics (status='locked') prevent all editing except by
   * administrators, maintaining discussion preservation for archived or
   * finalized conversations. Deleted topics (soft deleted with deleted_at
   * timestamp) cannot be edited and must be restored first. The operation
   * updates the topic's updated_at timestamp to reflect the modification time,
   * which affects the topic's position in 'recently active' and 'recently
   * updated' sorting views.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the notification system to alert users
   * watching the topic that content has been modified. It also respects user
   * blocking relationships, ensuring that edits to topics by blocked users
   * remain invisible to users who have blocked the author.

  /**
   * Permanently delete a discussion topic from the system.
   *
   * This operation permanently removes a discussion topic from the platform by
   * performing a soft deletion that sets the deleted_at timestamp on the
   * discussion_board_topics record. The deletion behavior varies based on the
   * user's role and the topic's state.
   *
   * For regular members (discussion_board_members), the ability to delete their
   * own topics is restricted by business rules: they can only delete topics
   * they authored within 1 hour of creation and only if the topic has received
   * zero replies. This time-based restriction maintains discussion thread
   * integrity and prevents authors from removing topics after community
   * engagement has begun. When a member attempts to delete a topic outside
   * these constraints, the system denies the request and explains the
   * restriction.
   *
   * For moderators (discussion_board_moderators) and administrators
   * (discussion_board_administrators), topic deletion is permitted at any time
   * regardless of the topic's age or reply count. This administrative
   * capability supports content moderation, guideline enforcement, and platform
   * management. Moderators typically delete topics that violate community
   * guidelines, contain prohibited content, or represent spam.
   *
   * The deletion process sets the deleted_at timestamp in the
   * discussion_board_topics table rather than physically removing the record.
   * This soft deletion approach preserves content for audit purposes, supports
   * moderation review, and maintains database referential integrity. The Prisma
   * schema shows that deleted topics remain in the database but are filtered
   * from normal user queries. According to the data retention policies,
   * soft-deleted content is retained for 30 days to support recovery in case of
   * accidental deletion or successful moderation appeals.
   *
   * When a topic is deleted, the system handles associated data appropriately.
   * All replies to the topic (discussion_board_replies records) are also hidden
   * from public view through cascading soft deletion or visibility rules. Votes
   * (discussion_board_votes), favorites (discussion_board_favorites), and
   * watched topic subscriptions (discussion_board_watched_topics) on the
   * deleted topic are preserved in the database but become inaccessible to
   * regular users. The system creates an audit trail entry recording who
   * deleted the topic, when it was deleted, and the reason (if provided by a
   * moderator).
   *
   * Security considerations include validating that the requesting user has
   * appropriate permissions based on their role and the topic ownership. The
   * system must verify the user's authentication token, check role-based
   * permissions from the permission matrix, validate topic ownership for member
   * deletions, and enforce the time-based deletion window for members. Rate
   * limiting does not typically apply to deletion operations since they cannot
   * be spammed effectively.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the moderation system when moderators or
   * administrators perform deletions. The deletion may be associated with a
   * moderation_action record that documents the violation and rationale. Users
   * affected by moderator deletions receive notifications explaining the action
   * and any appeals process available.
