  /**
   * Create a new reply to a discussion topic or nested reply within the topic.
   *
   * Create a new reply to an existing discussion topic, enabling members to
   * participate in threaded conversations on economic and political subjects.
   * This operation supports both top-level replies directly to the main topic
   * and nested replies responding to other members' comments, maintaining the
   * conversation hierarchy that facilitates organized, contextual discussions.
   *
   * The operation creates records in the discussion_board_replies table as
   * defined in the Prisma schema, which supports threaded conversations up to
   * 10 levels deep through parent-child relationships. Reply content must be
   * between 1 and 10,000 characters in length with Markdown formatting support
   * for rich text expression. The system automatically calculates the
   * depth_level based on the parent reply's depth to enforce the 10-level
   * threading constraint defined in the discussion management requirements.
   *
   * Security and authorization considerations require that only authenticated
   * members (not guests) can post replies, and the user's account must be in
   * good standing (not suspended or banned). The operation validates that the
   * target topic exists, belongs to the specified topicId parameter, and is in
   * an active state that permits new replies. Locked topics prevent new replies
   * except from administrators, and archived topics are read-only. The system
   * enforces rate limiting rules of maximum 30 replies per hour and 200 replies
   * per day per user to prevent spam, with additional cooldown periods if users
   * post more than 3 replies to the same topic within 5 minutes.
   *
   * The request body includes the reply content, optional parent_reply_id for
   * nested replies, and any formatting preferences. When a reply is
   * successfully created, the system increments the parent topic's reply_count,
   * updates the topic's last_activity timestamp, and triggers notifications to
   * relevant users (topic author for top-level replies, parent reply author for
   * nested replies, or users mentioned with @username syntax). The response
   * returns the complete newly created reply object including its assigned
   * unique identifier, depth level, creation timestamp, and author
   * information.
   *
   * This operation integrates closely with the notification system documented
   * in the notification requirements, triggering reply_to_topic or
   * reply_to_comment notifications based on whether the reply is top-level or
   * nested. It also respects user blocking relationships, preventing blocked
   * users from seeing each other's replies in the thread display. Validation
   * rules from the business rules document ensure content quality, prevent
   * duplicate submissions, and maintain civil discourse standards for economic
   * and political discussions.
   *
   * Related operations that users typically combine with reply creation include
   * viewing the parent topic to understand discussion context (GET
   * /topics/{topicId}), retrieving the full reply thread for reference (GET
   * /topics/{topicId}/replies), and editing the newly created reply within the
   * allowed time window if corrections are needed (PUT
   * /topics/{topicId}/replies/{replyId}). The threading structure enables
   * complex multi-party discussions while maintaining clear conversation flow
   * and context.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param topicId Unique identifier of the discussion topic to which the reply
   *   is being posted
   * @param body Reply content and threading information for creating a new
   *   discussion reply

  /**
   * Update a reply's content within allowed edit time window.
   *
   * Updates the content of an existing reply to a discussion topic, subject to
   * time-based editing restrictions and permission validation. This operation
   * allows members to modify their own reply content within specific time
   * constraints that vary based on user reputation: standard members can edit
   * replies within 1 hour of posting, while members with 100+ reputation points
   * have a 24-hour edit window. Moderators and administrators can edit any
   * reply at any time without time restrictions.
   *
   * The operation validates multiple business rules before allowing the update:
   * it verifies the reply exists and belongs to the specified topic, confirms
   * the requesting user is either the original author or has
   * moderator/administrator privileges, checks that the edit is within the
   * allowed time window based on the user's reputation score and role, and
   * ensures the topic is not locked (which would prevent all editing except by
   * administrators). Content validation applies the same rules as reply
   * creation, including length constraints (1-10,000 characters), URL limits
   * (maximum 5 URLs, flagged for review if exceeded), duplicate detection
   * (rejecting identical content to previous replies by same user in same
   * topic), and content quality checks (profanity filtering, spam pattern
   * detection, prohibited content screening).
   *
   * When a reply is successfully updated, the system records the edit in the
   * discussion_board_edit_history table, capturing the previous content, new
   * content, optional edit reason, editor identity, and modification timestamp.
   * This creates a comprehensive audit trail for transparency in discussions.
   * The reply's updated_at timestamp is refreshed, and an 'Edited' indicator is
   * displayed next to the reply showing when it was last modified. The parent
   * topic's updated_at timestamp is also refreshed to reflect recent activity.
   *
   * Security and authorization considerations include validating the JWT token
   * to confirm user identity, enforcing role-based permissions (members can
   * only edit their own replies unless they have moderator/administrator
   * roles), checking that the user account is not suspended or banned
   * (suspended users cannot edit content), and respecting topic lock status
   * (locked topics prevent editing except by administrators). The operation
   * returns appropriate error responses for various failure scenarios: 404 if
   * the topic or reply doesn't exist, 403 if the user lacks permission to edit
   * the reply, 400 if the edit window has expired or content validation fails,
   * and 423 if the topic is locked and user is not an administrator.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the reputation system to determine edit
   * window duration, the moderation system to respect content locks and user
   * suspensions, the validation system to enforce content quality rules, and
   * the edit history system to maintain transparency and auditability of
   * content modifications.

  /**
   * Mark a reply as deleted with soft delete to support recovery.
   *
   * Marks a reply as deleted by setting the deleted_at timestamp, supporting a
   * 30-day recovery window consistent with platform data retention policies.
   * This operation allows members to delete their own replies within 1 hour of
   * posting if the reply has no child replies, while moderators and
   * administrators can delete any reply at any time without time restrictions.
   * The operation uses soft delete to preserve data for potential recovery and
   * maintain audit trail integrity.
   *
   * The operation validates multiple conditions before allowing deletion: it
   * verifies the reply exists and belongs to the specified topic, confirms the
   * requesting user is either the original author within the deletion time
   * window or has moderator/administrator privileges, checks that the topic is
   * not locked (which would prevent deletion except by administrators), and
   * examines whether the reply has any child replies that depend on it for
   * thread structure.
   *
   * Deletion behavior uses soft delete in both scenarios by setting the
   * deleted_at field to the current timestamp. If the reply has NO child
   * replies, the system sets the deleted_at timestamp, decrements the parent
   * topic's reply_count, updates the topic's updated_at timestamp, creates an
   * audit log entry recording the deletion, and hides the reply from normal
   * user views while preserving it in the database. If the reply HAS child
   * replies, the system sets the deleted_at timestamp to mark deletion,
   * replaces the content field with '[deleted]' placeholder text to maintain
   * readability, maintains the reply's position in the thread hierarchy,
   * preserves all child replies in their original structure, and ensures
   * conversation flow remains understandable. After 30 days, permanently
   * deleted records may be purged from the database as part of data retention
   * policies.
   *
   * Time-based restrictions apply to member deletions: members can only delete
   * their own replies within 1 hour of posting, after which the deletion option
   * is removed to maintain discussion continuity and prevent retroactive
   * content removal that could confuse ongoing conversations. Members with 100+
   * reputation points do not receive an extended deletion window—the 1-hour
   * limit applies universally to all members regardless of reputation. However,
   * moderators and administrators can delete any reply at any time as part of
   * their content management responsibilities, and their deletions are logged
   * in the moderation audit trail.
   *
   * When a reply is successfully deleted, the system sets the deleted_at
   * timestamp, updates the parent topic's metadata to reflect the removed
   * content, triggers a notification to the reply author if deletion was
   * performed by a moderator (not for self-deletions), records the deletion in
   * the audit trail with actor identity and timestamp, and returns a success
   * confirmation. For moderator deletions, the action is logged in
   * discussion_board_moderation_actions table with deletion reason and content
   * snapshot.
   *
   * Security and authorization considerations include validating the JWT token
   * to confirm user identity, enforcing role-based permissions (members can
   * only delete their own replies within time window, moderators and
   * administrators can delete any reply), checking that the user account is not
   * suspended or banned, and respecting topic lock status (locked topics
   * prevent deletion except by administrators). The operation returns
   * appropriate error responses for various failure scenarios: 404 if the topic
   * or reply doesn't exist, 403 if the user lacks permission to delete the
   * reply, 400 if the deletion time window has expired for member
   * self-deletion, and 423 if the topic is locked and user is not an
   * administrator.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the discussion management system to maintain
   * reply counts and thread structure, the moderation system to log moderator
   * deletions and respect content locks, the audit system to record all
   * deletion events with actor and timestamp, and the notification system to
   * alert users when their content is removed by moderators.
