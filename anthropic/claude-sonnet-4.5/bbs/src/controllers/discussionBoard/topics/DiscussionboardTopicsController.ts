  /**
   * Retrieve filtered and paginated list of discussion topics with advanced
   * search capabilities.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of discussion topics
   * from the economic and political discussion board platform. This operation
   * provides the primary mechanism for content discovery, allowing users to
   * search, filter, sort, and browse discussions based on multiple criteria
   * including keywords, categories, tags, vote scores, date ranges, author, and
   * topic status.
   *
   * The operation implements complex search and filtering functionality that
   * goes beyond simple GET parameters, justifying the PATCH method for the
   * request body. Users can combine multiple filters simultaneously to find
   * highly specific discussions on economic and political topics. For example,
   * users might search for "inflation policy" within the Economics category,
   * tagged with "monetary-policy", created in the last 30 days, with at least
   * 10 votes, sorted by recent activity.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the discussion_board_topics table as defined
   * in the Prisma schema, accessing fields including title, body, status,
   * view_count, reply_count, is_pinned, created_at, and updated_at. It also
   * joins with discussion_board_categories for category filtering,
   * discussion_board_topic_tags and discussion_board_tags for tag-based
   * filtering, and discussion_board_members for author information.
   *
   * The search functionality implements full-text search across topic titles
   * and body content using PostgreSQL's trigram indexing capabilities (as
   * indicated by the gin_trgm_ops indexes in the schema). This enables
   * efficient fuzzy matching and relevance-based ranking of search results. The
   * operation enforces rate limiting of 30 searches per minute per user as
   * specified in the business rules to prevent system abuse.
   *
   * Security considerations include appropriate filtering based on topic status
   * and deleted_at timestamps. Deleted topics (deleted_at IS NOT NULL) are
   * excluded from results for regular users but may be visible to moderators
   * and administrators based on their roles. Topics with status 'active' are
   * shown normally, while 'locked' and 'archived' topics are included with
   * appropriate status indicators.
   *
   * The response includes paginated results with topic summary information
   * optimized for list displays. Each topic in the results includes essential
   * metadata: title, author username, category name, creation date, reply
   * count, view count, vote score, tags, and last activity timestamp. The
   * pagination structure follows the platform standard of 25 topics per page as
   * defined in the Discussion Management requirements.
   *
   * Related API operations that might be used together with this endpoint
   * include GET /discussionBoard/topics/{topicId} for viewing individual topic
   * details after discovering them through this search operation. Users
   * typically first execute this search/filter operation to get a list of
   * relevant topics, then navigate to specific topics for detailed reading.

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific discussion topic by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve complete detailed information for a specific discussion topic
   * identified by the topicId path parameter. This operation provides the full
   * topic view that users access when they click on a topic from search
   * results, category listings, or direct links. The operation returns
   * comprehensive topic data including the complete title and body content,
   * author details, category assignment, associated tags, engagement metrics
   * (votes, views, replies), and current topic status.
   *
   * This operation integrates directly with the discussion_board_topics table
   * from the Prisma schema, accessing all fields including id, title, body,
   * status, view_count, reply_count, is_pinned, created_at, updated_at, and
   * deleted_at. The operation joins with discussion_board_categories to
   * retrieve the full category information, discussion_board_members to get
   * author details, and discussion_board_topic_tags to fetch all associated
   * tags for the topic.
   *
   * Security and visibility considerations are critical for this operation. The
   * system validates that the requested topic exists and has not been
   * soft-deleted. Topics where deleted_at IS NOT NULL are excluded from regular
   * user access and return 404 Not Found, while moderators and administrators
   * can view deleted topics with appropriate indicators. Topics with status
   * 'locked' or 'archived' remain visible to all users but display status
   * badges and have restricted interaction capabilities.
   *
   * The operation implements view count tracking per the business requirements:
   * when any user views a topic, the system automatically increments the
   * view_count field in the discussion_board_topics table as a side effect of
   * this GET operation. The system counts only one view per user per 24-hour
   * period to prevent artificial inflation. This tracking is handled internally
   * by the backend service logic and does not require a separate API
   * operation.
   *
   * The detailed topic response includes author information from the
   * discussion_board_members table such as username, display_name, avatar_url,
   * and account_status. This allows users to see who created the topic and
   * access their profile for more context about the author's contribution
   * history and expertise.
   *
   * Category information is fully expanded in the response, including the
   * category name, slug, description, and parent category if applicable (for
   * hierarchical category structures like Economics > Macroeconomics). This
   * provides users with complete context about how the topic is organized
   * within the platform's taxonomy.
   *
   * All associated tags are retrieved through the discussion_board_topic_tags
   * junction table and included in the response. Tags help users understand the
   * topic's specific focus areas and enable tag-based discovery of related
   * discussions. The response includes tag names and may include tag
   * descriptions where available.
   *
   * Engagement metrics included in the response provide social proof and
   * indicate discussion activity levels: view_count shows how many users have
   * viewed the topic, reply_count indicates the level of discussion activity,
   * and vote scores (calculated from related voting data) show community
   * reception. The is_pinned field indicates whether moderators have featured
   * this topic as particularly important or high-quality.
   *
   * Temporal information helps users understand topic timeline: created_at
   * shows when the topic was first posted, updated_at reflects the last
   * modification (either topic edit or new reply), enabling sorting by recent
   * activity. If the topic has been edited, the response may include an edited
   * indicator based on data from the discussion_board_edit_history table.
   *
   * This operation must be executed before users can interact with a topic
   * through replies, votes, or other engagement mechanisms. It provides the
   * foundation for all topic-specific operations including operations for
   * posting replies, voting, and bookmarking the topic.

   * queries the discussion_board_edit_history table filtering for
   * entity_type='topic' and entity_id matching the specified topicId
   * parameter.
   *
   * The edit history serves multiple critical purposes in maintaining platform
   * integrity and user trust. For economic and political discussions where
   * accuracy and context matter significantly, users need visibility into how
   * discussion topics have evolved. Each edit record captures a snapshot of the
   * content before and after modification, the editor's identity, the
   * timestamp, and optionally the reason for the edit.
   *
   * This operation supports pagination and filtering capabilities through the
   * request body, allowing users to navigate through extensive edit histories
   * efficiently. Users can filter by date ranges to see recent modifications or
   * historical changes, sort by edit timestamp to understand content evolution
   * chronologically, and search within edit history to find specific
   * modifications.
   *
   * Security considerations include verifying that the topic exists and is
   * accessible to the requesting user based on their role and the topic's
   * visibility settings. While edit history is generally public for
   * transparency, deleted or hidden topics may have restricted edit history
   * access limited to moderators and administrators. The operation respects
   * content visibility rules defined in the discussion management system.
   *
   * The response includes comprehensive edit information: previous content
   * state, new content state, editor information (username and role), edit
   * timestamp, optional edit reason, and metadata about the edit context. This
   * level of detail enables users to understand exactly how and why content
   * changed, supporting informed discussion participation and content
   * verification.
