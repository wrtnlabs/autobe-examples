  /**
   * Retrieve privacy-filtered profile information for a specific discussion
   * board member.
   *
   * Retrieve comprehensive profile information for a single discussion board
   * member identified by their unique UUID. This operation accesses the
   * discussion_board_members table and returns privacy-controlled user profile
   * data including username, display name, bio, avatar URL, location, website,
   * account status, email verification status, profile and activity visibility
   * settings, and activity timestamps (last login, last activity). The response
   * also includes related reputation statistics and contribution counts when
   * available.
   *
   * **CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT**: The response DTO MUST explicitly exclude
   * the following sensitive fields from the discussion_board_members schema:
   * `email` (authentication credential and PII), `password_hash`
   * (authentication secret), and any other internal security fields. These
   * fields must NEVER be exposed through this public API endpoint regardless of
   * privacy settings.
   *
   * The member user system represents registered, authenticated participants
   * who form the core user base of the discussion board. Members can create
   * topics, post replies, vote on content, customize profiles, and manage
   * preferences. This endpoint provides the data necessary to display user
   * profile pages, show author information on discussion posts, and support
   * user discovery and networking features.
   *
   * Privacy considerations are critical for this operation. The
   * discussion_board_members table includes profile_visibility and
   * activity_visibility fields that control what information is exposed. The
   * operation applies the following privacy rules based on the Prisma schema:
   *
   * - If profile_visibility is 'public', all non-sensitive profile information is
   *   returned to any requester including unauthenticated guests
   * - If profile_visibility is 'members_only', profile information is returned
   *   only to authenticated members, moderators, and administrators
   * - If profile_visibility is 'private', only the profile owner (matching userId
   *   to authenticated user) can view full profile details; others see minimal
   *   public information (username and role badge only)
   * - Email addresses are NEVER returned in the response regardless of privacy
   *   settings, as they are sensitive authentication credentials
   * - Password hashes are NEVER returned under any circumstances
   * - Activity statistics respect the activity_visibility field independently
   *   from profile visibility
   *
   * The operation validates that the userId parameter is a valid UUID format
   * and that the member exists in the database. If the member is not found, has
   * been soft-deleted (deleted_at is not null), or the requesting user lacks
   * permission due to privacy settings, the API returns an appropriate error
   * response.
   *
   * This endpoint integrates with the authentication system to determine the
   * requesting user's role and identity for privacy enforcement.
   * Unauthenticated requests (guests) receive only publicly visible data.
   * Authenticated members see data according to privacy settings. Moderators
   * and administrators may have elevated visibility for moderation and user
   * management purposes, though email addresses and password hashes remain
   * strictly protected.
   *
   * The response includes account_status field from the schema which indicates
   * whether the account is active, pending_verification, suspended, banned, or
   * deactivated. This field helps explain why certain users may not be creating
   * new content. The email_verified boolean indicates whether the user has
   * completed email verification, which affects their posting privileges.
   *
   * Activity timestamps (last_login_at and last_activity_at) provide engagement
   * indicators. The created_at field shows account age, which is often
   * displayed as 'Member since [date]' on profile pages. These temporal fields
   * help users assess contributor credibility and activity levels.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Unique identifier of the target member user to retrieve

  /**
   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of discussion board members.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of discussion board members from the
   * system. This operation provides advanced search capabilities for finding
   * members based on multiple criteria including partial username matching,
   * display name searching, account status filtering, registration date ranges,
   * last activity timestamps, reputation score ranges, and email verification
   * status.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive pagination with configurable page
   * sizes and sorting options. Results can be sorted by registration date, last
   * login timestamp, last activity timestamp, username alphabetically,
   * reputation score, or other relevant member attributes in ascending or
   * descending order.
   *
   * Security considerations include appropriate filtering of sensitive member
   * information based on the requesting user's authorization level. While this
   * endpoint is public to support member discovery features, sensitive fields
   * are strictly excluded from response payloads for privacy protection.
   *
   * CRITICAL PRIVACY PROTECTION: Email addresses, while supported as search
   * filter criteria (email verification status filtering), are NEVER included
   * in the response payload under any circumstances. The ISummary response type
   * explicitly excludes the email field, password_hash, and all other private
   * information to comply with privacy requirements and data protection
   * regulations. Only public profile fields (username, display_name, bio,
   * avatar_url, location, website, account_status, email_verified boolean flag,
   * reputation score, registration date, last activity date) are included in
   * search results. Full member details including email addresses are only
   * accessible through authenticated single-member retrieval endpoints with
   * appropriate ownership or administrative authorization.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the discussion_board_members table as
   * defined in the Prisma schema, incorporating all available member fields and
   * relationships including reputation scores from the
   * discussion_board_user_reputation table and engagement statistics. The
   * response includes member summary information optimized for list displays
   * with essential fields for member identification and basic profile
   * information while strictly protecting private data.
   *
   * The search functionality supports the platform's community discovery
   * features, allowing users to find other members with shared interests in
   * economic and political topics, identify active contributors, explore the
   * community, and discover quality content creators. The public nature of this
   * endpoint encourages community exploration while maintaining strict privacy
   * boundaries.
   *
   * Rate limiting is enforced according to the platform's business rules to
   * prevent abuse of the search functionality. Guest users are limited to 20
   * searches per hour, while authenticated members have higher limits (100
   * searches per hour). Search queries are validated for length (1-200
   * characters) and sanitized to prevent injection attacks. Excessive search
   * activity triggers temporary restrictions.
   *
   * The operation returns paginated results with 25 members per page by
   * default, configurable through request parameters up to a maximum of 100
   * members per page. Each member record in the response includes only public
   * profile information: username, display name (if set), bio excerpt, account
   * creation date, reputation score, account status, email verification status
   * (boolean), role indicators, avatar URL, location, and website for display
   * purposes. Private information including email addresses, password hashes,
   * IP addresses, and detailed activity logs are completely excluded from all
   * response payloads.
