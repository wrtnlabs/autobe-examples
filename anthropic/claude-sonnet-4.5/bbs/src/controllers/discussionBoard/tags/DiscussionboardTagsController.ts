  /**
   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of discussion board tags.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of tags from the discussion board
   * system. This operation provides advanced search capabilities for finding
   * tags based on multiple criteria including partial name matching, tag status
   * filtering, usage statistics, and creation date ranges.
   *
   * Tags serve as a critical content organization mechanism in the discussion
   * board, complementing the primary category structure. Each tag can be
   * applied to multiple discussion topics (up to 5 tags per topic per business
   * rules), and users can follow tags to receive notifications about new
   * discussions with those tags. This operation supports tag browsing, popular
   * tag discovery, and tag management workflows.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive pagination with configurable page
   * sizes and sorting options. Users can sort tags by name (alphabetically),
   * creation date, usage count (number of topics tagged), or recent usage count
   * (trending tags). The search functionality includes partial text matching on
   * tag names and descriptions using PostgreSQL full-text search with trigram
   * indexing for performance.
   *
   * Security considerations include rate limiting for search operations (30
   * searches per minute per user for guests, higher limits for authenticated
   * users). Tag visibility respects the tag status field - only active tags are
   * visible to regular users, while moderators and administrators can view
   * pending_review, disabled, and merged tags for management purposes.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the discussion_board_tags table as defined
   * in the Prisma schema (schema-05-engagement.prisma), incorporating tag
   * properties including name, description, status, and timestamps. The
   * response includes tag statistics aggregated from the
   * mv_discussion_board_tag_statistics materialized view when available,
   * providing usage_count, recent_usage_count, follower_count, and total_votes
   * for each tag without expensive real-time aggregation.
   *
   * Related operations that work together with this endpoint include GET
   * /tags/{tagId} for retrieving detailed information about a specific tag, GET
   * /topics for finding topics associated with selected tags, and PATCH /topics
   * for advanced topic search that includes tag filtering. Users typically use
   * this operation to discover popular tags, explore tag categories, and select
   * tags for following or filtering discussion content.

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information about a specific discussion board tag by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve comprehensive information about a single tag from the discussion
   * board system by specifying the tag's unique identifier in the path
   * parameter. This operation returns complete tag details including metadata,
   * statistics, and usage information.
   *
   * Tags are user-generated labels that provide additional categorization
   * beyond primary discussion categories. Each tag has properties including a
   * unique name (2-30 characters, normalized to lowercase), an optional
   * description explaining usage guidelines, and a status indicating its
   * lifecycle state (active, pending_review, disabled, merged). Tags support
   * cross-category content discovery, allowing users to find related
   * discussions across Economics and Politics categories through shared tags.
   *
   * The operation returns detailed tag information incorporating data from both
   * the discussion_board_tags base table and the
   * mv_discussion_board_tag_statistics materialized view. The statistics
   * provide aggregated metrics including total usage count (number of topics
   * tagged), recent usage count (topics tagged in last 7 days for trending
   * analysis), follower count (users following the tag), and total votes (sum
   * of all votes on tagged topics). These denormalized statistics enable
   * efficient tag cloud generation and popular tag displays without expensive
   * real-time aggregation queries.
   *
   * Security and visibility considerations ensure that tag access respects the
   * tag status field. Active tags are visible to all users including guests.
   * Tags with pending_review or disabled status are only visible to moderators
   * and administrators. Merged tags may redirect to the canonical tag they were
   * consolidated into. The operation validates that the specified tagId exists
   * and returns appropriate error messages for non-existent or inaccessible
   * tags.
   *
   * This operation integrates with related tag functionality including
   * following tags (users can subscribe to receive notifications about new
   * topics with this tag), filtering discussions by tags (finding all topics
   * associated with this tag), and tag management workflows (moderators
   * reviewing and approving user-created tags). The tag detail view helps users
   * understand tag meaning and appropriateness before applying it to their own
   * discussion topics.
   *
   * Related operations include PATCH /tags for searching and browsing all
   * available tags, GET /topics for retrieving discussions associated with this
   * tag through topic_tags junction table, and POST /tags/{tagId}/follow for
   * users to subscribe to tag updates. This operation is commonly used when
   * users click on a tag from a discussion topic to learn more about that tag
   * before deciding to follow it or explore related discussions.
   *

   * @param tagId Unique identifier of the target discussion board tag
