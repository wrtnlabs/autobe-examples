  /**
   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of discussion board
   * categories.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered list of discussion board categories from
   * the discussion_board_categories table. This operation provides advanced
   * search and filtering capabilities for discovering and organizing categories
   * used to classify economic and political discussion topics.
   *
   * The endpoint supports full-text search across category names and
   * descriptions, enabling users to find relevant categories quickly. Users can
   * filter categories by hierarchical level (top-level categories like
   * Economics and Politics versus subcategories like Macroeconomics), active
   * status (to show only currently available categories), and parent-child
   * relationships to navigate the category taxonomy.
   *
   * Sorting options include display_order (the default administrative
   * ordering), topic_count (to identify most active categories), creation date,
   * and alphabetical ordering. Pagination allows efficient browsing of the
   * complete category catalog with configurable page sizes.
   *
   * This operation serves multiple use cases across the platform. During topic
   * creation, members use this endpoint to browse available categories and
   * select the appropriate classification for their discussion. In category
   * browsing interfaces, users explore the organizational structure to find
   * discussions of interest. Administrators use filtered views to manage the
   * category hierarchy, identify underutilized categories, and organize the
   * platform's content taxonomy.
   *
   * The response includes essential category metadata: unique identifier, name,
   * slug (for URL-friendly routing), description, hierarchical position
   * (parent_category_id), display ordering, active status, and topic count. The
   * topic_count field provides immediate visibility into category usage and
   * helps users identify where active discussions are occurring.
   *
   * Security considerations include public accessibility (guests and all
   * authenticated roles can browse categories) since category information is
   * non-sensitive organizational metadata. Rate limiting applies to prevent
   * abuse, and response caching improves performance for this frequently
   * accessed data.
   *
   * This operation integrates closely with the Discussion Management
   * requirements defined in 03-discussion-management.md, specifically the
   * Category System Overview and Category Browsing sections. It enables the
   * category-based content organization that is fundamental to the platform's
   * structure for economic and political discourse.

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information for a specific discussion board category by
   * ID.
   *
   * Retrieve complete details for a single discussion board category identified
   * by the categoryId path parameter. This operation accesses the
   * discussion_board_categories table to return comprehensive information about
   * a specific category used to organize economic and political discussion
   * topics.
   *
   * The operation returns the full category record including all metadata
   * fields: unique identifier, category name, URL-friendly slug, complete
   * description text, hierarchical position (parent_category_id for
   * subcategories), display ordering value, active status flag, and current
   * topic count showing how many discussions are classified under this
   * category.
   *
   * For hierarchical categories (subcategories like Macroeconomics under
   * Economics), the response includes the parent_category_id which clients can
   * use to display breadcrumb navigation or hierarchical category paths. The
   * description field contains the full category explanation (potentially
   * several hundred characters) that helps users understand the category's
   * scope and what types of discussions belong there.
   *
   * The topic_count field provides real-time visibility into category usage,
   * helping users identify active discussion areas and enabling administrators
   * to monitor category health. The display_order field indicates the
   * category's position in organized listings, supporting custom category
   * ordering beyond alphabetical sorting.
   *
   * This operation serves several critical use cases. During topic creation,
   * users may click on a category to view its detailed description before
   * confirming their selection, ensuring they choose the most appropriate
   * category. Category detail pages display this information to users browsing
   * the organizational structure. Administrative interfaces use this endpoint
   * to load category data for editing and management workflows.
   *
   * Security and access control allow public visibility since category
   * information is non-sensitive organizational metadata. Guests and all
   * authenticated users can view category details. The operation validates that
   * the requested category exists in the database, returning appropriate error
   * responses for invalid UUIDs, non-existent categories, or soft-deleted
   * categories (deleted_at is not null).
   *
   * Performance expectations require sub-second response times for individual
   * category retrieval, typically under 500 milliseconds. Caching strategies
   * can optimize repeated requests for popular categories. The operation
   * integrates with the category system requirements defined in
   * 03-discussion-management.md, specifically supporting the Category
   * Navigation and Category Structure sections.
   *
   * Error handling includes specific responses for common failure scenarios:
   * invalid UUID format in the categoryId parameter (400 Bad Request), category
   * not found (404 Not Found), and soft-deleted categories that should not be
   * displayed (404 Not Found or 410 Gone depending on implementation
   * approach).

   * @param categoryId Unique identifier of the target discussion board category
