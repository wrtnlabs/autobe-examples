  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered moderation queue reports with pagination and
   * priority sorting.
   *
   * This operation provides moderators and administrators with comprehensive
   * access to the content moderation queue, enabling efficient review and
   * management of reported content. The moderation queue is the central
   * workflow hub for maintaining community standards and enforcing guidelines
   * for civil discourse on economic and political topics.
   *
   * The operation supports sophisticated filtering capabilities essential for
   * effective moderation queue management. Moderators can filter reports by
   * current status (pending for unassigned reports, under_review for reports
   * actively being investigated, resolved for completed reviews, or dismissed
   * for reports determined to be without merit). Violation category filtering
   * allows moderators to focus on specific types of guideline violations such
   * as personal attacks, hate speech, misinformation, spam, offensive language,
   * off-topic content, threats, doxxing, or trolling. Severity level filtering
   * (critical, high, medium, low) enables prioritization of the most serious
   * violations requiring immediate attention. Additional filters include
   * assigned moderator (to view reports assigned to specific team members or
   * unassigned reports), date range for investigating reports from specific
   * time periods, and report count (number of times the same content has been
   * reported by different users, indicating community consensus on
   * violations).
   *
   * The default sorting algorithm prioritizes reports using a composite score
   * that considers severity level (critical violations appear first), multiple
   * reports on the same content (community agreement elevates priority), and
   * time in queue (older unresolved reports gradually increase in priority to
   * ensure timely review). Alternative sorting options allow moderators to view
   * the queue chronologically (oldest unresolved first, newest first), by
   * severity only, or by report count. This flexible sorting ensures moderators
   * can work through the queue efficiently while ensuring critical violations
   * receive immediate attention.
   *
   * Pagination controls enable moderators to navigate large moderation queues
   * effectively. The operation returns comprehensive report information for
   * each queue item including report ID, submission timestamp, content preview
   * (first 100 characters of reported content), violation category and
   * severity, number of reports on this content, current status, assigned
   * moderator (if any), and time in queue. This information enables moderators
   * to quickly assess reports and prioritize their review workflow.
   *
   * Security and permission enforcement are critical for this operation. Only
   * users with moderator or administrator roles can access the moderation
   * queue. Regular members cannot view reports or access moderation interfaces.
   * When a moderator accesses the queue, they see all pending and under-review
   * reports across the platform. Administrators have unrestricted access to the
   * complete queue including resolved and dismissed reports for audit and
   * oversight purposes. The operation respects role-based access control
   * defined in the User Roles and Authentication requirements.
   *
   * The operation integrates with multiple moderation workflow components.
   * Report data references the discussion_board_reports table which contains
   * foreign keys to reported content (discussion_board_topics or
   * discussion_board_replies), the reporting user (discussion_board_members),
   * and the assigned moderator (discussion_board_moderators). The operation
   * provides the foundation for subsequent moderation actions including content
   * review, warning issuance, content hiding or removal, user suspension, and
   * report resolution. All data returned respects soft delete patterns,
   * excluding reports with deleted_at timestamps unless explicitly requested by
   * administrators for audit purposes.
   *
   * Performance requirements mandate that the moderation queue loads within 2
   * seconds even with thousands of pending reports. Efficient database indexing
   * on status, severity, assigned moderator, and creation timestamp columns
   * supports rapid filtering and sorting. The operation uses pagination to
   * limit result set sizes, preventing performance degradation as the report
   * volume grows. Real-time updates are not required for this operation;
   * moderators can refresh the queue manually to see newly submitted reports.
   *
   * The operation supports the platform's commitment to transparent, fair, and
   * timely content moderation. By providing powerful filtering and sorting
   * tools, the system enables moderators to work through the queue efficiently,
   * address critical violations immediately, and maintain consistent response
   * times. The comprehensive report information displayed supports informed
   * moderation decisions while the audit trail (created through subsequent
   * moderation action operations) ensures accountability for all moderation
   * activities.
