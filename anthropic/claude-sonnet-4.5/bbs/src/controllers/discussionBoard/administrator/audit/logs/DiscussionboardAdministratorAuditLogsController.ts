   * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated audit log entries for system
   * activity tracking.
   *
   * This operation provides administrators with comprehensive access to the
   * platform's audit trail, retrieving filtered and paginated records from the
   * discussion_board_audit_logs table. The audit log captures all significant
   * user and system actions across the platform including topic creation, reply
   * posting, content editing and deletion, voting activity, user profile
   * modifications, and administrative configuration changes. This operation is
   * essential for compliance auditing, security incident investigation, user
   * activity analysis, and platform governance.
   *
   * The operation supports extensive filtering capabilities to help
   * administrators locate specific audit events efficiently. Filters include
   * user_id to track specific user activities, action_type to find particular
   * operation categories (topic_created, reply_posted, vote_cast,
   * profile_updated, content_deleted), entity_type and entity_id to investigate
   * actions on specific platform entities, date range filtering for time-bound
   * investigations, and IP address filtering for security analysis and fraud
   * detection.
   *
   * Security considerations mandate that only users with the administrator role
   * can access audit logs, as these records contain comprehensive platform
   * activity data including deleted content snapshots, user behavioral
   * patterns, and sensitive security information. The operation implements
   * strict role-based access control and validates administrator authentication
   * before returning any audit data.
   *
   * The response includes detailed audit log entries with action descriptions,
   * entity information, metadata JSON blobs containing before/after values and
   * affected fields, IP addresses and user agents for security tracking, and
   * precise timestamps for activity timeline reconstruction. Results are
   * paginated to handle the large volume of audit data efficiently, with
   * default page sizes optimized for administrative review workflows.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the security monitoring system by providing
   * the data foundation for detecting suspicious patterns, investigating
   * security incidents, tracking moderation actions, and generating compliance
   * reports. Administrators use this audit trail to verify platform integrity,
   * investigate user complaints, analyze moderator performance, and ensure
   * consistent policy enforcement.
   *
   * Related operations include security log retrieval (PATCH /security/logs)
   * for authentication-specific events, moderation audit log access (PATCH
   * /moderation/audit-logs) for moderation-specific actions, and search history
   * analysis (PATCH /search/history) for understanding user information needs.
   * The general audit log provides the broadest activity view across all
   * platform operations.
