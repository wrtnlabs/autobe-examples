  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered security audit logs for monitoring and
   * incident investigation.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive filtered and paginated list of security audit log
   * entries from the discussion_board_security_logs table. This operation
   * provides administrators with powerful search and analysis capabilities for
   * investigating security incidents, monitoring authentication patterns,
   * identifying suspicious activities, and maintaining security compliance.
   *
   * Security logs capture critical security-relevant events including
   * successful and failed login attempts, account lockout incidents, permission
   * denial events, rate limit violations, suspicious activity patterns, and
   * potential security threats. Each log entry includes event type
   * classification, severity assessment, IP address tracking, user agent
   * information, descriptive context, and detailed metadata in JSON format.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive filtering options including event type
   * selection (login_success, login_failed, account_locked, permission_denied,
   * suspicious_activity, rate_limit_exceeded), severity level filtering (low,
   * medium, high, critical), date range queries for temporal analysis, user
   * identification for account-specific investigation, and IP address tracking
   * for identifying attack patterns or geographic threats.
   *
   * Administrators use this endpoint for multiple critical security functions:
   * investigating potential security breaches by analyzing failed login
   * patterns, monitoring for brute force attacks through repeated failure
   * analysis, identifying suspicious IP addresses showing attack behavior,
   * analyzing rate limit violations to detect abuse patterns, tracking account
   * lockout frequency to identify targeted accounts, generating security
   * compliance reports for audit requirements, and performing incident response
   * activities when security events are detected.
   *
   * Security considerations for this endpoint include strict administrator-only
   * access given the sensitive nature of security event data, comprehensive
   * audit logging of all security log access attempts to track who reviews
   * security data, rate limiting to prevent excessive query load on security
   * infrastructure, and careful filtering to prevent exposure of sensitive
   * system internals or security mechanisms that could aid attackers.
   *
   * The response includes paginated security log entries with full event
   * details, filtering metadata showing applied search criteria, aggregated
   * statistics for security event patterns, and sorting options by timestamp,
   * severity level, or event type to facilitate different analysis workflows.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria and filtering parameters for security audit log
   *   retrieval including event types, severity levels, date ranges, user
   *   filters, and IP address patterns
