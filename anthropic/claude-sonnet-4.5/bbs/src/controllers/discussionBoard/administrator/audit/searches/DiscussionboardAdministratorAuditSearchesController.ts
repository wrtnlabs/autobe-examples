   * Retrieve and filter paginated search history audit records for platform
   * analytics.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of search history
   * audit records from the platform. This operation provides administrators and
   * analysts with powerful tools to analyze user search behavior, identify
   * popular queries, detect zero-result searches, and optimize search
   * functionality for economic and political discussions.
   *
   * The search history audit trail captures every search query performed on the
   * platform, including the search text entered, filters applied (category,
   * date range, tags, vote thresholds), number of results returned, which
   * result was clicked, and session context. This rich dataset enables deep
   * analysis of user information needs and search effectiveness.
   *
   * Security considerations ensure that only administrators can access the
   * complete search history audit trail. Regular members cannot access other
   * users' search histories to protect privacy. The operation respects data
   * retention policies, typically showing search history from the last 90 days
   * for performance and privacy reasons, though administrators may access
   * extended historical data for compliance purposes.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the discussion_board_search_history table
   * from the Prisma schema, incorporating all available fields including
   * user_id (nullable for guest searches), search_query (the actual text
   * searched), filters_applied (JSON blob of filter parameters), results_count
   * (number of results returned), clicked_result_id (nullable UUID of clicked
   * result), session_id (nullable session tracking), and created_at timestamp.
   *
   * Filtering capabilities support complex queries to identify patterns such as
   * frequently searched terms that return zero results (indicating content
   * gaps), queries with high click-through rates (indicating good relevance),
   * queries with low engagement (indicating poor search quality), and
   * user-specific search behavior patterns. The response includes search query
   * summaries optimized for analytics dashboards and reporting interfaces.
   *
   * This operation is essential for continuous improvement of the search
   * experience, identification of trending topics users are seeking, detection
   * of search feature usage patterns, and data-driven decisions about content
   * creation priorities based on unmet user information needs.
