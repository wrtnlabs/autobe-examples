  /**
   * Search and retrieve filtered moderation audit logs for accountability and
   * appeal investigation.
   *
   * Retrieve a comprehensive filtered and paginated list of moderation audit
   * log entries from the discussion_board_moderation_audit_logs table. This
   * operation provides administrators with powerful tools for reviewing
   * moderation decisions, investigating user appeals, monitoring moderator
   * performance, and ensuring consistent application of community guidelines
   * across the platform.
   *
   * Moderation audit logs capture all moderation actions taken by moderators
   * and administrators including content hiding and removal, user warnings,
   * temporary suspensions, permanent bans, appeal approvals and denials, and
   * automated moderation actions. Each log entry records the moderator or
   * administrator identity who performed the action, the target user or content
   * affected, comprehensive reasoning for the decision, preserved content
   * snapshots for appeals investigation, and detailed metadata providing full
   * context for the moderation event.
   *
   * The operation supports extensive filtering capabilities including action
   * type filtering (content_hidden, content_removed, warning_issued,
   * user_suspended, user_banned, appeal_approved, appeal_denied), moderator
   * identity filtering to review specific moderator's decisions, target user
   * filtering for investigating moderation history of particular members, date
   * range queries for temporal pattern analysis, content type filtering to
   * focus on topic or reply moderation, and combined filters for complex audit
   * queries.
   *
   * Administrators rely on this endpoint for multiple critical moderation
   * oversight functions: reviewing moderator decisions for quality assurance
   * and consistency, investigating user appeals by examining original
   * moderation context and reasoning, monitoring moderator performance through
   * decision pattern analysis, identifying potential moderator bias or
   * inconsistent application of guidelines, generating transparency reports
   * showing moderation activity statistics, training new moderators by
   * providing examples of past decisions, and resolving disputes about content
   * removal or user sanctions.
   *
   * Accountability and transparency are paramount for this endpoint. The
   * moderation audit trail serves as the authoritative record for all content
   * governance activities, supporting the platform's commitment to fair and
   * consistent moderation. All moderation actions are permanently logged with
   * immutable records, moderator identities are tracked to enable performance
   * review, comprehensive reasoning is required for all moderation decisions,
   * content snapshots preserve the exact state at time of action, and metadata
   * provides full context for understanding each moderation event.
   *
   * The response includes paginated moderation audit entries with complete
   * action details, filtering metadata showing applied search criteria,
   * aggregated statistics for moderation patterns and trends, and sorting
   * options by timestamp, action type, or moderator identity to support
   * different audit and review workflows.
   *
   * Integration with the appeals system is critical as this endpoint provides
   * the foundational data for appeal investigations, allowing administrators to
   * review original moderation decisions with full context, examine moderator
   * reasoning, access preserved content snapshots, and make informed decisions
   * on whether to uphold, reverse, or modify contested moderation actions.
