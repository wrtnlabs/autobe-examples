  /**
   * Retrieve and filter active sessions for any user account (administrator
   * access).
   *
   * This operation retrieves a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of
   * active sessions for any specified user from the discussion_board_sessions
   * table. Unlike the member-scoped session retrieval, this administrator
   * operation can access session data for any user on the platform to support
   * security investigations, user support requests, and account monitoring.
   *
   * The operation supports advanced filtering capabilities to help
   * administrators find specific sessions based on various criteria including
   * device type (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet), browser information (Chrome,
   * Firefox, Safari, etc.), approximate geographic location, IP address
   * patterns, login timestamp ranges, and last activity timeframe.
   * Administrators can search for sessions that meet multiple filter criteria
   * simultaneously to identify suspicious login patterns, unusual device usage,
   * or potential account compromises.
   *
   * Each session record in the response includes comprehensive metadata
   * essential for security assessment. This includes the device type extracted
   * from the user agent string, browser name and version information, the IP
   * address from which the session was created, an approximate geographic
   * location based on IP geolocation (city-level precision), the timestamp when
   * the user logged in to create this session, the timestamp of the most recent
   * activity in this session, the session's expiration timestamp, and whether
   * the session is currently active or has been revoked.
   *
   * Security considerations are critical for this administrative operation.
   * Only users with administrator privileges can access this endpoint, as it
   * provides visibility into any user's session data. This access is necessary
   * for legitimate security investigations (detecting account takeovers,
   * investigating suspicious activity patterns) and user support (helping users
   * who report unauthorized access). However, the sensitive nature of session
   * data requires that administrator access is logged in security audit
   * trails.
   *
   * The operation integrates with the multi-device session management
   * functionality and administrator security tools defined in the User Roles
   * and Authentication document. Administrators can use this data to assist
   * users with session management issues, investigate security incidents,
   * identify patterns of abuse or unauthorized access, and take appropriate
   * action such as revoking suspicious sessions or implementing additional
   * security measures for compromised accounts.
   *
   * Pagination is essential given that users may have numerous historical
   * session records, and administrators may be reviewing session data across
   * multiple users. The response should include pagination metadata indicating
   * the current page, total number of sessions matching the filters, and page
   * size. Sorting options allow administrators to organize sessions by most
   * recent activity, login timestamp, or other criteria to quickly identify
   * relevant sessions for their investigation or support task.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Unique identifier of the user whose sessions are being
   *   retrieved by the administrator
   * @param body Filter criteria and pagination parameters for retrieving user
   *   sessions including device type, location, activity timeframe, and sorting
   *   preferences
