  /**
   * Create a new moderation action record documenting moderator or
   * administrator enforcement.
   *
   * Create a comprehensive moderation action record when a moderator or
   * administrator takes enforcement action against content or a user account on
   * the discussion board platform. This operation records the complete details
   * of moderation decisions including content removal, user warnings,
   * suspensions, bans, content restoration, and report dismissals.
   *
   * The operation operates on the discussion_board_moderation_actions table
   * from the Prisma schema and is invoked as part of the moderation workflow.
   * When a moderator reviews reported content in the moderation queue and
   * determines that action is necessary, or when an administrator takes direct
   * enforcement action, this operation creates the permanent audit record of
   * that decision.
   *
   * Required information includes the action_type (hide_content,
   * delete_content, issue_warning, suspend_user, ban_user, restore_content, or
   * dismiss_report), the target_member_id identifying the user affected by the
   * action, and a detailed reason explaining the decision (minimum 20
   * characters for accountability). The operation also captures which moderator
   * or administrator performed the action, the violation category if
   * applicable, the related report that triggered the review (if action
   * resulted from a report), and the specific content (topic or reply) that was
   * moderated.
   *
   * Critically, the operation preserves a content_snapshot field that captures
   * the exact state of the content at the time of moderation action. This
   * immutable snapshot ensures that even if the user subsequently edits or
   * deletes the content, the moderation decision can be reviewed and appealed
   * based on what the content actually said at the time of the violation. This
   * supports the appeals process and ensures moderation accountability.
   *
   * The operation integrates with related moderation systems by creating the
   * foundational moderation_action record that warnings, suspensions, and bans
   * reference through their moderation_action_id foreign keys. This establishes
   * the complete chain of evidence from initial report through moderation
   * decision to enforcement action and potential appeal.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict role-based access control where only
   * users with moderator or administrator roles can create moderation actions.
   * The operation validates that the acting user has permission to moderate
   * content and that the target user and content exist before creating the
   * record. All moderation actions are immediately logged to the moderation
   * audit trail for oversight.
   *
   * The response returns the complete moderation action record with all fields
   * populated, timestamps recorded, and relationships established. This allows
   * the calling code to immediately create related records (warnings,
   * suspensions) or trigger notifications to the affected user explaining what
   * action was taken and why.
   *
   * Validation rules enforced include verifying the action_type is one of the
   * allowed values, ensuring the reason meets minimum length requirements,
   * confirming at least one of moderator_id or administrator_id is provided
   * (identifying who performed the action), validating that content references
   * exist if content-specific action is taken, and preserving accurate content
   * snapshots for topics or replies being moderated.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Moderation action creation data including action type, target
   *   user and content, violation details, and moderator reasoning

  /**
   * Retrieve filtered and paginated moderation queue for moderator review.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of content reports and moderation
   * actions from the moderation queue. This operation provides moderators and
   * administrators with comprehensive access to reports requiring review,
   * including advanced filtering by status (pending, under_review, resolved,
   * dismissed), severity level (critical, high, medium, low), violation
   * category, assigned moderator, and date ranges. The operation supports
   * complex search criteria to help moderators efficiently find and prioritize
   * reports.
   *
   * This operation queries the discussion_board_reports table from the Prisma
   * schema, joining with related tables to provide complete context including
   * reported content previews, reporter information, and existing moderation
   * actions. The moderation queue displays reports with fields such as
   * violation_category, severity_level, status, reporter_explanation,
   * assigned_moderator_id, and resolution details. The system prioritizes
   * critical severity violations (hate speech, threats, doxxing) at the top of
   * the queue, followed by high severity violations, then reports with multiple
   * flags from different users.
   *
   * Security considerations ensure only authenticated moderators and
   * administrators can access the moderation queue. Moderators see all
   * unassigned reports plus reports assigned to them, while administrators see
   * all reports across all moderators. The operation implements the moderation
   * workflow requirements where reports progress from pending to under_review
   * when assigned, then to resolved or dismissed based on moderator decisions.
   *
   * This operation integrates closely with PUT /reports/{reportId} which
   * moderators use to update individual reports after reviewing them in this
   * queue. The pagination and filtering capabilities ensure moderators can
   * efficiently process high volumes of reports while prioritizing urgent
   * violations. Response includes report metadata, content snapshots, reporter
   * context, and suggested actions based on violation patterns.

   * provides complete visibility into moderation decisions made by moderators
   * and administrators across the discussion board platform.
   *
   * The operation returns detailed information from the

   *
   * This operation is critical for moderation transparency and accountability.
   * Users who receive moderation actions can view the details to understand
   * what guideline was violated and why the action was taken. Moderators use
   * this to review their own past decisions and ensure consistency in
   * enforcement. Administrators access this information when reviewing appeals
   * or investigating moderation patterns.
   *
   * The response includes related entities such as the related report that
   * triggered the action (if applicable), the specific content (topic or reply)
   * that was moderated with preserved content snapshots, and information about
   * any subsequent reversal if the action was overturned on appeal or
   * administrative review.
   *
   * Security considerations include role-based access control where regular
