  /**
   * Search and retrieve all appeals across all users for administrative review
   * with filtering and pagination.
   *
   * This operation retrieves a filtered and paginated list of all appeals
   * submitted by any member contesting moderation decisions on the discussion
   * board platform, providing administrators with complete visibility into the
   * appeals queue. Appeals represent a critical component of the platform's
   * fair and transparent moderation system, and this administrative endpoint
   * enables comprehensive appeal management and review across the entire user
   * base.
   *
   * The operation supports comprehensive search and filtering capabilities
   * including filtering by appeal status (pending_review, under_review,
   * approved, denied, modified), submission date ranges, specific member who
   * submitted the appeal, reviewing administrator assignment, decision outcome,
   * and the type of moderation action being appealed (warning, suspension, ban,
   * content removal). Administrators can sort results by submission date,
   * review date, status, or member to organize their review workflow.
   *
   * For administrators accessing this endpoint, the operation returns appeals
   * across all users without member-based filtering, serving as the primary
   * interface for the administrative appeal review queue. Administrators use
   * this endpoint to identify pending appeals requiring review, track appeals
   * currently under review by specific administrators, analyze appeal patterns
   * and outcomes across the platform, and ensure timely processing of appeals
   * within the target review timelines specified in moderation system
   * requirements (7 days for warning appeals, 3 days for suspension appeals, 14
   * days for ban appeals).
   *
   * The response includes complete appeal information for each result: the
   * appeal explanation provided by the member (100-1000 characters), any
   * additional evidence or context submitted, the current appeal status, the
   * assigned reviewing administrator (if applicable), the administrator's
   * decision (uphold, reverse, or modify), detailed decision reasoning,
   * descriptions of any corrective actions taken for approved appeals (warning
   * removal, suspension lift, account restoration), and complete timestamp
   * tracking from submission through review to resolution.
   *
   * Each appeal result includes references to the underlying moderation action
   * being contested, allowing administrators to view the complete context
   * including the original violation, moderator reasoning, content snapshots,
   * and the full moderation history that led to the appeal. This comprehensive
   * context supports informed appeal decisions and maintains transparency
   * throughout the appeals process.
   *
   * The operation supports pagination for efficient handling of large appeal
   * volumes across the entire platform, with configurable page sizes and
   * navigation through multi-page result sets. Sorting options enable
   * administrators to prioritize appeals by urgency (oldest pending first),
   * recency (newest submissions first), assigned reviewer, or resolution status
   * to organize their administrative workflow effectively.
   *
   * This search operation integrates with the appeal submission workflow, the
   * moderation action system, and the notification system to provide
   * administrators with complete appeal management capabilities. When
   * administrators review appeals and make decisions, they can access complete
   * moderation context, user history, and relevant content to make fair,
   * informed determinations. When appeals are approved and decisions are
   * reversed, the system automatically triggers corrective actions and sends
   * notifications to affected users.
   *
   * Security and privacy considerations include validation that the requesting
   * user has administrator role with proper permissions to review all appeals,
   * comprehensive audit logging of all administrative appeal searches and
   * reviews for accountability and compliance reporting as specified in the
   * moderation audit requirements, and appropriate handling of sensitive
   * moderation information in responses.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria, filters, and pagination parameters for appeal
   *   queries including status filters, member filters, administrator
   *   assignment, date ranges, and sorting preferences
