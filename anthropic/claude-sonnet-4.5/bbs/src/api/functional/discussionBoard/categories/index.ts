/**
 * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of discussion board
 * categories.
 *
 * Retrieve a comprehensive, filtered list of discussion board categories from
 * the discussion_board_categories table. This operation provides advanced
 * search and filtering capabilities for discovering and organizing categories
 * used to classify economic and political discussion topics.
 *
 * The endpoint supports full-text search across category names and
 * descriptions, enabling users to find relevant categories quickly. Users can
 * filter categories by hierarchical level (top-level categories like Economics
 * and Politics versus subcategories like Macroeconomics), active status (to
 * show only currently available categories), and parent-child relationships to
 * navigate the category taxonomy.
 *
 * Sorting options include display_order (the default administrative ordering),
 * topic_count (to identify most active categories), creation date, and
 * alphabetical ordering. Pagination allows efficient browsing of the complete
 * category catalog with configurable page sizes.
 *
 * This operation serves multiple use cases across the platform. During topic
 * creation, members use this endpoint to browse available categories and select
 * the appropriate classification for their discussion. In category browsing
 * interfaces, users explore the organizational structure to find discussions of
 * interest. Administrators use filtered views to manage the category hierarchy,
 * identify underutilized categories, and organize the platform's content
 * taxonomy.
 *
 * The response includes essential category metadata: unique identifier, name,
 * slug (for URL-friendly routing), description, hierarchical position
 * (parent_category_id), display ordering, active status, and topic count. The
 * topic_count field provides immediate visibility into category usage and helps
 * users identify where active discussions are occurring.
 *
 * Security considerations include public accessibility (guests and all
 * authenticated roles can browse categories) since category information is
 * non-sensitive organizational metadata. Rate limiting applies to prevent
 * abuse, and response caching improves performance for this frequently accessed
 * data.
 *
 * This operation integrates closely with the Discussion Management requirements
 * defined in 03-discussion-management.md, specifically the Category System
 * Overview and Category Browsing sections. It enables the category-based
 * content organization that is fundamental to the platform's structure for
 * economic and political discourse.

/**
 * Retrieve detailed information for a specific discussion board category by ID.
 *
 * Retrieve complete details for a single discussion board category identified
 * by the categoryId path parameter. This operation accesses the
 * discussion_board_categories table to return comprehensive information about a
 * specific category used to organize economic and political discussion topics.
 *
 * The operation returns the full category record including all metadata fields:
 * unique identifier, category name, URL-friendly slug, complete description
 * text, hierarchical position (parent_category_id for subcategories), display
 * ordering value, active status flag, and current topic count showing how many
 * discussions are classified under this category.
 *
 * For hierarchical categories (subcategories like Macroeconomics under
 * Economics), the response includes the parent_category_id which clients can
 * use to display breadcrumb navigation or hierarchical category paths. The
 * description field contains the full category explanation (potentially several
 * hundred characters) that helps users understand the category's scope and what
 * types of discussions belong there.
 *
 * The topic_count field provides real-time visibility into category usage,
 * helping users identify active discussion areas and enabling administrators to
 * monitor category health. The display_order field indicates the category's
 * position in organized listings, supporting custom category ordering beyond
 * alphabetical sorting.
 *
 * This operation serves several critical use cases. During topic creation,
 * users may click on a category to view its detailed description before
 * confirming their selection, ensuring they choose the most appropriate
 * category. Category detail pages display this information to users browsing
 * the organizational structure. Administrative interfaces use this endpoint to
 * load category data for editing and management workflows.
 *
 * Security and access control allow public visibility since category
 * information is non-sensitive organizational metadata. Guests and all
 * authenticated users can view category details. The operation validates that
 * the requested category exists in the database, returning appropriate error
 * responses for invalid UUIDs, non-existent categories, or soft-deleted
 * categories (deleted_at is not null).
 *
 * Performance expectations require sub-second response times for individual
 * category retrieval, typically under 500 milliseconds. Caching strategies can
 * optimize repeated requests for popular categories. The operation integrates
 * with the category system requirements defined in 03-discussion-management.md,
 * specifically supporting the Category Navigation and Category Structure
 * sections.
 *
 * Error handling includes specific responses for common failure scenarios:
 * invalid UUID format in the categoryId parameter (400 Bad Request), category
 * not found (404 Not Found), and soft-deleted categories that should not be
 * displayed (404 Not Found or 410 Gone depending on implementation approach).
