/**
 * Search and retrieve filtered security audit logs for monitoring and incident
 * investigation.
 *
 * Retrieve a comprehensive filtered and paginated list of security audit log
 * entries from the discussion_board_security_logs table. This operation
 * provides administrators with powerful search and analysis capabilities for
 * investigating security incidents, monitoring authentication patterns,
 * identifying suspicious activities, and maintaining security compliance.
 *
 * Security logs capture critical security-relevant events including successful
 * and failed login attempts, account lockout incidents, permission denial
 * events, rate limit violations, suspicious activity patterns, and potential
 * security threats. Each log entry includes event type classification, severity
 * assessment, IP address tracking, user agent information, descriptive context,
 * and detailed metadata in JSON format.
 *
 * The operation supports comprehensive filtering options including event type
 * selection (login_success, login_failed, account_locked, permission_denied,
 * suspicious_activity, rate_limit_exceeded), severity level filtering (low,
 * medium, high, critical), date range queries for temporal analysis, user
 * identification for account-specific investigation, and IP address tracking
 * for identifying attack patterns or geographic threats.
 *
 * Administrators use this endpoint for multiple critical security functions:
 * investigating potential security breaches by analyzing failed login patterns,
 * monitoring for brute force attacks through repeated failure analysis,
 * identifying suspicious IP addresses showing attack behavior, analyzing rate
 * limit violations to detect abuse patterns, tracking account lockout frequency
 * to identify targeted accounts, generating security compliance reports for
 * audit requirements, and performing incident response activities when security
 * events are detected.
 *
 * Security considerations for this endpoint include strict administrator-only
 * access given the sensitive nature of security event data, comprehensive audit
 * logging of all security log access attempts to track who reviews security
 * data, rate limiting to prevent excessive query load on security
 * infrastructure, and careful filtering to prevent exposure of sensitive system
 * internals or security mechanisms that could aid attackers.
 *
 * The response includes paginated security log entries with full event details,
 * filtering metadata showing applied search criteria, aggregated statistics for
 * security event patterns, and sorting options by timestamp, severity level, or
 * event type to facilitate different analysis workflows.
