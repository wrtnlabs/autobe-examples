/**
 * Create a new tag in the discussion board tag vocabulary for content
 * categorization.
 *
 * This operation creates a new tag entry in the discussion_board_tags table,
 * enabling users to categorize and discover discussion topics through tag-based
 * filtering and search. Tags serve as secondary organizational metadata
 * complementing the primary category structure (Economics and Politics
 * categories).
 *
 * The tag creation process validates all input against business rules defined
 * in the requirements. Tag names must be between 2 and 30 characters in length,
 * contain only alphanumeric characters with spaces and hyphens, and be unique
 * across the entire tag vocabulary. The system normalizes tag names to
 * lowercase to ensure consistency and prevent duplicate tags with slight case
 * variations.
 *
 * When a moderator creates a tag, the system sets the initial status to
 * 'pending_review' to allow administrator oversight of the tag vocabulary. When
 * an administrator creates a tag, the status is set directly to 'active',
 * making it immediately available for use. This approval workflow maintains tag
 * quality and prevents the proliferation of redundant or inappropriate tags.
 *
 * Optionally, the creator can provide a description field explaining what the
 * tag represents and when to use it, helping users apply tags consistently
 * across discussions. The description supports clear tag semantics and reduces
 * confusion in tag application.
 *
 * Upon successful creation, the system generates a unique identifier, records
 * creation and update timestamps, and returns the complete tag object. The new
 * tag becomes searchable and available for suggestion in the topic creation
 * interface once its status reaches 'active'.
 *
 * This operation requires proper authentication and role-based authorization.
 * Only users with moderator or administrator roles can create new tags,
 * preventing tag spam from regular members while allowing community leaders to
 * expand the tag vocabulary organically as discussion topics evolve.

/**
 * Update an existing tag's name, description, or status in the discussion
 * board.
 *
 * This operation modifies an existing tag entry in the discussion_board_tags
 * table, allowing moderators and administrators to maintain tag quality,
 * clarify tag semantics, and manage the tag lifecycle. Tag updates are
 * essential for evolving the tag vocabulary as community discussions develop
 * and new topics emerge.
 *
 * The tag update process supports modifying three core attributes: name,
 * description, and status. When updating the tag name, the system validates
 * that the new name meets all naming requirements (2-30 characters,
 * alphanumeric with spaces and hyphens) and remains unique across the entire
 * tag vocabulary. The system normalizes updated names to lowercase to maintain
 * consistency with existing tag conventions.
 *
 * Description updates allow moderators to clarify what a tag represents and
 * provide guidance on when to use it. This helps users apply tags consistently
 * and reduces ambiguity in tag semantics. Descriptions are optional but
 * recommended for frequently used tags to improve user understanding.
 *
 * Status updates control the tag lifecycle. Moderators can change status from
 * 'pending_review' to 'active' to approve new tags for general use. Tags can be
 * disabled by setting status to 'disabled', which hides them from tag selection
 * interfaces while preserving existing tag associations on topics. Tags can be
 * marked as 'merged' when consolidating duplicate or similar tags, indicating
 * the tag has been superseded by another preferred tag.
 *
 * The operation validates that the specified tag exists by checking the tagId
 * path parameter against the discussion_board_tags table. If the tag is not
 * found or has been soft-deleted (deleted_at is not null), the operation
 * returns an appropriate error response.
 *
 * When a tag is successfully updated, the system automatically updates the
 * updated_at timestamp to track when modifications occurred. This timestamp is
 * used for audit trail and tracking tag evolution over time. Existing
 * topic_tags associations are preservedâ€”topics previously tagged with this tag
 * maintain their associations even when the tag name or description changes.
 *
 * Security considerations include validating that the requesting user has
 * moderator or administrator role privileges. The operation logs tag updates in
 * the audit trail for accountability. Tag updates should be performed
 * judiciously as they affect all topics currently using the tag.
 *
 * Related operations that work in conjunction with tag updates include tag
 * creation (POST /tags), tag-based topic discovery (GET /topics filtered by
 * tags), and tag following (members tracking specific tags for personalized
 * content). The tag update operation ensures the tag vocabulary remains
 * accurate, organized, and aligned with community discussion patterns.

/**
 * Soft delete a tag from the discussion board.
 *
 * This operation performs a soft delete on a tag from the discussion board
 * platform by setting the deleted_at timestamp in the discussion_board_tags
 * table. The operation validates that the tag exists and is not currently in
 * use before proceeding with the soft deletion.
 *
 * Security considerations require that only administrators can delete tags, as
 * this affects the platform's organizational taxonomy and content
 * categorization structure. The operation verifies administrator authentication
 * through JWT token validation before processing the deletion request.
 *
 * The deletion process checks whether the tag is currently associated with any
 * discussion topics through the discussion_board_topic_tags junction table. If
 * the tag is in use, the deletion is rejected to maintain referential integrity
 * and prevent confusion from tags disappearing from active topics.
 * Administrators must first remove or reassign the tag from all topics before
 * deletion can proceed.
 *
 * This is a soft deletion operation that marks the tag as deleted by setting
 * the deleted_at timestamp while preserving the tag record in the database. The
 * discussion_board_tags table in the Prisma schema includes a deleted_at field
 * for soft deletion support. The tag is hidden from active use but preserved
 * for audit trail and potential recovery within the platform's 30-day retention
 * policy. Deleted tags can be recovered by administrators within the retention
 * window if needed, or they are permanently removed after the retention period
 * expires.
 *
 * Related operations include browsing all tags to identify unused or redundant
 * tags that are candidates for removal, and viewing tag usage information
 * before making deletion decisions.
