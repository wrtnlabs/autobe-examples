/**
 * Search and retrieve all appeals across all users for administrative review
 * with filtering and pagination.
 *
 * This operation retrieves a filtered and paginated list of all appeals
 * submitted by any member contesting moderation decisions on the discussion
 * board platform, providing administrators with complete visibility into the
 * appeals queue. Appeals represent a critical component of the platform's fair
 * and transparent moderation system, and this administrative endpoint enables
 * comprehensive appeal management and review across the entire user base.
 *
 * The operation supports comprehensive search and filtering capabilities
 * including filtering by appeal status (pending_review, under_review, approved,
 * denied, modified), submission date ranges, specific member who submitted the
 * appeal, reviewing administrator assignment, decision outcome, and the type of
 * moderation action being appealed (warning, suspension, ban, content removal).
 * Administrators can sort results by submission date, review date, status, or
 * member to organize their review workflow.
 *
 * For administrators accessing this endpoint, the operation returns appeals
 * across all users without member-based filtering, serving as the primary
 * interface for the administrative appeal review queue. Administrators use this
 * endpoint to identify pending appeals requiring review, track appeals
 * currently under review by specific administrators, analyze appeal patterns
 * and outcomes across the platform, and ensure timely processing of appeals
 * within the target review timelines specified in moderation system
 * requirements (7 days for warning appeals, 3 days for suspension appeals, 14
 * days for ban appeals).
 *
 * The response includes complete appeal information for each result: the appeal
 * explanation provided by the member (100-1000 characters), any additional
 * evidence or context submitted, the current appeal status, the assigned
 * reviewing administrator (if applicable), the administrator's decision
 * (uphold, reverse, or modify), detailed decision reasoning, descriptions of
 * any corrective actions taken for approved appeals (warning removal,
 * suspension lift, account restoration), and complete timestamp tracking from
 * submission through review to resolution.
 *
 * Each appeal result includes references to the underlying moderation action
 * being contested, allowing administrators to view the complete context
 * including the original violation, moderator reasoning, content snapshots, and
 * the full moderation history that led to the appeal. This comprehensive
 * context supports informed appeal decisions and maintains transparency
 * throughout the appeals process.
 *
 * The operation supports pagination for efficient handling of large appeal
 * volumes across the entire platform, with configurable page sizes and
 * navigation through multi-page result sets. Sorting options enable
 * administrators to prioritize appeals by urgency (oldest pending first),
 * recency (newest submissions first), assigned reviewer, or resolution status
 * to organize their administrative workflow effectively.
 *
 * This search operation integrates with the appeal submission workflow, the
 * moderation action system, and the notification system to provide
 * administrators with complete appeal management capabilities. When
 * administrators review appeals and make decisions, they can access complete
 * moderation context, user history, and relevant content to make fair, informed
 * determinations. When appeals are approved and decisions are reversed, the
 * system automatically triggers corrective actions and sends notifications to
 * affected users.
 *
 * Security and privacy considerations include validation that the requesting
 * user has administrator role with proper permissions to review all appeals,
 * comprehensive audit logging of all administrative appeal searches and reviews
 * for accountability and compliance reporting as specified in the moderation
 * audit requirements, and appropriate handling of sensitive moderation
 * information in responses.
