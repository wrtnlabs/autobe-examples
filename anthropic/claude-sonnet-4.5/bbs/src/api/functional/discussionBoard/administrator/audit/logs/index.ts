/**
 * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated audit log entries for system activity
 * tracking.
 *
 * This operation provides administrators with comprehensive access to the
 * platform's audit trail, retrieving filtered and paginated records from the
 * discussion_board_audit_logs table. The audit log captures all significant
 * user and system actions across the platform including topic creation, reply
 * posting, content editing and deletion, voting activity, user profile
 * modifications, and administrative configuration changes. This operation is
 * essential for compliance auditing, security incident investigation, user
 * activity analysis, and platform governance.
 *
 * The operation supports extensive filtering capabilities to help
 * administrators locate specific audit events efficiently. Filters include
 * user_id to track specific user activities, action_type to find particular
 * operation categories (topic_created, reply_posted, vote_cast,
 * profile_updated, content_deleted), entity_type and entity_id to investigate
 * actions on specific platform entities, date range filtering for time-bound
 * investigations, and IP address filtering for security analysis and fraud
 * detection.
 *
 * Security considerations mandate that only users with the administrator role
 * can access audit logs, as these records contain comprehensive platform
 * activity data including deleted content snapshots, user behavioral patterns,
 * and sensitive security information. The operation implements strict
 * role-based access control and validates administrator authentication before
 * returning any audit data.
 *
 * The response includes detailed audit log entries with action descriptions,
 * entity information, metadata JSON blobs containing before/after values and
 * affected fields, IP addresses and user agents for security tracking, and
 * precise timestamps for activity timeline reconstruction. Results are
 * paginated to handle the large volume of audit data efficiently, with default
 * page sizes optimized for administrative review workflows.
 *
 * This operation integrates with the security monitoring system by providing
 * the data foundation for detecting suspicious patterns, investigating security
 * incidents, tracking moderation actions, and generating compliance reports.
 * Administrators use this audit trail to verify platform integrity, investigate
 * user complaints, analyze moderator performance, and ensure consistent policy
 * enforcement.
 *
 * Related operations include security log retrieval (PATCH /security/logs) for
 * authentication-specific events, moderation audit log access (PATCH
 * /moderation/audit-logs) for moderation-specific actions, and search history
 * analysis (PATCH /search/history) for understanding user information needs.
 * The general audit log provides the broadest activity view across all platform
 * operations.
