/**
 * Search and retrieve filtered, paginated replies for a discussion topic.
 *
 * This operation retrieves a comprehensive list of replies for a specific
 * discussion topic from the discussion_board_replies table, with advanced
 * filtering, searching, sorting, and pagination capabilities. The operation is
 * designed to support complex queries that help users navigate threaded
 * conversations, find specific responses, and discover high-quality
 * contributions within a discussion.
 *
 * The Prisma schema shows that discussion_board_replies supports threaded
 * conversations through the parent_reply_id self-referential relationship, with
 * depth_level tracking to enforce the maximum threading depth of 10 levels
 * specified in the business rules. Each reply belongs to exactly one
 * discussion_board_topics record (via discussion_board_topic_id) and is
 * authored by a discussion_board_members record (via
 * discussion_board_member_id). This operation leverages these relationships to
 * retrieve complete reply information including author details, threading
 * context, and engagement metrics.
 *
 * Authentication and authorization considerations vary by user role. Guests can
 * view all public replies without authentication, providing read-only access to
 * facilitate content discovery and encourage registration. Members, moderators,
 * and administrators have the same read access but may see additional
 * information based on their permissions. The operation respects content
 * visibility rules, hiding replies marked as deleted (deleted_at timestamp set)
 * from regular users while potentially showing them to moderators and
 * administrators for audit purposes. Suspended or banned users' replies remain
 * visible but may be flagged with moderation indicators.
 *
 * The filtering capabilities support multiple dimensions. Users can filter by
 * author to find all replies from specific contributors within the discussion.
 * Date range filtering allows finding replies posted within specific
 * timeframes, useful for tracking conversation evolution or finding recent
 * updates. Vote score filtering surfaces highly-rated replies by applying
 * minimum vote thresholds, helping users identify valuable contributions.
 * Content search performs full-text search across reply content using the
 * trigram index on the content column, enabling users to find specific
 * arguments, data points, or references within long discussions. Depth level
 * filtering allows users to focus on top-level replies or explore deeply nested
 * conversations.
 *
 * The sorting options reflect different user needs. Chronological sorting
 * (oldest first) is the default and preserves natural conversation flow, making
 * it easy to follow discussions as they developed. Newest first sorting helps
 * users catch up on the latest responses in active discussions. Highest voted
 * sorting surfaces the most valuable contributions as determined by community
 * voting. Threading depth sorting allows exploring conversation structure by
 * nesting level.
 *
 * Pagination is essential for handling topics with hundreds or thousands of
 * replies. The business rules specify displaying 50 replies per page when
 * viewing topics, with pagination controls for navigating between pages. The
 * response includes pagination metadata showing total reply count, current page
 * number, total pages, and whether additional pages exist. This allows clients
 * to implement pagination UI elements and load additional replies on demand.
 *
 * The response structure includes complete reply information for rendering
 * threaded discussions. Each reply contains the reply content (which may be
 * Markdown formatted), author information (username, display_name, reputation,
 * role), creation and update timestamps, depth level for visual indentation,
 * parent reply ID for threading context, vote counts and net score, edit
 * indicators showing if content was modified, and child reply counts for
 * expanding nested threads. This comprehensive data enables rich client-side
 * rendering of threaded discussions with proper visual hierarchy.
 *
 * Performance considerations include efficient database querying using the
 * indexed columns (discussion_board_topic_id, discussion_board_member_id,
 * parent_reply_id) and the trigram GIN index on content for full-text search.
 * The operation should return results within 2 seconds for typical queries per
 * the performance requirements, with caching strategies for frequently accessed
 * topic replies. Large result sets are paginated to prevent overwhelming
 * clients with excessive data in a single response.
 *
 * Integration with other systems includes the voting system to retrieve vote
 * counts and calculate net scores, the user reputation system to include author
 * reputation in reply data, the edit history tracking to show edit indicators
 * and timestamps, and the moderation system to respect content visibility rules
 * for deleted or hidden replies. The operation may also integrate with the
 * blocked users system to filter out replies from users the requesting user has
 * blocked.

 * active (non-deleted) replies, while moderators and administrators can access
 * soft-deleted replies for audit purposes. The operation enforces content
 * visibility rules ensuring users cannot access replies from topics they don't
 * have permission to view.
 *
 * The response provides complete author information including username, display
 * name, role badge (member, moderator, administrator), and reputation score,
 * enabling clients to render rich user attribution. Timestamps include creation

/**
 * Retrieve paginated edit history for a specific discussion reply.
 *
 * Retrieve the complete edit history for a specific reply within a discussion
 * topic, providing full transparency into how reply content has been modified
 * over time. This operation queries the discussion_board_edit_history table
 * filtering for entity_type='reply' and entity_id matching the specified
 * replyId parameter.
 *
 * Edit history for replies is crucial in threaded economic and political
 * discussions where nuanced arguments develop over multiple exchanges. Users
 * need to see how replies have evolved to understand the full context of
 * conversations, especially when replies are edited after other users have
 * responded to them. This prevents confusion and maintains the integrity of
 * discussion threads.
 *
 * The operation captures comprehensive edit information for each modification:
 * the complete content snapshot before the edit, the complete content snapshot
 * after the edit, the member who performed the edit (with their username and
 * role), the precise timestamp of the modification, and any optional
 * explanation the editor provided for why they made changes. This level of
 * detail ensures users can track exactly how arguments or statements evolved.
 *
 * Pagination support is essential since active replies in popular discussions
 * may accumulate numerous edits. The request body allows filtering by date
 * ranges (e.g., show only edits from the last week), sorting by edit timestamp
 * (newest or oldest first), and limiting results per page. This enables
 * efficient navigation through edit histories of various sizes.
 *
 * Security and access control considerations include verifying that both the
 * topic and reply exist, that they are accessible to the requesting user based
 * on visibility rules, and that the reply actually belongs to the specified
 * topic (preventing unauthorized access to reply edit histories through topic
 * ID manipulation). While edit histories are generally public for transparency
 * in discussions, deleted or moderated content may have restricted edit history
 * access limited to moderators, administrators, and the original author.
 *
 * The operation integrates with the broader discussion management system by
 * respecting content visibility rules, moderation status, and soft deletion
 * states. If a reply has been deleted but is within the 30-day recovery window,
 * its edit history remains accessible to authorized users (content author,
 * moderators, administrators) for audit and potential restoration purposes.
 *
 * Related operations include GET /topics/{topicId}/replies/{replyId} to view
 * the current reply state, and PATCH /topics/{topicId}/replies to search
 * replies within a topic. The edit history provides the temporal dimension that
 * complements the current content view, enabling users to understand not just
 * what a reply says now, but how it evolved to its current state.
