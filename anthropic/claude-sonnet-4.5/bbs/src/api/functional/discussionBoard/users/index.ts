/**
 * Retrieve privacy-filtered profile information for a specific discussion board
 * member.
 *
 * Retrieve comprehensive profile information for a single discussion board
 * member identified by their unique UUID. This operation accesses the
 * discussion_board_members table and returns privacy-controlled user profile
 * data including username, display name, bio, avatar URL, location, website,
 * account status, email verification status, profile and activity visibility
 * settings, and activity timestamps (last login, last activity). The response
 * also includes related reputation statistics and contribution counts when
 * available.
 *
 * **CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT**: The response DTO MUST explicitly exclude
 * the following sensitive fields from the discussion_board_members schema:
 * `email` (authentication credential and PII), `password_hash` (authentication
 * secret), and any other internal security fields. These fields must NEVER be
 * exposed through this public API endpoint regardless of privacy settings.
 *
 * The member user system represents registered, authenticated participants who
 * form the core user base of the discussion board. Members can create topics,
 * post replies, vote on content, customize profiles, and manage preferences.
 * This endpoint provides the data necessary to display user profile pages, show
 * author information on discussion posts, and support user discovery and
 * networking features.
 *
 * Privacy considerations are critical for this operation. The
 * discussion_board_members table includes profile_visibility and
 * activity_visibility fields that control what information is exposed. The
 * operation applies the following privacy rules based on the Prisma schema:
 *
 * - If profile_visibility is 'public', all non-sensitive profile information is
 *   returned to any requester including unauthenticated guests
 * - If profile_visibility is 'members_only', profile information is returned only
 *   to authenticated members, moderators, and administrators
 * - If profile_visibility is 'private', only the profile owner (matching userId
 *   to authenticated user) can view full profile details; others see minimal
 *   public information (username and role badge only)
 * - Email addresses are NEVER returned in the response regardless of privacy
 *   settings, as they are sensitive authentication credentials
 * - Password hashes are NEVER returned under any circumstances
 * - Activity statistics respect the activity_visibility field independently from
 *   profile visibility
 *
 * The operation validates that the userId parameter is a valid UUID format and
 * that the member exists in the database. If the member is not found, has been
 * soft-deleted (deleted_at is not null), or the requesting user lacks
 * permission due to privacy settings, the API returns an appropriate error
 * response.
 *
 * This endpoint integrates with the authentication system to determine the
 * requesting user's role and identity for privacy enforcement. Unauthenticated
 * requests (guests) receive only publicly visible data. Authenticated members
 * see data according to privacy settings. Moderators and administrators may
 * have elevated visibility for moderation and user management purposes, though
 * email addresses and password hashes remain strictly protected.
 *
 * The response includes account_status field from the schema which indicates
 * whether the account is active, pending_verification, suspended, banned, or
 * deactivated. This field helps explain why certain users may not be creating
 * new content. The email_verified boolean indicates whether the user has
 * completed email verification, which affects their posting privileges.
 *
 * Activity timestamps (last_login_at and last_activity_at) provide engagement
 * indicators. The created_at field shows account age, which is often displayed
 * as 'Member since [date]' on profile pages. These temporal fields help users
 * assess contributor credibility and activity levels.

/**
 * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of discussion board members.
 *
 * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of discussion board members from the
 * system. This operation provides advanced search capabilities for finding
 * members based on multiple criteria including partial username matching,
 * display name searching, account status filtering, registration date ranges,
 * last activity timestamps, reputation score ranges, and email verification
 * status.
 *
 * The operation supports comprehensive pagination with configurable page sizes
 * and sorting options. Results can be sorted by registration date, last login
 * timestamp, last activity timestamp, username alphabetically, reputation
 * score, or other relevant member attributes in ascending or descending order.
 *
 * Security considerations include appropriate filtering of sensitive member
 * information based on the requesting user's authorization level. While this
 * endpoint is public to support member discovery features, sensitive fields are
 * strictly excluded from response payloads for privacy protection.
 *
 * CRITICAL PRIVACY PROTECTION: Email addresses, while supported as search
 * filter criteria (email verification status filtering), are NEVER included in
 * the response payload under any circumstances. The ISummary response type
 * explicitly excludes the email field, password_hash, and all other private
 * information to comply with privacy requirements and data protection
 * regulations. Only public profile fields (username, display_name, bio,
 * avatar_url, location, website, account_status, email_verified boolean flag,
 * reputation score, registration date, last activity date) are included in
 * search results. Full member details including email addresses are only
 * accessible through authenticated single-member retrieval endpoints with
 * appropriate ownership or administrative authorization.
 *
 * This operation integrates with the discussion_board_members table as defined
 * in the Prisma schema, incorporating all available member fields and
 * relationships including reputation scores from the
 * discussion_board_user_reputation table and engagement statistics. The
 * response includes member summary information optimized for list displays with
 * essential fields for member identification and basic profile information
 * while strictly protecting private data.
 *
 * The search functionality supports the platform's community discovery
 * features, allowing users to find other members with shared interests in
 * economic and political topics, identify active contributors, explore the
 * community, and discover quality content creators. The public nature of this
 * endpoint encourages community exploration while maintaining strict privacy
 * boundaries.
 *
 * Rate limiting is enforced according to the platform's business rules to
 * prevent abuse of the search functionality. Guest users are limited to 20
 * searches per hour, while authenticated members have higher limits (100
 * searches per hour). Search queries are validated for length (1-200
 * characters) and sanitized to prevent injection attacks. Excessive search
 * activity triggers temporary restrictions.
 *
 * The operation returns paginated results with 25 members per page by default,
 * configurable through request parameters up to a maximum of 100 members per
 * page. Each member record in the response includes only public profile
 * information: username, display name (if set), bio excerpt, account creation
 * date, reputation score, account status, email verification status (boolean),
 * role indicators, avatar URL, location, and website for display purposes.
 * Private information including email addresses, password hashes, IP addresses,
 * and detailed activity logs are completely excluded from all response
 * payloads.
