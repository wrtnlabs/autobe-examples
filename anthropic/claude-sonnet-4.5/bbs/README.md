# AutoBE Generated Backend Server

![AutoBE Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a90d14be-fd50-4dc7-ae9d-ca66c2124f31)

A backend repository generated by [`@autobe`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe).

This backend program was automatically generated using [`@autobe`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe), the AI vibe coding agent for backend servers of below stack.

- TypeScript
- NestJS / Nestia
- Prisma
- Postgres

  realize --"validates" --> tsCompiler("TypeScript Compiler")
end
```

Also, this backend application was built following [`@autobe`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe)'s waterfall development model, where each specialized AI agent handles a specific phase of development. The process ensures 100% working code through continuous compiler feedback and validation at every stage.

Each agent receives input from previous phases and produces validated output that becomes the foundation for the next development stage. The **Facade Controller** orchestrates the entire process, while **Functional Agents** handle specialized tasks with built-in **Compiler Feedback** ensuring code quality and correctness.

Below table shows the mapping between waterfall phases, corresponding [`@autobe`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe) agents, and the actual deliverables you can find in this repository:

Waterfall Model | AutoBe Agent | Result

## Project Structure

This template project has categorized directories like below.

As you can see from the below, all of the Backend source files are placed into the [src](src/) directory. When you build the TypeScript source files, compiled files would be placed into the `lib` directory following the [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json) configuration. Otherwise you build client [SDK library](https://nestia.io/docs/sdk/) for npm publishing and their compiled files would be placed into the [`packages`](packages) directory.

  - [`packages/api/`](packages/api): SDK module built by `npm run build:api`
  - [`docs/`](docs/): Documentation directory
    - [`docs/analysis`](docs/analysis/): Requirement Analysis report
    - [`docs/ERD.md`](docs/ERD.md): Entity Relationship Diagram and detailed descriptions
  - [`prisma/schema`](prisma/schema): Prisma ORM schema files
  - [`src/`](src): Backend source directory
    - [`src/api/`](src/api/): Client SDK that would be published to the `@ORGANIZATION/PROJECT-api`
      - [`src/api/functional/`](src/api/functional/): API functions generated by the [`nestia`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia)
      - [`src/api/structures/`](src/api/structures/): DTO structures
    - [`src/controllers/`](src/controllers/): Controller classes of the Main Program
    - [`src/providers/`](src/providers/): Implementations of the API functions
  - [`test/`](test): Test Automation Program
    - [`test/features`](test/features): List of test functions
  - [`nestia.config.ts`](nestia.config.ts): Configuration file of [`nestia`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia)
  - [`package.json`](package.json): NPM configuration
  - [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json): TypeScript configuration for the main program

## NPM Run Commands

List of the run commands defined in the [package.json](package.json) are like below:

    - `build:sdk`: Build SDK into main program only
    - `build:swagger`: Build Swagger Documents
    - **`dev`**: Incremental build for development (test program)
  - Deploy
    - `package:api`: Build and deploy the SDK library to the NPM
    - `start`: Start the backend server
    - `start:dev`: Start the backend server with incremental build and reload
