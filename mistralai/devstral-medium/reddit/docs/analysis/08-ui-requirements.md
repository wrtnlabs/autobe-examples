# Reddit-like Community Platform Requirements Analysis

## Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive requirements analysis for building a Reddit-like community platform. The platform will allow users to create communities, post content, vote on posts, comment with nested replies, and manage user profiles with a karma system.

## Key Features

The platform will include the following core features:

1. **User Registration and Login** - Secure authentication system
2. **Community Management** - Create and manage subreddit-like communities
3. **Content Creation** - Post text, links, and images
4. **Voting System** - Upvote/downvote posts and comments
5. **Commenting System** - Nested comment replies
6. **User Karma System** - Reputation tracking
7. **Content Sorting** - Hot, new, top, controversial filters
8. **User Profiles** - Show user activity and contributions
9. **Content Moderation** - Reporting and management tools

## User Roles and Authentication

The platform will support the following user roles:

### Guest (Unauthenticated)
- View public content
- Register for an account
- Login to existing account

### Member (Authenticated)
- Create and manage posts
- Comment on posts
- Vote on content
- Manage profile
- Create and subscribe to communities

### Moderator
- Manage content in specific communities
- Remove inappropriate posts/comments
- Manage community settings

### Admin
- Full system access
- Manage all users and communities
- System configuration

## Functional Requirements

### User Registration and Login

**EARS Format Requirements:**
- WHEN a user submits registration, THE system SHALL validate email uniqueness
- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL verify credentials and create session

**Business Rules:**
- Posts can contain text (max 40,000 characters)
- Links must be validated URLs
- Images must meet size and format requirements

### Voting System

**EARS Format Requirements:**
- WHEN a member upvotes content, THE system SHALL increment vote count

- Negative karma may trigger moderation

### Content Sorting and Filtering

**EARS Format Requirements:**
- THE system SHALL support sorting by hot, new, top, controversial
- WHEN a user selects a sort option, THE system SHALL reorder content
- THE system SHALL provide time-based filters (hour, day, week, month, year, all-time)

**Business Rules:**
- "Hot" algorithm: (upvotes - downvotes) / (time since post)^gravity
- "Top" shows highest vote content for selected time period
- "Controversial" shows content with balanced up/down votes

### User Profiles

- THE system SHALL show user karma and activity statistics
- WHEN a user edits profile, THE system SHALL validate changes

**Business Rules:**
- Profiles show last 100 posts and comments
- Users can set profile visibility preferences
- Profile edits require re-authentication

### Content Moderation

**EARS Format Requirements:**
- WHEN content is reported, THE system SHALL flag for moderator review
- WHEN a moderator removes content, THE system SHALL hide from public view
- THE system SHALL track moderation actions for audit

**Business Rules:**
- Reported content requires 3 reports before auto-hiding
- Moderators can reinstate removed content
- Users can appeal moderation decisions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Page loads under 2 seconds
- API responses under 500ms
- Support 10,000 concurrent users

### Security
- HTTPS encryption for all traffic
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Database sharding for large datasets
- CDN for static content delivery

## User Scenarios and Use Cases

### New User Registration
