# Technical Requirements Analysis Report

## 1. System Architecture

### Overview
The e-commerce shopping mall platform will be designed as a scalable, secure, and high-performance system to support a wide range of features including user registration, product catalog management, order processing, and payment handling.

### Architecture Approach
- **Microservices Architecture**: The system will be built using a microservices approach to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Each core function (user management, product catalog, order processing, etc.) will be a separate service.
- **API Gateway**: A central API gateway will manage all incoming requests, providing a single entry point for clients and handling authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
- **Service Communication**: Services will communicate using RESTful APIs and asynchronous messaging (e.g., Kafka) for event-driven interactions.

### Key Components
- **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Product Service**: Manages product catalog, categories, and inventory.
- **Order Service**: Processes orders, manages shopping carts, and handles order tracking.
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with payment gateways and processes transactions.
- **Notification Service**: Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications for order updates.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides administrative tools for managing users, products, and orders.

- **Health Checks**: Implement health checks to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances.

### Auto-Scaling Policies
- **Thresholds**: Define auto-scaling thresholds based on CPU, memory, and request rates.
- **Cool-Down Periods**: Implement cool-down periods to prevent rapid scaling.

### Performance Monitoring
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement real-time performance monitoring.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerting for performance degradation.
