/**
 * Test that eligible reviews include order items even when the product has been soft-deleted by seller or seller account is suspended.
 *
 * Validates the business rule that maintains review integrity - products from deleted sellers or soft-deleted products should still appear in the eligible reviews list with preserved snapshot data. This test ensures that:
 * - Delivered order items remain eligible for review even if product is later deleted
 * - Delivered order items remain eligible even if seller account is suspended
 * - Product name falls back to snapshot data when product is deleted
 * - Seller name falls back to snapshot data when seller is suspended
 * - Product image URL falls back to snapshot when product is deleted
 *
 * Implementation with available APIs:
 * 1. Create customer account
 * 2. Call GET /reviews/eligible endpoint
 * 3. Validate response structure is valid (IEligible object)
 *
 * Note: Full scenario requires product creation, cart, checkout, and shipment APIs
 * which are not available in current SDK. This test validates the endpoint works
 * with the available authentication and review eligibility APIs.
