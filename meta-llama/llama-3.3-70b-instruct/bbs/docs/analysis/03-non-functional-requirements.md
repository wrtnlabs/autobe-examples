The discussion board system will have the following components: user registration and login, forum categories, threads, posts, comments, moderation, search, and filtering. The system will allow users to register and log in, and then create and manage their own posts and comments. The system will also have moderation capabilities, including the ability to edit or delete posts and comments that violate community guidelines. The search function will allow users to find specific posts or comments, and the filtering function will allow users to narrow down their search results by category or keyword. The system will be designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and use the discussion board.
