## Data Protection

THE system SHALL implement end-to-end encryption for all sensitive user data using approved encryption methods like AES-256.
WHEN a user submits personal information, THE system SHALL store it securely in encrypted form.

### Authentication Security

THE system SHALL use multi-factor authentication for all user logins, supporting at least two authentication factors (something you know, something you have, or something you are).
IF a login attempt fails multiple times (threshold: 5 attempts within 10 minutes), THEN THE system SHALL lock the account temporarily for 30 minutes.

### Payment Security

THE system SHALL comply with PCI-DSS standards for payment processing by:
1. Using secure tokenization methods for all payment information
2. Encrypting all payment data both in transit (using TLS 1.3) and at rest (using AES-256)
3. Implementing regular PCI-DSS compliance audits and penetration testing

### Compliance Requirements

THE system SHALL adhere to relevant data protection regulations such as:
1. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
