## Admin Dashboard Requirements

### Overview
The admin dashboard is a critical component of the e-commerce platform, providing administrators with comprehensive tools to manage orders, products, users, and monitor system health.

### Order Management
1. **Order List View**: Display all orders with key information (order ID, customer name, order date, total amount, status)
2. **Order Filtering**: Allow filtering by status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
3. **Order Details**: Provide detailed view including customer information, products ordered, quantities, and shipping details
4. **Order Status Updates**: Enable administrators to update order status
5. **Order Cancellation**: Allow administrators to cancel orders with reason

### Product Management
1. **Product List View**: Show all products with essential details (product ID, name, category, price, stock status)
2. **Product Search**: Implement search functionality for products
3. **Product Creation**: Enable administrators to create new products with all required details (name, description, category, price, SKU details)
4. **Product Editing**: Allow modification of existing product information
5. **Product Deletion**: Enable removal of products with appropriate warnings

### User Management
1. **User List View**: Display all registered users with key information (user ID, name, email, registration date, role)
2. **User Search**: Implement search functionality for users
3. **User Details**: Provide detailed view including user profile information and order history
4. **User Role Management**: Enable role changes (customer to seller, etc.)
5. **User Account Status**: Allow administrators to enable/disable user accounts

### System Monitoring
1. **Dashboard Overview**: Display key metrics (total orders, total revenue, new users, active sellers)
2. **Sales Analytics**: Provide insights into sales trends and revenue
3. **User Analytics**: Show user registration trends and activity
4. **System Health**: Monitor and display system status and potential issues
5. **Log Viewing**: Allow access to system logs for troubleshooting

### Security Considerations
1. **Role-Based Access**: Ensure all admin features are restricted to authorized admin users
2. **Audit Logging**: Log all significant admin actions for traceability
3. **Secure Data Handling**: Ensure sensitive user information is handled securely

### Performance Requirements
1. **Response Times**: All admin dashboard pages should load within 2 seconds
2. **Data Updates**: Ensure real-time updates for critical information like order status
3. **Scalability**: Design to handle increasing number of orders, products, and users

### EARS Format Requirements
1. WHEN an administrator logs into the dashboard, THE system SHALL display the dashboard overview.
2. THE system SHALL update order status in real-time.
3. IF an administrator attempts to delete a product, THEN THE system SHALL prompt for confirmation.
4. WHERE a user is disabled, THE system SHALL prevent login.
