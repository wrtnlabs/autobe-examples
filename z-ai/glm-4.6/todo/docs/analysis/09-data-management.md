# Todo Application Data Management Requirements Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction and Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope
This document defines the comprehensive data management requirements for the Todo list application, focusing on minimum functionality while ensuring robust data handling practices. The data management framework encompasses the entire lifecycle of task data from creation through deletion, including retention policies, backup strategies, migration procedures, and quality standards.

### 1.2 Data Management Objectives
The primary objectives of the data management system are to ensure:

- **Data Compliance**: Adhere to privacy regulations and data protection standards
- **Operational Efficiency**: Optimize data operations for performance and scalability

### 1.3 Key Data Entities
The Todo application manages the following primary data entities:
- **Task Records**: Core task information including title, description, status, creation date, and modification history
- **User Data**: User account information and preferences (managed separately but referenced)
- **System Metadata**: Audit logs, timestamps, and system-generated identifiers

## 2. Data Lifecycle Management

### 2.1 Task Data Creation and Storage
WHEN a user creates a new task, THE system SHALL:
- Generate a unique identifier for each task record
