THE system SHALL provide users with the ability to manually log out and terminate their active sessions from all devices.

## 4. Privacy Requirements

### 4.1 User Privacy Protection
THE system SHALL respect user privacy and only access or use personal data when necessary for providing the todo list service.

THE system SHALL not share user personal data or todo content with third parties without explicit user consent, except as required by law.

WHEN users interact with the todo list application, THE system SHALL minimize data collection to only what is necessary for core functionality.

### 4.2 Data Collection Limitations
THE system SHALL collect only minimal personal information required for user account creation and service delivery.

THE system SHALL not collect unnecessary user data such as location information, contacts, or other personal details unrelated to todo list functionality.

THE system SHALL provide transparency about what data is collected and how it is used through clear privacy policies.

### 4.3 User Consent Requirements
THE system SHALL obtain explicit user consent before collecting, storing, or processing any personal information.

WHEN users register for the service, THE system SHALL present clear terms of service and privacy policies for user review and acceptance.

THE system SHALL provide users with the ability to review, modify, or delete their personal data and account information at any time.

## 5. Compliance Considerations

### 5.1 Data Protection Regulations
THE system SHALL comply with applicable data protection regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant privacy laws.

WHEN handling user data from different jurisdictions, THE system SHALL ensure compliance with local data protection requirements.

THE system SHALL maintain records of data processing activities and user consent as required by privacy regulations.

### 5.2 Security Standards Compliance
THE system SHALL follow industry security standards and best practices for web application security.

THE system SHALL implement appropriate security controls to protect against common web application vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.

THE system SHALL undergo regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

### 5.3 Audit and Logging Requirements
THE system SHALL maintain comprehensive security logs to monitor for suspicious activities and support incident response.

WHEN security events occur, THE system SHALL log relevant details including timestamps, user identifiers, and nature of the event.

THE system SHALL implement audit trails for sensitive operations such as user authentication, data modifications, and administrative actions.

### 5.4 Incident Response Requirements
THE system SHALL establish procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

WHEN a security breach is suspected, THE system SHALL implement immediate containment measures and notify affected users as required.

THE system SHALL maintain incident response capabilities to minimize impact of security events and prevent recurrence.

## 6. Access Control and Authorization

### 6.1 User Access Control
THE system SHALL implement role-based access control to ensure users can only access functions and data appropriate to their permissions.

WHEN users attempt to access protected resources, THE system SHALL validate their authentication status and authorization level before granting access.

THE system SHALL prevent privilege escalation attacks by strictly enforcing permission boundaries for all user operations.

### 6.2 Data Access Restrictions
THE system SHALL enforce strict data ownership rules where users can only access their own todo items and account information.

WHEN users perform any data operation, THE system SHALL validate that the operation is permitted based on the user's relationship to the target data.

THE system SHALL implement data isolation mechanisms to prevent cross-user data leakage or unauthorized access.

### 6.3 Administrative Access Controls
WHERE administrative functions exist, THE system SHALL implement additional security controls including multi-factor authentication and enhanced logging.

WHEN administrative operations are performed, THE system SHALL require elevated privileges and maintain detailed audit records of all administrative actions.
