## Use Cases and Scenarios

### Primary Use Case: Daily Task Management
**Scenario**: A user starts their day by reviewing existing tasks and adding new responsibilities

**User Flow**:
1. User opens the application to view current task list
2. User reviews existing tasks and their completion status
3. User adds 3-5 new tasks for the day
4. User marks one completed task as done
5. User edits one existing task to add more detail
6. User deletes one task that is no longer relevant
7. User continues with their day, confident that tasks are tracked

### Secondary Use Case: Quick Task Capture
**Scenario**: A user needs to quickly capture a task while working on something else

**User Flow**:
1. User opens the application rapidly
2. User immediately types in the new task
3. User saves the task in under 10 seconds
4. User returns to their previous activity
5. User knows the task is safely stored for later attention

### Edge Case: Large Task List Management
**Scenario**: A user has accumulated many tasks over time

**User Flow**:
1. User views their complete task list
2. User identifies tasks that can be marked as complete
3. User updates multiple task statuses efficiently
4. User deletes old, irrelevant tasks to clean up the list
5. User organizes remaining tasks for better visibility

### Error Scenario: Failed Operation
**Scenario**: A system error occurs during task management

**User Flow**:
1. User attempts to perform a task operation
2. System encounters an error and cannot complete the operation
3. System displays a clear, user-friendly error message
4. System provides guidance on how to proceed
5. User can retry the operation or continue with other tasks

## User Authentication and Access Control

### Authentication Requirements
WHEN a user wants to access their personal task list, THE system SHALL require user authentication to ensure data privacy and security.

THE system SHALL provide a simple registration process for new users that requires minimal information to create an account.

WHEN users register for an account, THE system SHALL validate that provided credentials meet minimum security requirements.

THE system SHALL provide a login process that allows existing users to access their tasks securely.

WHILE users are logged in, THE system SHALL maintain their session to avoid requiring frequent re-authentication during normal usage.

### User Data Isolation
THE system SHALL ensure that each user can only access and manage their own tasks, maintaining strict data isolation between user accounts.

WHEN a user performs any task operation, THE system SHALL validate that the user owns the task being modified.

IF a user attempts to access another user's tasks, THE system SHALL deny access and display an appropriate error message.

THE system SHALL prevent any possibility of data leakage between different user accounts through proper access controls.

## Data Requirements

### Task Data Structure
Each task must contain:
- Unique identifier for system reference
