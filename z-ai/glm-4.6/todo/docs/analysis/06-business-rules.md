# Business Rules and Constraints for Todo List Application

## Introduction and Overview

This document defines the comprehensive business rules, validation constraints, and operational limitations that govern the Todo list application. These rules ensure data integrity, maintain system consistency, and provide clear boundaries for all task management operations. The business rules are designed to support the minimum functionality requirements while ensuring a reliable and predictable user experience.

## Task Management Rules

### Task Creation Rules

**WHEN** a user creates a new task, **THE** system **SHALL** validate that the task title contains at least one character and does not exceed 200 characters.

**WHEN** a user creates a new task, **THE** system **SHALL** automatically set the task status to "incomplete" by default.

**WHEN** a user creates a new task, **THE** system **SHALL** assign a unique identifier to each task that cannot be duplicated within the system.

**WHEN** a user creates a new task, **THE** system **SHALL** record the creation timestamp automatically.

**IF** a user attempts to create a task without providing a title, **THEN** the system **SHALL** reject the creation and display a message indicating that a task title is required.

**IF** a user attempts to create a task with a title containing only whitespace characters, **THEN** the system **SHALL** reject the creation and display a message indicating that a valid task title is required.

### Task Modification Rules

**WHEN** a user edits an existing task, **THE** system **SHALL** validate that the task exists and belongs to the user making the modification request.

**WHEN** a user modifies a task title, **THE** system **SHALL** validate that the new title contains at least one character and does not exceed 200 characters.

**WHEN** a user modifies a task, **THE** system **SHALL** automatically update the last modified timestamp.

**IF** a user attempts to modify a task that does not exist, **THEN** the system **SHALL** display an error message indicating that the task was not found.

**IF** a user attempts to modify a task that belongs to another user, **THEN** the system **SHALL** deny access and display an unauthorized access message.

### Task Deletion Rules

**WHEN** a user deletes a task, **THE** system **SHALL** verify that the task exists and belongs to the user making the deletion request.

**WHEN** a user deletes a task, **THE** system **SHALL** permanently remove the task from the user's task list.

**IF** a user attempts to delete a task that does not exist, **THEN** the system **SHALL** display an error message indicating that the task was not found.

**IF** a user attempts to delete a task that belongs to another user, **THEN** the system **SHALL** deny access and display an unauthorized access message.

### Task Status Management Rules

**WHEN** a user marks a task as complete, **THE** system **SHALL** update the task status to "complete" and record the completion timestamp.

**WHEN** a user marks a complete task as incomplete, **THE** system **SHALL** update the task status to "incomplete" and clear the completion timestamp.

**WHEN** a user toggles task status, **THE** system **SHALL** immediately reflect the status change in the user's task list.

**IF** a user attempts to change the status of a task that does not exist, **THEN** the system **SHALL** display an error message indicating that the task was not found.

**IF** a user attempts to change the status of a task that belongs to another user, **THEN** the system **SHALL** deny access and display an unauthorized access message.

## Data Integrity Constraints

### Task Data Validation

**THE** system **SHALL** ensure that all task titles are stored as plain text without HTML or script tags to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**THE** system **SHALL** maintain the chronological order of task creation, ensuring that newer tasks can be identified by their creation timestamps.

**THE** system **SHALL** preserve the integrity of task ownership, ensuring that tasks cannot be transferred between users without explicit authorization.

**THE** system **SHALL** validate that all timestamps are recorded in a consistent format and timezone.

### User Data Constraints

**THE** system **SHALL** ensure that each user can only access and manage their own tasks.

**THE** system **SHALL** maintain user session integrity, ensuring that task operations are performed within authenticated user sessions.

**THE** system **SHALL** validate that user identifiers are consistent across all task operations to prevent data mixing between users.

### System Data Consistency

**THE** system **SHALL** maintain referential integrity between users and their tasks, ensuring that no task exists without a valid owner.

**THE** system **SHALL** ensure that task status transitions follow valid state patterns (incomplete â†” complete only).

**THE** system **SHALL** maintain data consistency across all task operations, preventing partial updates or corrupted data states.

## Business Logic Validation

### Input Validation Rules

**WHEN** processing task title input, **THE** system **SHALL** trim leading and trailing whitespace before validation.

**WHEN** processing task title input, **THE** system **SHALL** reject titles that contain only special characters without alphanumeric content.

**WHEN** processing any task operation, **THE** system **SHALL** validate that all required parameters are present and properly formatted.

**IF** input data contains unexpected fields or parameters, **THE** system **SHALL** ignore the unexpected fields and process only the valid parameters.

### Processing Logic Constraints

**THE** system **SHALL** process task operations in the order they are received to maintain consistency.

**THE** system **SHALL** ensure that task operations are atomic, meaning each operation either completes successfully or fails completely without partial effects.

**THE** system **SHALL** validate business rules before executing any task modification to prevent invalid states.

**WHILE** processing multiple task operations, **THE** system **SHALL** maintain data consistency and prevent race conditions.

### Output Format Requirements

**THE** system **SHALL** return consistent data formats for all task-related operations to ensure predictable client-side processing.

**THE** system **SHALL** include relevant metadata (timestamps, status, identifiers) in all task data responses.

**THE** system **SHALL** provide clear error messages that help users understand what went wrong and how to fix the issue.

## Operational Constraints

### User Operation Limits

**THE** system **SHALL** not impose artificial limits on the number of tasks a user can create.

**THE** system **SHALL** not restrict the frequency of task operations within reasonable usage patterns.

**THE** system **SHALL** allow users to perform any combination of task operations without requiring confirmation for standard operations.

**WHERE** a user performs rapid successive operations on the same task, **THE** system **SHALL** process each operation individually to maintain data integrity.

### System Usage Constraints

**THE** system **SHALL** require users to be authenticated before performing any task operations.

**THE** system **SHALL** maintain user sessions for a reasonable duration to allow normal task management activities.

**THE** system **SHALL** limit concurrent operations per user to prevent system overload while supporting normal usage patterns.

**WHILE** a user is authenticated, **THE** system **SHALL** allow continuous access to their tasks without unnecessary interruptions.

### Performance-Related Business Rules

**THE** system **SHALL** respond to task creation requests within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.

**THE** system **SHALL** retrieve and display task lists within 1 second for users with up to 1000 tasks.

**THE** system **SHALL** process task status changes instantly, providing immediate visual feedback to users.

**IF** system performance degrades beyond acceptable thresholds, **THE** system **SHALL** display appropriate messages to manage user expectations.

## System Limitations

### Functional Limitations

**THE** system **SHALL** not support task categorization or tagging as part of minimum functionality requirements.

**THE** system **SHALL** not support task dependencies or parent-child relationships between tasks.

**THE** system **SHALL** not support task sharing or collaboration features between users.

**THE** system **SHALL** not support advanced task features such as due dates, priorities, or reminders in the minimum functionality version.

### Data Volume Constraints

**THE** system **SHALL** handle task titles up to 200 characters in length.

**THE** system **SHALL** not impose limits on task description length as descriptions are not part of minimum functionality.

**THE** system **SHALL** efficiently handle task lists for individual users without performance degradation up to 10,000 tasks per user.

### Access Restrictions

**THE** system **SHALL** not allow anonymous users to create or manage tasks.

**THE** system **SHALL** not provide public access to any user's task list.

**THE** system **SHALL** not allow users to access system administration functions or other users' data.

**IF** a user attempts to access restricted functionality, **THE** system **SHALL** display appropriate access denied messages.

## Conclusion

These business rules and constraints provide the foundation for implementing a reliable, secure, and user-friendly Todo list application with minimum functionality. The rules ensure data integrity, maintain system consistency, and provide clear boundaries for all operations while keeping the implementation simple and focused on core task management needs.
