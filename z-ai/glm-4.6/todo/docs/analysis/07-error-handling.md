# Todo Application Error Handling and Recovery Requirements

## 1. Error Scenarios Classification

### 1.1 User Input Validation Errors

User input validation errors occur when users provide data that doesn't meet the required format, constraints, or business rules. These are the most common errors users will encounter and require clear, immediate feedback.

**Common Input Validation Errors:**
- Empty or missing required fields
- Invalid text formats (special characters, encoding issues)
- Text length violations (too short or too long)
- Invalid date formats or future dates for creation timestamps
- Duplicate task titles within the same user account

**Validation Error Severity Levels:**
- **Critical**: Required fields missing or completely invalid format
- **Warning**: Minor format issues that can be auto-corrected
- **Informational**: Suggestions for better input formatting

### 1.2 Task Operation Errors

Task operation errors occur during the execution of core Todo list functions. These errors affect the primary user workflows and require immediate attention to maintain user productivity.

**Task Creation Errors:**
- Maximum task limit reached for user account
- Concurrent creation conflicts
- Storage quota exceeded
- Invalid task state transitions

**Task Modification Errors:**
- Task not found or already deleted
- Concurrent modification conflicts
- Invalid status transitions
- Permission denied for task operations

**Task Deletion Errors:**
- Task already deleted by another process
- System lock preventing deletion
- Referential integrity constraints

### 1.3 Authentication and Authorization Errors

Authentication and authorization errors occur when users attempt to access the system or perform operations beyond their permissions. These errors are security-sensitive and must be handled carefully to avoid exposing system vulnerabilities.

**Authentication Errors:**
- Invalid credentials provided
- Account locked or suspended
- Session expired
- Invalid authentication tokens

**Authorization Errors:**
- Access denied to protected resources
- Insufficient permissions for operations
- Cross-user data access attempts

### 1.5 Data Integrity Errors

Data integrity errors occur when data consistency or validity is compromised. These errors are critical as they can lead to data loss or corruption if not properly handled.

**Data Consistency Errors:**
- Orphaned task records
- Incomplete task data
- Corrupted task metadata
- Synchronization conflicts between systems

**Data Validation Errors:**
- Invalid data relationships
- Constraint violations

- Avoid technical jargon and system codes in user-facing messages

### 2.2 Error Message Templates

**Input Validation Error Messages:**
- "Task title is required. Please enter a title for your task."
- "Task title must be between 1 and 100 characters."
- "Invalid characters detected. Please use only letters, numbers, and basic punctuation."
- "A task with this title already exists. Please choose a different title."

**Task Operation Error Messages:**
- "Task not found. It may have been deleted or doesn't exist."
- "Unable to save changes. Please try again in a moment."
- "This task cannot be deleted due to system restrictions."

**Authentication Error Messages:**
- "Invalid email or password. Please check your credentials and try again."
- "Your session has expired. Please log in again to continue."
