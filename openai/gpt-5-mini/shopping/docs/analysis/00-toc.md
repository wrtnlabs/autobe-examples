# Functional Requirements Specification â€” shoppingMall

## Document purpose and scope
This functional requirements specification defines business-level requirements for the shoppingMall e-commerce platform. It provides detailed, testable EARS-formatted requirements, workflows, and acceptance criteria for backend developers, QA, product managers, and operations. This document specifies WHAT the platform must do; it does not prescribe HOW to implement features (no database schema, API endpoints, or code).

Timezone: All time-related business expectations reference Asia/Seoul (KST). Durations are given in minutes, hours, or days to remain timezone-agnostic when applied.

Audience: Backend developers, product managers, QA engineers, operations, and security.

Minimum completeness target: 5,000+ characters focused on business logic and acceptance criteria.

## Executive summary
shoppingMall is a multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace enabling shoppers to discover products, select SKUs (variants such as color and size), persist carts and wishlists, place orders, and track shipments. Sellers manage product listings, SKUs, and per-SKU inventory. The platform supports order history, cancellations, refund requests, product reviews, and an admin dashboard for moderation and reporting.

Primary objectives:
- Prevent overselling through SKU-level inventory management and reservation rules.
- Provide reliable checkout with address management and payment processing that records clear payment states.
- Support sellers in listing products with multiple SKUs and managing inventory and fulfillment.
- Provide transparent order lifecycle and timely shipping/tracking updates.

Success metrics (examples; stakeholder to confirm numeric targets):
- Checkout success rate: >= 98% for valid payment attempts.
- Inventory consistency: <= 0.5% mismatch incidents per month.
- Order confirmation notification: delivered to buyer within 2 minutes of payment success for 95% of orders.

## User roles and responsibilities (business terms)
- guest: Browse catalog, use search, view products and sellers, add items to a temporary wishlist in-session. Cannot place orders or manage addresses.
- customer: Register, authenticate, manage multiple shipping addresses, manage persistent carts and wishlists, place orders and payments, track orders, request cancellations/refunds, and submit product reviews.
- seller: Register as merchant, create/manage product listings and SKUs, manage inventory per SKU, view orders containing their SKUs, update fulfillment/shipping status for their shipments, and respond to customer inquiries.
- supportAgent: Access orders for support workflows, process cancellations/refunds per policy, communicate with buyers and sellers, and escalate to admin when required.
- admin: Full platform oversight for user/seller management, product moderation, order escalations, policy configuration, and reporting.

## Authentication and Authorization (business requirements)
- WHEN a new user registers, THE shoppingMall SHALL capture email and password and SHALL send an email verification request; unverified accounts SHALL be prevented from placing orders until verification is completed (default verification window: 72 hours).
- WHEN a user authenticates successfully, THE shoppingMall SHALL create an authenticated session and SHALL allow optional persistent sessions via "remember me" with a configurable lifetime (default recommended: 30 days for refresh tokens, 15-30 minutes for access token sessions).
- IF an account experiences more than 10 failed login attempts within a 15-minute sliding window, THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL block further login attempts for 15 minutes and require password reset or admin intervention.
- WHEN a user initiates a password reset, THE shoppingMall SHALL send a single-use reset link expiring in 1 hour and SHALL invalidate existing sessions after a successful reset.

Permission matrix (business-level):
- guest: BrowseCatalog, SearchProducts, ViewProductDetails, TemporaryWishlist
- customer: All guest actions + ManageProfile, AddressManagement, PersistCart, PlaceOrder, ViewOwnOrders, WriteReview, RequestCancelRefund
- seller: All customer actions when acting as buyer + SellerProductManagement, InventoryManagement, ViewSellerOrders, UpdateShippingStatus
- supportAgent: ViewAllOrders, ProcessRefunds (limited by thresholds), UpdateOrderStatus, ModerateReviews
- admin: All permissions, including SuspendSeller, OverrideOrders, ConfigurePlatformRules

## Functional requirements (EARS where applicable)

```

### 11) Order history, cancellation, and refund requests
- WHEN a customer views order history, THE shoppingMall SHALL list all orders with state, line-item level details, seller attribution, and timestamps for key events.
- IF a customer requests cancellation before items are shipped and within the configured cancellation window, THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL accept the cancellation and SHALL initiate refund processing according to payment provider policies.

### 12) Admin dashboard and management operations
- THE shoppingMall SHALL provide admin actors with audit-enabled operations for viewing and filtering orders, viewing seller accounts, moderating reviews, and overriding order states as required for dispute resolution.
- WHEN an admin changes an order state or issues a refund, THE shoppingMall SHALL create an auditable entry including admin actor id, action, timestamp, and reason; audit logs SHALL be retained per platform retention policy.

Acceptance criteria:
- Admin actions SHALL be recorded and retrievable by audit queries within 2 seconds for the most recent 30 days of log entries.

## Business rules and validation constraints
- Inventory ownership: THE shoppingMall SHALL treat SKU inventory as the responsibility of the seller who listed the SKU. Sellers are responsible for accurate inventory data and replenishment.
- Reservation rules: WHEN a payment authorization occurs, THE shoppingMall SHALL reserve inventory immediately for a default 15-minute window and SHALL move reserved inventory to committed inventory on payment capture.
- Oversell prevention: IF the finalization step would cause availableInventory to become negative due to concurrent activity, THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL fail the conflicting checkout and SHALL notify the customer of the specific SKU(s) causing the failure with alternatives where possible.
- Refund eligibility: THE shoppingMall SHALL allow refund requests within 14 calendar days after delivery for standard goods by default; this window is configurable per category and per seller policy but SHALL not be shorter than platform minimum without stakeholder agreement.
- Review eligibility: THE shoppingMall SHALL allow reviews from verified purchasers only; non-purchaser reviews SHALL be rejected.

## Primary user stories and use cases
(Each story includes preconditions, flow, and success criteria â€” representative samples below.)

### Customer: Register and Checkout
- Preconditions: Customer has valid email and password and at least one payment method and shipping address saved.
- Flow: Register -> Verify Email -> Add Address -> Add SKU to Cart -> Checkout -> Payment Authorized -> Order Confirmed -> Receipt Sent
- Success criteria: Order created and payment authorized; order confirmation delivered to buyer within 2 minutes.

### Seller: Create Product with SKUs
- Preconditions: Seller account is active and verified for required categories.
- Flow: Create Product -> Define Variant Attributes -> Generate/Edit SKUs -> Set Inventory -> Publish
- Success criteria: Product searchable, SKUs visible with correct inventory and price.

## Conceptual data entities and relationships (business-level)
- User (userId, role, email, verifiedFlag, displayName)
- Address (addressId, userId, recipientName, street, city, postalCode, country, phone)
- SellerProfile (sellerId, displayName, status, payoutSettingsReference)
- Product (productId, sellerId, title, description, categoryId, images)
- SKU (skuId, productId, attributesMap, price, inventoryCount)
- Cart (cartId, userId or guestToken, lineItems[skuId, quantity])
- Wishlist (wishlistId, userId or guestToken, skuEntries)
- Order (orderId, buyerId, orderItems[skuId, quantity, unitPrice, sellerId], orderTotal, shippingAddressSnapshot, status, paymentState)
- Shipment (shipmentId, orderId, sellerId, carrier, trackingNumber, status)
- Review (reviewId, skuId, buyerId, rating, text, moderatedFlag)
- RefundRequest (refundRequestId, orderId, requesterId, reason, status)

Relationships (business view):
- User may have many Addresses, Carts, Wishlists, Orders, and Reviews
- SellerProfile owns Products; Product contains multiple SKUs; SKU belongs to one Product
- Order contains one or more OrderItems referencing SKUs; each OrderItem is attributable to a Seller
- Shipment is associated with an Order (or subset of OrderItems) and a Seller

## Non-functional requirements and priorities
- Performance: THE shoppingMall SHALL return search results within 2 seconds for the top 80% of queries and SHALL complete core checkout creation/reservation steps within 3 seconds for 99% of requests under normal load.
- Availability: THE shoppingMall SHALL target 99.5% availability for buyer-facing flows during business hours in primary region.
- Reliability: THE shoppingMall SHALL ensure a successful payment results in an order record 99.9% of the time and SHALL log failures for reconciliation.
- Security & Data Protection: THE shoppingMall SHALL enforce email verification and protect PII according to applicable law; payment card data storage SHALL be minimized, with tokenization recommended by implementation team.
- Scalability: THE shoppingMall SHALL be designed to scale horizontally for catalog and order workloads; initial load assumptions to be provided by stakeholders.

## Acceptance criteria and EARS-formatted requirements (representative)
- WHEN a guest adds an SKU to cart, THE shoppingMall SHALL reserve the requested quantity for 15 minutes and return a reservation identifier.
- IF the reserved time expires without payment, THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL release the reserved inventory back to available stock within 1 second of expiry.
- WHEN a customer completes payment successfully, THE shoppingMall SHALL convert reservations into permanent decrements and mark the order as "Paid" within 30 seconds of payment confirmation.
- WHEN a seller updates an SKU inventory count, THE shoppingMall SHALL record the change with actor and timestamp and SHALL reflect new availability to customers within 60 seconds.
- WHEN a customer requests cancellation before shipment, THE shoppingMall SHALL allow cancellation if within policy and SHALL notify seller(s) and supportAgent within 10 minutes.

## Open questions and decisions required
- Payment gateway selection and whether to support authorize-then-capture or immediate capture semantics at MVP.
- Shipping carrier integrations for real-time tracking vs manual tracking by sellers.
- Final refund windows and category-specific refund rules (default recommended: 14 days post-delivery for returns, 30 days for refunds on undelivered orders).
- Seller onboarding policy and KYC threshold for mandatory verification.
- SKU-per-product upper limit and address count per customer (defaults suggested: 500 SKUs per product, 10 addresses per customer).
- Promotion/Coupon behavior and stacking rules.

## Appendix: glossary and conventions
- SKU: Stock Keeping Unit â€” represents a specific variant of a product.
- Reservation: Temporary hold on inventory during checkout until payment capture or expiry.
- Order-line: The item-level record inside an order representing SKU, quantity, and seller attribution.

## Implementation boundary statement
This document contains business-level functional requirements only. Detailed technical implementation (APIs, schema, vendor libraries) is left to development teams.
