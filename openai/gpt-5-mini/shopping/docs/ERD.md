### `shopping_mall_carts`

Persistent shopping carts and guest carts. A cart may belong to either a
registered customer ([shopping_mall_customer.id](#shopping_mall_customer)) or a guest
session ([shopping_mall_guest.id](#shopping_mall_guest)). Used to persist items prior to
checkout and to support merge behavior when guests log in. Soft-delete
and timestamps maintained for auditing and lifecycle management. NOTE:
removed single-column unique constraint on shopping_mall_customer_id to
allow multiple saved carts per customer. If single active-cart semantics
are required, implement a partial unique index on
(shopping_mall_customer_id) WHERE status='active' at DB migration time.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `shopping_mall_customer_id`
  > Belonged customer's [shopping_mall_customer.id](#shopping_mall_customer). Nullable to
  > support guest carts.
- `shopping_mall_guest_id`
  > Belonged guest session [shopping_mall_guest.id](#shopping_mall_guest). Nullable to
  > support persistent customer carts.
- `guest_token`: Optional guest token for client-side mapping of temporary guest carts.
- `reservation_token`
  > Optional reservation identifier used during checkout to correlate
  > reserved inventory or payment attempts. INDEX recommended for lookup

metadata to support the checkout reservation lifecycle. Added composite
unique constraint on (shopping_mall_cart_id, shopping_mall_sku_id) to
prevent duplicate lines and simplify upsert logic.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `shopping_mall_cart_id`: Parent cart reference. [shopping_mall_carts.id](#shopping_mall_carts)
- `shopping_mall_sku_id`: Referenced SKU for this line item. [shopping_mall_skus.id](#shopping_mall_skus)

  > on inventory exists.
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp.
- `deleted_at`: Soft-delete timestamp for item removal history.

### `shopping_mall_wishlists`

User wishlists for saving SKUs for later. Wishlists may belong to a
registered customer ([shopping_mall_customer.id](#shopping_mall_customer)) or a guest
session ([shopping_mall_guest.id](#shopping_mall_guest)). Supports named lists and
soft-delete for lifecycle management. Recommendation: default is_public
to false at DB or application layer to avoid accidental public lists for
guests.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `shopping_mall_customer_id`
  > Owning customer reference. [shopping_mall_customer.id](#shopping_mall_customer). Nullable to
  > support guest wishlists.
- `shopping_mall_guest_id`
  > Owning guest session reference. [shopping_mall_guest.id](#shopping_mall_guest). Nullable
  > to support persistent customer lists.
- `name`
  > Optional user-visible name for the wishlist (for example 'Birthday
  > ideas').
- `is_public`
  > Whether the wishlist is visible to others. Recommended default: false.
  > Application must enforce visibility semantics for guest vs. authenticated
  > lists.
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp.
- `deleted_at`: Soft-delete timestamp.

### `shopping_mall_wishlist_items`

Items saved in a wishlist. Each record links a wishlist to a SKU ({@link
shopping_mall_skus.id}). Duplicate (wishlist, sku) pairs are prevented by
a unique index to avoid redundant entries.

### `shopping_mall_orders`

Order header capturing a single buyer-facing order. Stores buyer
reference, shipping address snapshot, pricing breakdown, and lifecycle
timestamps. Modified to avoid cascading delete cycles with shipments:
primary shipment is represented via shipment records rather than a direct
foreign key on the order to prevent circular cascade delete issues.

shopping_mall_payments}, [shopping_mall_refund_requests](#shopping_mall_refund_requests), {@link
shopping_mall_shipments}.
