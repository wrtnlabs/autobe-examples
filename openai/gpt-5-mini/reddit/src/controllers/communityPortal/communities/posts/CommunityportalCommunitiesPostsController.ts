  /**
   * List posts in a community with pagination, filtering and sorting
   * (community_portal_posts).
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered, sorted, and paginated list of posts within a single
   * community. This operation queries the community_portal_posts table (Prisma
   * model community_portal_posts) for records whose community_id matches the
   * provided communityId, excluding records where deleted_at is set. It returns
   * a page container of post summary items suitable for list displays.
   *
   * Security considerations and permissions:
   *
   * Public access is allowed for posts in communities whose visibility is
   * 'public'. For communities with private visibility, the service MUST require
   * authentication and verify the requesting user is permitted to view that
   * community (membership or explicit access). The implementation MUST not
   * expose content for private communities to unauthenticated callers; when
   * access is denied the service returns 403 Forbidden.
   *
   * Relationship to database entities:
   *
   * This operation is directly associated with the community_portal_posts
   * Prisma model. Returned summaries should include core properties (id, title,
   * post_type, created_at, status, author_user_id, image_url/link_url where
   * applicable) and must not expose sensitive fields such as internal
   * moderation metadata beyond the documented response schema.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - CommunityId path parameter MUST be a UUID identifying the target community.
   *   The service MUST verify the community exists.
   * - Deleted posts (deleted_at IS NOT NULL) MUST be excluded from results.
   * - Results MUST support pagination (limit, offset or page/size) and return
   *   total counts in the paginated response metadata.
   * - Sorting accepts sort values 'hot', 'new', 'top', 'controversial'. The exact
   *   ranking algorithms for 'hot' and 'controversial' are stakeholder-defined
   *   and are not implemented here; the API accepts the parameter and returns
   *   posts ordered accordingly by the backend implementation.
   *
   * Related operations:
   *
   * - Creating or updating posts is handled by POST/PUT endpoints on
   *   /communityPortal/communities/{communityId}/posts (not part of this
   *   operation).
   * - To view comments for a specific post use GET/PATCH on
   *   /communityPortal/posts/{postId}/comments.
   *
   * Error handling and edge cases:
   *
   * - If the communityId does not exist, the service SHALL return 404 Not Found.
   * - If the community is private and the caller is unauthenticated or
   *   unauthorized, the service SHALL return 403 Forbidden.
   * - If pagination parameters are invalid (e.g., limit too large), the service
   *   SHALL return 400 Bad Request with an explanatory message.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param communityId UUID of the target community
   *   (community_portal_communities.id)
   * @param body Search, filter and pagination parameters for community posts
