   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of community posts.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of community posts from the system.
   *
   * This operation provides advanced search and filtering for the Prisma model
   * `community_portal_posts` (the schema describes this as the "Primary entity
   * for community posts" and documents fields such as `post_type`, `title`,
   * `body`, `link_url`, `image_url`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and
   * `deleted_at`). The endpoint accepts complex request criteria (filter by
   * community, author, type, and status; full-text search across `title` and
   * `body`; time-range filters) and returns a paginated collection of summary
   * objects optimized for feed displays.
   *
   * Security and visibility considerations: By default, results exclude rows
   * with a non-null `deleted_at` (the model includes a `deleted_at` column).
   * The response also respects community visibility: posts belonging to
   * communities whose `visibility` is not public must not be returned to
   * unauthenticated guests; authenticated callers may receive additional posts
   * according to their access rights. Sorting modes include `hot`, `new`,
   * `top`, and `controversial` — note that the Prisma model stores the
   * canonical fields used for ranking (timestamps and status) but does not
   * prescribe ranking formulas; the hot/controversial algorithms are to be
   * defined by implementers.
   *
   * Relationship notes: Each returned post summary will normally include the
   * post's `id`, `community_id`, `author_user_id`, `post_type`, `title`,
   * `status`, and `created_at` and may include derived fields such as `score`
   * or `preview` produced by aggregation or materialized views. The operation
   * should not attempt to mutate system-generated aggregates directly; any
   * ranking/score values should be read from authoritative aggregates or
   * computed via the agreed algorithm.
   *
   * Validation and error handling: The request body is validated against
   * allowed filter keys and pagination ranges. Invalid UUIDs or unsupported
   * enum values result in a 400 Bad Request. If an internal error occurs,
   * respond with 500. For large result sets, the operation supports `limit` and
   * `offset` and SHOULD encourage use of cursor-based pagination for very large
   * feeds.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria and pagination parameters for post filtering
   *   (filters: communityId, authorUserId, postType, status, q, createdAt
   *   range; sorting: sort=hot|new|top|controversial; pagination: limit,
   *   offset).

  /**
   * Retrieve a single community post by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve detailed information for a single community post by its ID.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation returns the canonical post record from
   * the Prisma model `community_portal_posts` (the schema describes it as the
   * primary entity for community posts). It includes all detail fields suitable
   * for a post detail page: `title`, `body` (for text posts), `link_url` (for
   * link posts), `image_url` (for image posts), `post_type`, `status`,
   * timestamps, and relational references to author and community.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Because `community_portal_posts` records have a
   * `deleted_at` field, this endpoint by default hides soft-deleted posts and
   * returns 404 for such records. Additionally, community visibility rules
   * (stored on `community_portal_communities.visibility` and `is_private`) must
   * be enforced: posts in non-public communities are returned only to
   * authorized callers. If the post's `author_user_id` is null (user deleted),
   * the endpoint SHOULD surface a safe placeholder for author information.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying DB entities: The operation maps directly to the
   * `community_portal_posts` Prisma model and must not reference non-existent
   * columns. The Prisma schema documents how posts relate to comments, votes
   * and reports; the endpoint SHOULD not attempt to return exhaustive comment
   * or vote lists inline unless the client requests them via explicit query
   * parameters (e.g., includeComments=true) — keep the default payload focused
   * on the post record and essential relational summaries.
   *
   * Validation rules and error handling: Validate `postId` as UUID. Return 400
   * on malformed IDs, 404 if post not found or soft-deleted (unless
   * privileged), and 403 if access is denied due to community privacy.
   * Unexpected server errors result in 500.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier (UUID) of the target post
