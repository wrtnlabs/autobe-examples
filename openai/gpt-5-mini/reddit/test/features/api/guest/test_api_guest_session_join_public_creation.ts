/**
 * Validate public guest session creation (POST /auth/guest/join).
 *
 * Business purpose:
 *
 * - Allow unauthenticated visitors to obtain a short-lived guest credential
 *   (guest_token) recorded in community_portal_guests. This enables read-only
 *   or scoped interactions without full account registration.
 *
 * Test steps:
 *
 * 1. Call POST /auth/guest/join with an empty create body.
 * 2. Assert response type ICommunityPortalGuest.IAuthorized via typia.assert().
 * 3. Verify guest_token and token.access are present and non-empty.
 * 4. Verify created_at is recent (within tolerance) and expired_at (if present) is
 *    in the future.
 * 5. Ensure sensitive fields (e.g., password_hash) are not leaked in the response
 *    object.
