   * Register a new TodoApp user (creates a row in todo_app_user).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This endpoint registers a new user and persists a new
   * record in the `todo_app_user` table. It uses the table's `email` field as
   * the primary unique identifier for account creation and will cause a new
   * `todo_app_user` row to be created with server-calculated `password_hash`,
   * `created_at`, and `updated_at` values.
   *
   * Implementation details and required fields: The request must supply an
   * `email` and a plaintext password (or equivalent credential material). The
   * server implementation will compute and store `password_hash` in the
   * `todo_app_user.password_hash` column and will enforce the unique constraint
   * on `todo_app_user.email` (@@unique([email]) in the Prisma schema). The
   * server will populate `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps on the new
   * row and initialize `account_status` according to product policy (for
   * example, 'active' or 'unverified').
   *
   * Role-specific integration and business context: Registration is a public
   * operation (no prior authentication required). The created user record is
   * the same entity referenced by todo rows via `todo_app_todos.user_id`,
   * enabling the app to later associate todos to this account. The operation
   * ties into audit/auditing flows when admin review is required (audit entries
   * may be created in `todo_app_audit_records` by administrative processes, not
   * by this public join operation).
   *
   * Security considerations: The server MUST never store plaintext passwords;
   * instead it MUST produce a secure `password_hash` and store it in
   * `todo_app_user.password_hash`. Email uniqueness is enforced by the Prisma
   * schema unique constraint on `email`; the server MUST handle duplicate-email
   * errors gracefully. Returned tokens should be short-lived access tokens (for
   * example, JWT) with a refresh token mechanism; the
   * `todo_app_user.last_active_at` and `todo_app_user.updated_at` columns may
   * be updated on successful immediate authentication after registration.
   *
   * Related operations and workflow integration: Typical next operations after
   * successful join are `login` (if the server requires explicit login after
   * verification) and `refresh` to renew tokens. If email verification is
   * enabled by product policy, the server may create an out-of-band
   * verification flow; note that there is no explicit `email_verified` column
   * in `todo_app_user` in the Prisma schema, so verification state must be
   * represented within `account_status` or an external store.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Registration payload for creating a new user account. Contains
   *   a valid email and plaintext password. Optional display_name may be
   *   included.

  /**
   * Authenticate a TodoApp user (login against todo_app_user).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This endpoint authenticates a user record from the
   * `todo_app_user` table. It uses `email` to locate the account and verifies
   * secrets against `todo_app_user.password_hash`. Successful authentication
   * results in issuance of authorization material (access token and refresh
   * token) and a response representing the authenticated user.
   *
   * Implementation details and required fields: Request must include `email`
   * and password. The server will check `todo_app_user.email` (unique by
   * schema) and verify the secret against `todo_app_user.password_hash`. On
   * success the server SHOULD update `todo_app_user.last_active_at` and
   * `todo_app_user.updated_at` to reflect activity and may set or confirm
   * `account_status` (for example, deny login when `account_status` is
   * 'suspended').
   *
   * Role-specific integration and business context: Login is a public operation
   * used to obtain session tokens that allow management of todos owned by the
   * authenticated user (todos are associated via `todo_app_todos.user_id`). The
   * tokens returned by this endpoint are used by subsequent protected
   * operations.
   *
   * Security considerations: Implement strong rate limiting for failed login
   * attempts and ensure errors do not leak whether an email exists. Because the
   * Prisma schema contains `password_hash` but not refresh-token storage
   * columns, refresh token lifecycle may be managed by a dedicated token store
   * external to the `todo_app_user` table; however `todo_app_user.updated_at`
   * and `todo_app_user.last_active_at` are available within the schema to
   * record activity.
   *
   * Related operations and workflow integration: Typical complementary
   * operations include `refresh` to renew an access token and `changePassword`
   * (authenticated) to update `todo_app_user.password_hash` for the account.
   * Admin suspend/reactivate actions also interact with
   * `todo_app_user.account_status` (managed by admin flows recorded in
   * `todo_app_audit_records`).
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Login payload containing `email` and `password` to authenticate
   *   an existing user.

  /**
   * Refresh access token for a TodoApp user (ties to todo_app_user identity).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This endpoint renews an access token using a valid
   * refresh token for a user record that exists in `todo_app_user`. The refresh
   * flow ties the presented refresh token to the user identity so the server
   * can return a fresh access token and possibly rotate the refresh token.
   *
   * Implementation details and required fields: Request payload should include
   * a valid refresh token. Because the Prisma schema does not include an
   * explicit refresh-token storage column, refresh token management is
   * typically implemented using a separate token store; however the operation
   * will still update `todo_app_user.last_active_at` and
   * `todo_app_user.updated_at` to reflect the renewed session activity for
   * auditing and presence metrics.
   *
   * Role-specific integration and business context: Refresh is a public
   * endpoint that accepts a valid refresh token to provide continued
   * authenticated access without re-entering credentials. The refreshed tokens
   * continue to permit operations on `todo_app_todos` rows owned by the user
   * (via `todo_app_todos.user_id`).
   *
   * Security considerations: Ensure refresh tokens are rotated or invalidated
   * on logout or account suspension (check and propagate
   * `todo_app_user.account_status` to deny refresh when suspended). Monitor and
   * record suspicious refresh activity in `todo_app_audit_records` when
   * appropriate.
   *
   * Related operations and workflow integration: `refresh` is commonly used
   * after `login` and before protected operations; it complements `join` and
   * `login` flows and should be part of the token lifecycle design alongside
   * revocation and rotation strategies.
