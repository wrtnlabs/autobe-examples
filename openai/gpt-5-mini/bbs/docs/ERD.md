Moderation case entity that aggregates related reports and moderation
logs for administrator investigation, escalation, and appeals processing.
Contains operational metadata for triage, assignment, legal hold
flagging, and case lifecycle timestamps. Cases provide a single
coordination point for researchers and admins while preserving immutable
moderation_logs for audit.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `assigned_moderator_id`
  > Moderator assigned to manage the case {@link
  > econ_political_forum_moderator.id}. Nullable when unassigned.
- `owner_admin_id`
  > Administrator owner or final approver for the case {@link
  > econ_political_forum_administrator.id}. Nullable.
- `lead_report_id`
  > Representative report id that initiated the case {@link
  > econ_political_forum_reports.id}. Stored as uuid rather than a DB-level
  > foreign key to avoid circular dependency.
- `case_number`
  > Human-friendly unique case identifier used in operations and
  > communication (e.g., 'CASE-2025-0001').
- `title`: Short case title summarizing the issue for quick identification.
- `status`
  > Lifecycle status of the case (e.g.,
  > 'open','investigating','closed','on_hold').
- `priority`: Operational priority label (e.g., 'low','normal','high','urgent').
- `summary`
  > Concise summary or executive note for the case; suitable for dashboards
  > and quick reviews.
- `escalation_reason`
  > If escalated, the reason for escalation (e.g.,
  > 'legal','law_enforcement','coordinated_activity').
- `legal_hold`
  > Whether a legal hold applies to the case and associated evidence; when
  > true archival/deletion operations must be inhibited.
- `created_at`: Case creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp for the case.
- `closed_at`: Timestamp when the case was closed/resolved.
- `deleted_at`: Soft-delete timestamp for the case record (rare).

### `econ_political_forum_notifications`

User-facing notification events. Each record represents a single
notification targeted to a registered user (recipient). Notifications are
append-only events by business practice with soft-delete support. Records
contain a small, flexible JSON payload (stored as string) for extensible
delivery payloads (mentions, replies, moderation actions, system
messages). Key relations: recipient ({@link
econ_political_forum_registereduser.id}), optional actor ({@link
econ_political_forum_registereduser.id}) who triggered the notification,
and optional references to related domain entities (thread, post,
moderation_case) stored as UUIDs for cross-component linkage. Optimized
for fast per-recipient reads and supports marking notifications as read,
delivery timestamps, and light audit fields.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `registereduser_id`
  > Recipient registered user's {@link
  > econ_political_forum_registereduser.id}.
- `actor_registereduser_id`
  > Optional actor (triggering user) {@link
  > econ_political_forum_registereduser.id}. Nullable when system-generated.
- `type`: Notification type code (e.g., 'mention', 'reply', 'moderation', 'system').
- `title`
  > Short human-readable title for the notification. Optional; used in UI
  > summaries.
- `body`: Optional short message body or plain-text excerpt for display in lists.
- `payload`
  > Flexible JSON payload (serialized as string) containing structured
  > delivery data (links to thread/post ids, excerpt, metadata).
- `is_read`: Whether the recipient has marked this notification as read.
- `delivered_at`
  > When the notification was delivered to the user (for push/email).
  > Nullable if not yet delivered or for in-app only events.
- `created_at`: Record creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: Record last update timestamp.
- `deleted_at`
  > Soft-delete timestamp. When set, notification is treated as removed from
  > normal listings but retained for audit.
- `related_thread_id`
  > Optional related thread id (referencing {@link
  > econ_political_forum_threads.id}) stored as UUID for linkage. Nullable to
  > avoid hard FK to other component in this schema file.
- `related_post_id`
  > Optional related post id (referencing {@link
  > econ_political_forum_posts.id}) stored as UUID for linkage.
- `related_moderation_case_id`
  > Optional related moderation case id (referencing {@link
  > econ_political_forum_moderation_cases.id}) stored as UUID for linkage.

### `econ_political_forum_notification_preferences`

Per-user notification delivery preferences. One row per registered user
controls channel-level toggles (in-app, email, push) and a flexible JSON
string for per-notification-type overrides. Designed to be small and
infrequently updated; referenced when enqueuing or delivering
notifications. Links to registered users via a one-to-one foreign key
constraint.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `registereduser_id`
  > Belonged registered user's {@link
  > econ_political_forum_registereduser.id}. One-to-one relationship enforced
  > with a unique constraint.
- `in_app`: Whether in-app notifications are enabled for the user.
- `email`: Whether email notifications are enabled for the user.
- `push`: Whether push notifications are enabled for the user.
- `preferences_payload`
  > Optional JSON-serialized per-type preference overrides (e.g.,
  > {"mentions": {"email": false}}) stored as string for portability.
- `created_at`: Record creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: Record last update timestamp.
- `deleted_at`: Soft-delete timestamp for preference records.

### `econ_political_forum_audit_logs`

Immutable audit log entries capturing system and moderation events for
compliance and incident investigation. Each record references acting
principals and related objects (post, thread, report, moderation case).
Relations intentionally use nullable foreign keys and MUST use SET NULL
or RESTRICT on delete to preserve audit history when referenced objects
are removed. This model is append-only and classified as a snapshot for
retention and legal export workflows.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `registereduser_id`
  > Acting user's [econ_political_forum_registereduser.id](#econ_political_forum_registereduser). Nullable
  > for system actions.
- `moderator_id`
  > Acting moderator's [econ_political_forum_moderator.id](#econ_political_forum_moderator). Nullable
  > when action is not by a moderator.
- `post_id`
  > Referenced post [econ_political_forum_posts.id](#econ_political_forum_posts). Nullable to
  > preserve audit when posts are removed.
- `thread_id`
  > Referenced thread [econ_political_forum_threads.id](#econ_political_forum_threads). Nullable to
  > preserve audit when threads are removed.
- `report_id`
  > Associated report [econ_political_forum_reports.id](#econ_political_forum_reports). Nullable to
  > preserve audit records independent of report lifecycle.
- `moderation_case_id`
  > Associated moderation case {@link
  > econ_political_forum_moderation_cases.id}. Nullable to preserve audit
  > records independent of case lifecycle.
- `action_type`
  > Categorical action type (e.g., 'create', 'edit', 'delete', 'hide',
  > 'warn', 'suspend', 'escalate', 'legal_disclosure').
- `target_type`
  > Type of target object (e.g.,
  > 'post','thread','user','report','moderation_case').
- `target_identifier`
  > Canonical identifier of the target as a string for cross-domain queries;
  > nullable when not applicable.
- `details`
  > Free-text or JSON-serialized details of the event (evidence snapshot,
  > moderator rationale, metadata). Keep size reasonable; heavy binary
  > artifacts should be stored externally and referenced by
  > evidence_reference.
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the audit entry was recorded (ISO 8601).
- `created_by_system`
  > Whether the entry was generated by an automated system (true) or by a
  > human actor (false).

### `econ_political_forum_legal_holds`

Legal hold records that prevent deletion or purging of content subject to
legal or investigatory requirements. Holds must persist independently of
target object lifecycle; relations use nullable FKs and application/DB
logic must prevent purge while holds are active. Classified as subsidiary
because holds support enforcement rather than user-facing CRUD.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `registereduser_id`
  > Administrator or legal officer who placed the hold. {@link
  > econ_political_forum_registereduser.id}. Nullable when placed by
  > system/legal process.
- `post_id`
  > If the hold targets a specific post, reference to {@link
  > econ_political_forum_posts.id}. Nullable when the hold targets a thread
  > or case.
- `thread_id`
  > If the hold targets a thread, reference to {@link
  > econ_political_forum_threads.id}. Nullable when not applicable.
- `moderation_case_id`
  > Optional link to a related moderation case {@link
  > econ_political_forum_moderation_cases.id} that motivated the hold.
- `hold_reason`
  > Short human-readable reason for the legal hold (e.g., 'subpoena', 'law
  > enforcement request', 'litigation').
- `hold_start`: Timestamp when the hold became effective (ISO 8601).
- `hold_end`: Optional timestamp when the hold is scheduled to end; null if indefinite.
- `is_active`: Whether the hold is currently active and prevents purging.
- `notes`
  > Optional free-text notes or case identifiers for internal use; do not
  > expose sensitive PII in this field without access controls.
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the hold record was created.
