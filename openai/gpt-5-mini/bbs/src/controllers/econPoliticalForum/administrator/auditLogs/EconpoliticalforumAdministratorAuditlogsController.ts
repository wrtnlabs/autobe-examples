  /**
   * Search and retrieve a paginated list of audit log entries (admin only) from
   * econ_political_forum_audit_logs.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered, paginated list of audit log entries from the system
   * audit log (econ_political_forum_audit_logs model).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation enables administrators to search and
   * enumerate immutable audit events recorded by the platform for incident
   * investigation, compliance review, and moderation auditing. The returned
   * entries correspond to the Prisma model econ_political_forum_audit_logs and
   * include references to related objects (post, thread, report,
   * moderation_case) when present. The audit log schema is append-only and does
   * not include a soft-delete field; implementers must not rely on deleted_at
   * filtering.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access to audit logs is restricted to
   * administrator role. The operation MUST validate the caller's administrative
   * privileges and MUST record access to this endpoint in system audit logs
   * (server-side). The `details` field is considered sensitive and MUST be
   * redacted in default responses; viewing raw `details` requires explicit
   * elevated privilege and must be recorded in the audit trail. Exports of
   * audit data require an approved compliance workflow and must follow
   * redaction rules.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: The request body accepts complex search
   * criteria (actor, moderator, action_type, target_type, target_identifier,
   * moderation_case_id, report_id, date range (created_at start/end),
   * created_by_system flag), pagination, and sorting. The server shall enforce
   * reasonable limits on page size and complexity to avoid expensive queries.
   * Invalid UUIDs or malformed date ranges return 400 with field-level details.
   * If filters match no records, return an empty page with pagination
   * metadata.
   *
   * Related operations: Use GET
   * /econPoliticalForum/administrator/auditLogs/{auditLogId} to obtain a single
   * audit entry's detailed record; use moderation/case endpoints to navigate
   * from audit entries to moderation cases and reports.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search, filter, sorting and pagination parameters for audit log
   *   retrieval. Supports actor/moderator filters, action_type, target_type,
   *   target_identifier, moderation_case_id, report_id, date range (created_at
   *   start/end), created_by_system flag, sort (created_at asc/desc) and
   *   pagination (page/cursor, pageSize). Default detail view is redacted;
   *   request for raw detail requires elevated privilege and must be explicitly
   *   requested in DTO.

  /**

   * Retrieve a single immutable audit log entry by id.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: Returns the audit log record stored in
   * econ_political_forum_audit_logs for detailed inspection by administrators.
   * Use this for investigations, appeals, and legal compliance checks. The
   * audit log schema is append-only and has no soft-delete field; deletions are
   * administrative/legal actions and must be handled by separate policy and
   * tooling.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access restricted to administrator role. By
   * default the `details` field is redacted; raw `details` requires explicit
   * elevated privilege and must be recorded in the audit trail. If the audit
   * entry references a moderation case with legal_hold=true, require additional
   * entitlement to view raw content and log the access. All accesses to this
   * endpoint MUST be logged by server-side audit mechanisms.
   *
   * Validation and expected behavior: Validate the auditLogId path parameter as
   * a UUID. If the caller is not an authorized administrator, return 403. If
   * the record is not found (including permanently removed per legal/admin
   * action), return 404. For malformed UUIDs return 400. For unexpected server
   * errors return 500 with a standard error envelope.
