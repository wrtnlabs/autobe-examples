   * Update site setting(s) (econ_political_forum_site_settings).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This endpoint updates site-level configuration rows
   * stored in econ_political_forum_site_settings. Typical fields that may be
   * updated include `value`, `description`, `environment`, and `is_public`. The
   * operation must validate key uniqueness per environment and produce audit
   * logs recording changed keys and prior values (stored securely for
   * compliance).
   *
   * Security considerations and permissions: Only administrators are permitted
   * to update site settings. Changes must be logged in the audit trail
   * including acting administrator id, changed key(s), previous values (stored
   * in secure audit), and timestamp. The service layer should prevent exposing
   * sensitive configuration values to non-admin callers even if `is_public` is
   * toggled incorrectly.
   *
   * Relationship to DB and business rules: Prisma model
   * econ_political_forum_site_settings includes: id, key (unique), value,
   * description, environment, is_public, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at.
   * When updating `key`, the service must ensure uniqueness within the
   * specified environment and must return 409 Conflict if the rename would
   * create a duplicate. If the update affects runtime behavior, the response
   * should include metadata advising whether a cache refresh or restart is
   * recommended.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - `key` follows a namespace.form pattern; if renaming, validate pattern and
   *   uniqueness.
   * - `is_public` changes should be audited and limited to administrators.
   * - If an update would violate uniqueness for (key, environment), return 409
   *   Conflict.
   * - Rate limit configuration changes to avoid accidental mass updates
   *   (service-layer policy).
   *
   * Recommended usage patterns:
   *
   * - Prefer updating a single setting by id. If bulk updates are supported by
   *   the implementation, the API must document transactional semantics and
   *   failure handling.
   *
   * Error handling:
   *
   * - 400 Bad Request: invalid payload or key format
   * - 401 Unauthorized: missing/invalid authentication
   * - 403 Forbidden: caller lacks administrator role
   * - 404 Not Found: referenced setting id does not exist
   * - 409 Conflict: attempted update causes duplicate key in same environment
   * - 429 Too Many Requests: rate limiting for high-frequency config edits
   * - 500 Internal Server Error: unexpected server error
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Partial update object for one or more site settings. Each item
   *   should reference the target `id` (UUID) and include only fields to be
   *   changed (for example: `value`, `description`, `environment`,
   *   `is_public`).

  /**
   * Update site setting(s) (econ_political_forum_site_settings).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This endpoint updates site-level configuration rows
   * stored in `econ_political_forum_site_settings`. The model stores `key`,
   * `value`, optional `environment`, `description`, and `is_public` flags. The
   * operation supports partial updates so callers can change one or multiple
   * fields of an existing setting.
   *
   * Security considerations and user permissions: Only administrator roles may
   * update site settings. Changes are high-impact and must be logged in the
   * audit trail with the acting administrator id, changed keys, previous
   * values, and timestamp. For safety, implementations should enforce
   * validation rules and optionally require additional confirmation for keys
   * that control moderation thresholds or feature flags.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying database entities: The Prisma model
   * `econ_political_forum_site_settings` includes `id`, `key` (unique),
   * `value`, `description`, `environment`, `is_public`, `created_at`,
   * `updated_at`, and `deleted_at`. Business logic should ensure `key`
   * uniqueness is not violated when renaming keys and should validate that
   * `environment` (if provided) matches allowed environment identifiers used by
   * the deployment.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - The `key` follows a convention like `namespace.form` (for example
   *   `moderation.report_threshold`) â€” service-layer validation should verify
   *   the key pattern if renaming is supported.
   * - If the request attempts to update `key` to a value that already exists
   *   (same environment), the operation must return 409 Conflict.
   * - `is_public` controls whether non-admin clients may read the setting;
   *   changing this flag should be permitted only to administrators and must be
   *   audited.
   * - Changes that affect runtime behavior (for example enabling/disabling a
   *   feature) may require application cache/in-memory refresh; the API MUST
   *   return metadata indicating whether a restart or cache refresh is
   *   recommended.
   *
   * Related operations and expected behavior:
   *
   * - GET /siteSettings (not included here) should return settings filtered by
   *   `environment` and obey `is_public` for non-admin callers.
   * - A companion endpoint to create or delete keys may exist; this operation
   *   performs partial updates only.
   *
   * Error handling:
   *
   * - 400 Bad Request: invalid payload or key format.
   * - 401 Unauthorized: missing or invalid authentication.
   * - 403 Forbidden: caller lacks administrator role.
   * - 404 Not Found: referenced setting id does not exist.
   * - 409 Conflict: attempted update results in duplicate key for the same
   *   environment.
   * - 429 Too Many Requests: aggressive configuration changes limited by rate
   *   limiting policy.
   * - 500 Internal Server Error: unexpected server error.

   *
   * Retrieve a single site setting record by its unique identifier.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation returns the canonical site
   * configuration entry stored in the econ_political_forum_site_settings table.
   * The response includes the configuration key, its current string value (when
   * permitted), an optional description, the environment scope (for example:
   * 'production' or 'staging'), a visibility flag (is_public), and timestamps
   * for creation and last update. This endpoint is intended for administrative
   * inspection and operational UIs.
   *
   * Security considerations and permissions: Access to the full site setting
   * record (including the raw 'value') is restricted to administrators. Server
   * MUST NOT return raw `value` to non-administrator callers. Any administrator
   * read of a setting classified as sensitive MUST be logged to
   * econ_political_forum_audit_logs with actor id, timestamp, request id, and
   * target id. Calling systems must avoid using this endpoint from public or
   * unauthenticated contexts.
   *
   * Relationship to database entity: This operation maps directly to the Prisma
   * model econ_political_forum_site_settings and returns fields: id, key, value
   * (subject to masking rules), description, environment, is_public,
   * created_at, updated_at, deleted_at.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic: The path parameter siteSettingId must
   * be a UUID. If the record is soft-deleted (deleted_at not null), the
   * operation should return 404 unless the caller has an elevated audit role
   * that is allowed to view deleted entries. If the key is present but flagged
   * is_public = true, a separate public listing endpoint should be used for
   * non-admin consumers; this endpoint requires administrator role by default.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling: 200 returns the site setting object
   * (with `value` only for authorized admin callers). 400 for invalid UUID
   * format, 401/403 for unauthorized access, 404 if not found or not visible,
   * 500 for server errors. All errors use the standard error envelope.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param siteSettingId Unique identifier (UUID) of the target site setting
