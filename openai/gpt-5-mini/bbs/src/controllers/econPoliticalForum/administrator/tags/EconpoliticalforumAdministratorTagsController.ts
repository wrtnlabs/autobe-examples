   * Create a new tag in econ_political_forum_tags (administrator only).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: Create a new normalized tag that can be attached to
   * threads for discovery and search. Tags are stored in the
   * econ_political_forum_tags table in the Prisma schema. The created resource
   * corresponds to IEconPoliticalForumTag and will contain the canonical fields
   * (id, name, slug, description, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at).
   *
   * Security considerations and permissions: Only platform administrators
   * should be allowed to create new tags to maintain taxonomy quality and avoid
   * fragmentation. The endpoint requires administrative authorization. Creation
   * attempts by non-administrators must return 403. Successful creations SHOULD
   * be recorded in audit/moderation logs for traceability.
   *
   * Relationship to database entity: This operation inserts a row into
   * econ_political_forum_tags. The application MUST enforce uniqueness of slug
   * and name at the business layer (the Prisma schema already defines unique
   * constraints on slug and name). The API should validate the slug is
   * URL-friendly before inserting.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - Request must include required create fields (name and slug) as defined by
   *   IEconPoliticalForumTag.ICreate.
   * - The server must reject requests that violate unique constraints for slug or
   *   name with a 409 Conflict response indicating which field conflicts.
   * - Clients MUST NOT supply server-managed fields: id, created_at, updated_at,
   *   or deleted_at. These are set by the server.
   * - If provided, description is optional.
   * - If the operation is successful the server returns the newly created
   *   IEconPoliticalForumTag with 201 status and a Location header pointing to
   *   /econPoliticalForum/tags/{tagId}.
   *
   * Related operations and notes:
   *
   * - GET /econPoliticalForum/tags/{tagId} can be used to retrieve the created
   *   tag.
   * - Tag creation is an administrative action; consider logging the creation in
   *   moderation/audit logs for traceability.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling:
   *
   * - 201: returns created IEconPoliticalForumTag payload and Location header.
   * - 400: missing required fields or invalid slug format.
   * - 401: authentication required.
   * - 403: caller lacks administrator privileges.
   * - 409: uniqueness conflict on name or slug.
   * - 500: unexpected server error.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Tag creation payload (IEconPoliticalForumTag.ICreate). Clients
   *   MUST provide name and slug; do not supply id or timestamp fields.

  /**
   * Update a tag in econ_political_forum_tags (IEconPoliticalForumTag).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: Update the mutable attributes of an existing tag
   * record. This operation allows administrators to correct or improve tag
   * metadata (name, slug, description) used for discovery and categorization
   * across threads.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only users with the administrator role are
   * authorized to call this endpoint. All successful updates should be recorded
   * in system audit/moderation logs to preserve change history and support
   * rollback or review.
   *
   * Relationship to Prisma schema entity: This operation maps to the Prisma
   * model `econ_political_forum_tags`. Per the model comments, tags are a
   * normalized catalog used for discovery and search; the model enforces unique
   * `name` and `slug` constraints and supports soft-delete via `deleted_at`.
   * Implementations must respect those constraints and avoid modifying the tag
   * `id` or removing historical references.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - `name` and `slug` must be unique among active (non-deleted) tags;
   *   uniqueness violations return 409 Conflict.
   * - `slug` should be a URL-safe, lower-case identifier (the application should
   *   normalize and validate input).
   * - Reasonable length limits should be enforced (for example: name 1-100 chars,
   *   slug 1-100 chars, description up to 2000 chars) and exceeded limits
   *   should return 400 with field details.
   * - If the target tag has `deleted_at` set (soft-deleted), the operation SHALL
   *   return 404 Not Found or 409 Conflict per policy (implementation choice)
   *   describing that the resource is not available for update.
   *
   * Related operations: Use GET /tags/{tagId} (not part of this generation) to
   * retrieve current tag details before updating; use POST /tags to create new
   * tags. When name/slug changes affect search indices, ensure any search index
   * materialized views or full-text indexes are refreshed.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling:
   *
   * - Success: returns the updated IEconPoliticalForumTag representation.
   * - 400: validation error (field-specific message describing constraint
   *   violation).
   * - 401/403: unauthorized or insufficient privileges.
   * - 404: tag not found or soft-deleted (if implementation chooses 404 for
   *   deleted resources).
   * - 409: unique constraint conflict (slug or name already used by an active
   *   tag).
   * - 500: internal server error for unexpected failures.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param tagId Unique identifier (UUID) of the target tag
   *   (econ_political_forum_tags.id)
   * @param body Fields to update on the tag. Use IEconPoliticalForumTag.IUpdate
   *   structure. Immutable fields such as id are not accepted. Provide only
   *   fields you want to change.

  /**
   * Soft-delete a tag from econ_political_forum_tags (set deleted_at).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation marks a tag as deleted by setting its
   * `deleted_at` timestamp. Soft deletion preserves the record for audit,
   * moderation, and legal compliance while removing the tag from normal active
   * lists and preventing new assignments.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only users with the administrator role are
   * permitted to perform this operation. Soft-deletes and the rationale for
   * deletion should be recorded in the audit logs so actions are traceable.
   *
   * Relationship to Prisma schema entity: This operation targets the Prisma
   * model `econ_political_forum_tags` which includes a `deleted_at` DateTime?
   * column. Because the schema supports soft-delete, this operation implements
   * soft deletion (not hard removal). Implementers should also consider
   * handling the related join table `econ_political_forum_thread_tags` per
   * product policy (either soft-delete the joins or leave them and exclude
   * deleted tags from active lookups).
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - If the tag does not exist or is already soft-deleted, return 404 Not Found.
   * - If a legal hold or retention constraint prevents deletion of the tag or
   *   related evidence, return 409 Conflict with details.
   * - The operation should be idempotent: repeated deletes on an already-deleted
   *   resource may return 204 No Content or 404 depending on chosen semantics;
   *   document chosen behavior in API docs.
   *
   * Related operations: Use GET /tags to list active tags, and POST /tags to
   * create a replacement tag if needed. Administrators may restore soft-deleted
   * tags using a restore endpoint (not included here) which would clear
   * deleted_at.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling:
   *
   * - Success: 204 No Content (or 200 with short confirmation payload) indicating
   *   tag is soft-deleted.
   * - 401/403: unauthorized or insufficient privileges.
   * - 404: tag not found or already deleted.
