  /**
   * List legal holds for a post (administrator only).
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * Return legal hold entries that apply to a particular post. Legal holds
   * signal that evidence or content must be preserved for legal, investigatory,
   * or compliance reasons. This endpoint provides administrators with the
   * metadata needed to assess hold scope and timing.
   *
   * Security and permissions:
   *
   * Access to legal-hold metadata is restricted to administrators. Calls must
   * be authorized and authenticated; access attempts by non-administrators must
   * be rejected and audited.
   *
   * Relationship to Prisma DB and entities:
   *
   * Data returned originates from the `econ_political_forum_legal_holds` table
   * and is filtered by `post_id` matching the provided path parameter. The
   * response includes the model's canonical fields (id, registereduser_id,
   * post_id, thread_id, moderation_case_id, hold_reason, hold_start, hold_end,
   * is_active, notes, created_at). The endpoint must not invent or surface
   * fields not present in the model.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - The `postId` path parameter MUST be a valid UUID; otherwise the API MUST
   *   return a 400 error with a clear message.
   * - Only administrator-role callers are permitted; unauthorized requests MUST
   *   return 403.
   * - The endpoint supports pagination and simple filters (is_active boolean and
   *   hold_start/hold_end date ranges). If no holds exist, return an empty
   *   paginated data set (200). The endpoint is read-only and does not alter
   *   hold states.
   *
   * Related operations and usage:
   *
   * - GET /threads/{threadId}/legalHolds lists holds tied to a thread-level
   *   scope.
   * - Administrative write APIs (create/release holds) are separate and must
   *   produce audit log entries and enforce hold effects throughout
   *   deletion/purge flows.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling:
   *
   * - 200: Paginated result set of legal holds for the given postId.
   * - 400: Malformed postId or invalid filter parameters.
   * - 403: Caller lacks administrator privileges.
   * - 404: Post not found (or 200 with empty list when no holds exist, per API
   *   design preference).
   * - 500: Internal server error; log details server-side and return a generic
   *   error message to clients.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier (UUID) of the target post whose legal holds
   *   will be listed.
