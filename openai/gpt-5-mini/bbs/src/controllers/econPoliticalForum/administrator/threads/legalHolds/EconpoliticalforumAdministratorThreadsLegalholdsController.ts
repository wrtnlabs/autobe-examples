  /**
   * List legal holds for a thread (administrator only).
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * Retrieve the list of legal hold records associated with a single thread.
   * Legal holds are administrative records indicating that the referenced
   * content (thread or related posts) must be preserved and not purged due to
   * legal or investigatory requirements. This endpoint returns metadata about
   * each hold so administrators can review hold reason, scope, active window,
   * and related case identifiers.
   *
   * Security and permissions:
   *
   * This endpoint exposes sensitive information and is restricted to
   * administrative users. Only users with administrator privileges may call
   * this operation. The system must verify caller authorization before
   * returning any legal-hold records and must log access in the audit trail for
   * compliance.
   *
   * Relationship to Prisma DB and entities:
   *
   * Results are sourced from the `econ_political_forum_legal_holds` Prisma
   * model which includes (among others) the fields: `id`, `registereduser_id`
   * (holder), `post_id`, `thread_id`, `moderation_case_id`, `hold_reason`,
   * `hold_start`, `hold_end`, `is_active`, `notes`, and `created_at`. Records
   * returned by this endpoint are those where `thread_id` equals the provided
   * path parameter. The endpoint must not attempt to infer or return fields
   * that are not stored in that table.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - The `threadId` path parameter MUST be a valid UUID. Requests with malformed
   *   UUIDs MUST return 400 with a clear error message.
   * - Only administrator-role callers MAY access the data; unauthorized requests
   *   MUST return 403.
   * - The API supports pagination and lightweight filtering (query parameters)
   *   for `is_active` (true/false) and date-range filters on `hold_start`
   *   and/or `hold_end`. If no filters are provided, return recent holds first,
   *   paginated.
   * - This is a read-only operation and MUST NOT change
   *   `econ_political_forum_legal_holds` records or release holds.
   *
   * Related operations and usage:
   *
   * - Use GET /posts/{postId}/legalHolds to list legal holds targeted at a
   *   specific post (sibling endpoint).
   * - Administrative APIs that create, update, or release legal holds are
   *   separate secured endpoints (not part of this operation) and should emit
   *   audit log entries and, when applicable, apply legal hold flags that
   *   prevent purge flows.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling:
   *
   * - 200: Returns a paginated list of legal hold records matching the threadId
   *   and optional filters.
   * - 400: Invalid threadId format or invalid filter parameters.
   * - 403: Caller not authorized (requires administrator role).
   * - 404: Thread not found (if the threadId does not exist) or no holds found
   *   (200 with empty data is preferred for no holds).
   * - 500: Internal server error. Implementers should log details server-side and
   *   return a generic error to clients.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param threadId Unique identifier (UUID) of the target thread whose legal
   *   holds will be listed.
