  /**
   * Retrieve filtered, paginated list of moderation reports (moderator/admin).
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of moderation reports from the
   * `econ_political_forum_reports` table. This operation is intended for
   * moderators and administrators to triage incoming reports. It supports
   * complex search criteria including full-text search on reporter_text,
   * filters by status and priority, filtering by reported_post_id or
   * reported_thread_id, date ranges (created_at, triaged_at), reporter
   * anonymity filter, and assignment to moderation cases.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only authenticated moderator or administrator
   * roles should access this endpoint. The service MUST ensure reporter
   * anonymity is honored: when reporter_anonymous is true, reporter identifying
   * fields SHALL be omitted or redacted in responses to non-admin consumers.
   * Pagination results SHOULD be limited for UI performance and rate-limited
   * for safety.
   *
   * Relationship to DB entities: This operation reads the
   * `econ_political_forum_reports` model and may join to related tables (posts,
   * threads, moderation_cases, registereduser) for display purposes. The
   * response SHOULD not expose internal-only fields like internal audit
   * references unless the caller is an administrator.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: Request payload must validate pagination
   * parameters (page/limit or cursor), allowed sort fields (created_at,
   * priority, status), and search string lengths. The backend SHOULD enforce
   * maximum page size and rate limits per user role.
   *
   * Related operations: Use `GET /reports/{reportId}` to retrieve full details
   * for a single report and use moderator endpoints to take actions (dismiss,
   * escalate) on individual reports.
   *
   * Error handling: On validation errors return 400; unauthorized access
   * returns 401/403; rate limiting returns 429; unexpected server errors return
   * 500.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Filter, pagination, sorting and search parameters for report
   *   listing

  /**
   * Get moderation report details by ID (moderator/admin).
   *
   * Retrieve full details of a single moderation report by reportId from the
   * `econ_political_forum_reports` model.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation returns a single report record
   * including reporter metadata (reporter_id, reporter_anonymous), the reported
   * target (reported_post_id or reported_thread_id), reason_code,
   * reporter_text, status, priority, triage timestamps (triaged_at,
   * reviewed_at, resolved_at), and links to moderation_case_id and moderator_id
   * where available.
   *
   * Security considerations and permissions: Access restricted to moderators
   * and administrators. The service MUST enforce reporter anonymity: if
   * reporter_anonymous is true, reporter_id and any personally identifying
   * fields MUST be withheld from non-admin consumers. Administrators may
   * receive additional fields for legal and audit workflows.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying DB entities: This operation reads
   * `econ_political_forum_reports` and may join to
   * `econ_political_forum_posts`, `econ_political_forum_threads`,
   * `econ_political_forum_moderation_cases`,
   * `econ_political_forum_moderation_logs`, and
   * `econ_political_forum_registereduser` for a complete view.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: The path parameter `reportId` MUST be a
   * valid UUID. If the report does not exist, return 404. If the report is
   * archived (deleted_at set on the report), the endpoint should indicate
   * archival status and include guidance or links to legal/appeals workflows
   * where applicable.
   *
   * Related API operations: `PATCH /reports` for search/listing; moderator
   * action endpoints (e.g., /moderation/cases) to take actions and record
   * moderation logs.
   *
   * Error handling: Return 400 for invalid UUID format, 401/403 for
   * unauthorized requests, 404 if not found or not visible to the caller, 429
   * for rate-limiting, and 500 for server errors.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param reportId Unique identifier (UUID) of the target report
