  /**
   * List and search the authenticated user's notifications (paginated,
   * read-only).
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * Retrieve a paginated, filterable list of notification summaries for the
   * currently authenticated registered user. Returned items are optimized for
   * list views and include: id, type, title, is_read, created_at, related ids
   * (related_thread_id, related_post_id) and a short payload excerpt. This
   * endpoint only reads stored events and does not mutate notification state.
   *
   * Security and permissions:
   *
   * This endpoint requires an authenticated registered user. The server MUST
   * verify that the authenticated subject's id equals each
   * notification.registereduser_id returned. Any attempt to access another
   * user's notifications MUST result in 403 Forbidden. Administrator-level
   * cross-user access must be implemented separately and requires administrator
   * role and mandatory audit logging.
   *
   * Relationship to database entities:
   *
   * Reads from econ_political_forum_notifications. Important columns used:
   * registereduser_id, actor_registereduser_id, type, title, body, payload,
   * is_read, delivered_at, related_thread_id, related_post_id,
   * related_moderation_case_id, created_at, deleted_at.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - Pagination defaults: page=1, limit=20. Maximum limit = 100.
   * - Filterable fields: is_read (boolean), type (string), related_thread_id
   *   (uuid), related_post_id (uuid), created_from (ISO 8601), created_to (ISO
   *   8601).
   * - Search: server-side sanitized short-text search over title, body, payload;
   *   relevance sorting is optional when q is provided.
   * - Sorting: created_at (default desc), relevance (when q present), or type.
   * - Deleted notifications (deleted_at not null) are excluded unless explicitly
   *   included by an admin-level query (not supported here).
   *
   * Related operations and error handling:
   *
   * - Use GET /econPoliticalForum/registeredUser/notifications/{notificationId}
   *   to fetch single notification details.
   * - Use PATCH /econPoliticalForum/registeredUser/notifications/mark (or
   *   equivalent) to perform bulk mark-as-read/unread operations (separate
   *   endpoint).
   * - Typical errors: 401 Unauthorized if not authenticated, 403 Forbidden if
   *   accessing another user's records, 400 Bad Request for invalid filters,
   *   429 Too Many Requests for rate limiting, 500 Internal Server Error for
   *   server faults.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search and pagination parameters for notification listing
   *   (read-only). Use IEconPoliticalForumNotification.IRequest to specify
   *   page/cursor, limit, filters (is_read, type, related_thread_id,
   *   related_post_id), search query 'q', sort, and date range. This contract
   *   MUST NOT include any state-changing flags (for example, markAsRead).

  /**
   * Update a notification (mark read/unread, update delivered timestamp).
   *
   * Update a single notification by its unique identifier.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation updates mutable fields of a
   * notification stored in the econ_political_forum_notifications table.
   * Typical uses include marking a notification as read/unread, updating the
   * delivered_at timestamp after delivery, or updating small presentation
   * fields (title, body) when server-side adjustments are required. The
   * operation returns the full, up-to-date notification record after the
   * update.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only an authenticated registered user may call
   * this endpoint to modify notifications. The server MUST enforce that the
   * authenticated user either owns the notification
   * (notification.registereduser_id) or has explicit administrative privileges.
   * The implementation must reject attempts by users to change notifications
   * they do not own with a 403 Forbidden response.
   *
   * Relationship to DB entity: This operation maps to the
   * econ_political_forum_notifications Prisma model. Relevant columns include
   * registereduser_id (recipient), actor_registereduser_id (optional actor),
   * type, title, body, payload, is_read, delivered_at, related_thread_id,
   * related_post_id, related_moderation_case_id, created_at, updated_at, and
   * deleted_at. Do not attempt to update created_at; only mutable fields may be
   * modified.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - NotificationId must be a valid UUID and refer to an existing notification.
   * - Request body must only include fields allowed by
   *   IEconPoliticalForumNotification.IUpdate; server must validate types
   *   (e.g., is_read is boolean, delivered_at is ISO 8601 timestamp if
   *   provided).
   * - Ownership check: the caller must be the recipient (registereduser_id) or an
   *   administrator.
   * - If notification is soft-deleted (deleted_at not null), updates are rejected
   *   unless the caller is an administrator and action explicitly reactivates
   *   the notification.
   * - All successful updates MUST create an audit log entry
   *   (econ_political_forum_audit_logs) recording the acting user,
   *   action_type="update_notification", target_identifier and details
   *   summarizing the change.
   *
   * Related operations: Listing notifications for a user (PATCH
   * /users/{userId}/notifications) and notification delivery endpoints
   * (internal) are typically used together. For programmatic marking-as-read
   * flows, clients should prefer idempotent calls.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param notificationId UUID of the target notification to update
   * @param body Notification fields to update (for example: is_read,
