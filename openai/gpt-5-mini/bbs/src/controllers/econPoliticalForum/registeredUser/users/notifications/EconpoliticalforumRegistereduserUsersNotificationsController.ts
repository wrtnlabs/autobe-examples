  /**
   * Search and list a user's notifications (paginated).
   *
   * List and search notifications for a given user.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation provides a flexible search and
   * pagination interface for a user's notifications stored in
   * econ_political_forum_notifications. Clients may filter by read status,
   * notification type (mention, reply, moderation, system), date ranges
   * (created_at between), and related entity ids (related_thread_id,
   * related_post_id). Results are returned in a paginated container optimized
   * for UI lists.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only the authenticated user identified by
   * {userId} or an administrator can retrieve this list. Implementations MUST
   * enforce that a registered user may only request their own notifications
   * unless the caller holds administrative privileges. The operation must
   * respect per-user notification preferences when computing delivery flags
   * (for example, hide items the user has opted out of via notification
   * preferences if requested by client).
   *
   * Relationship to DB entity: Maps to econ_political_forum_notifications. Key
   * columns used for filtering and projection: registereduser_id, type,
   * is_read, created_at, delivered_at, related_thread_id, related_post_id,
   * related_moderation_case_id, and payload. Returned summaries should include
   * id, type, title, body excerpt, is_read, created_at, and related ids for
   * client linking.
   *
   * Filtering, pagination, and sort rules:
   *
   * - Pagination supports cursor or page/limit patterns in the request payload.
   *   Default page size = 20; maximum page size = 100.
   * - Supported filters: is_read (boolean), type (string), since (ISO 8601),
   *   until (ISO 8601), related_thread_id, related_post_id.
   * - Sorting options: newest, oldest, unread_first, relevance (when full-text
   *   query provided in payload).
   *
   * Validation and behavior:
   *
   * - UserId path parameter must be a valid UUID.
   * - If a registeredUser requests notifications for a different userId, server
   *   returns 403 Forbidden.
   * - Empty result sets return an empty page container with appropriate
   *   pagination metadata.
   *
   * Related operations: Update single notification (PUT
   * /notifications/{notificationId}) for marking-as-read; real-time delivery
   * channels (SSE/WebSocket) are recommended to reduce polling.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Unique identifier of the registered user whose notifications
   *   are requested
   * @param body Search and pagination parameters for notifications (filters,
   *   sort, pagination cursor or page/limit). Default page size=20, max=100.

  /**
   * Update a user's notification read state (mark read/unread) — owner only.
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * This operation updates the read state (is_read) of a single notification
   * for its registered recipient. It maps to the
   * econ_political_forum_notifications model and permits only the user-managed
   * field `is_read` to be changed. The API enforces strict validation and
   * rejects unknown keys to avoid accidental mutation of system-managed
   * notification data.
   *
   * Security considerations and user permissions:
   *
   * Only the authenticated recipient (the registered user whose id equals the
   * path parameter userId) may perform this operation on their own
   * notifications. The implementation MUST verify that the notification's
   * registereduser_id equals the authenticated caller's id and return 403 when
   * ownership is not established. Administrators have separate admin endpoints
   * for broader notification management. Any attempt to modify system-managed
   * fields (payload, delivered_at) via this endpoint must be rejected. If the
   * notification is connected to a moderation or legal case that is subject to
   * a legal hold (econ_political_forum_legal_holds.is_active), implementations
   * should apply policy to prevent prohibited modifications where applicable.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying database entities:
   *
   * This operation updates the `is_read` Boolean on
   * econ_political_forum_notifications. If the notification refers to a
   * moderation case (related_moderation_case_id) and the update should be
   * recorded for audit, the server MUST append an audit entry to
   * econ_political_forum_audit_logs capturing the acting user id, action_type
   * ('notification.mark_read'/'notification.mark_unread'), target identifiers,
   * and timestamp.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - Path parameters (userId and notificationId) MUST be valid UUIDs.
   * - The notification must exist and belong to the provided userId; otherwise
   *   return 404.
   * - The request body MUST contain only the allowed property `is_read`
   *   (boolean). Unknown keys MUST be rejected with 400.
   * - The server MUST sanitize any minimal textual inputs (if any) and must not
   *   accept payload edits via this endpoint.
   *
   * Related operations:
   *
   * - GET /users/{userId}/notifications — list a user's notifications (paginated)
   * - PATCH /users/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId}/read-all — bulk
   *   mark-read (user convenience)
   * - GET /notifications/{id} — admin inspection of a single notification
   *   (admin-only)
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling:
   *
   * - Success: returns 200 with the updated notification object
   *   (IEconPoliticalForumNotification) reflecting the committed `is_read`
   *   change.
   * - 400: validation errors (unknown fields or invalid value types).
   * - 401: unauthenticated caller.

   *
   * Relationship to underlying database entities:

   * This operation updates fields defined on econ_political_forum_notifications
   * such as is_read (boolean), delivered_at (DateTime), payload (JSON string),
   * is_read flag, and related_* references (related_thread_id, related_post_id,
   * related_moderation_case_id). When an update concerns a moderation-related
   * notification (for example changes to related_moderation_case_id or payload
   * referencing a moderation case), the system MUST append an audit entry in
   * econ_political_forum_audit_logs documenting the actor, action_type, target
   * identifiers, and the rationale. The operation should consult
   * econ_political_forum_notification_preferences to respect user delivery
   * preferences when interpreting delivered_at or delivery changes.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - Both path parameters (userId and notificationId) must be valid UUIDs.
   * - The notification must exist and belong to the provided userId; otherwise
   *   return 404.
   * - Only allowed fields in the IEconPoliticalForumNotification.IUpdate DTO are
   *   accepted; the server must reject unknown keys with 400.
   * - If a legal hold exists for the related thread/post/case the operation
   *   attempts to modify, the update must be rejected with 403 and a legal_hold
   *   reason.
   * - All incoming payload data must be sanitized for HTML/Markdown and must not
   *   contain executable scripts or unauthorized references.
