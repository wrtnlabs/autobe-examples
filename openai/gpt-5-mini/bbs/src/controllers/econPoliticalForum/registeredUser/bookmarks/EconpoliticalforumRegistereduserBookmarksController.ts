   * Create a bookmark for the authenticated user.
   *
   * Creates a new bookmark linking the authenticated registered user to an
   * existing post.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation persists a record in the
   * econ_political_forum_bookmarks table. Relevant model fields: id,
   * registereduser_id, post_id, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at. The API
   * accepts the target post identifier in the request body; the server derives
   * registereduser_id from the authenticated session and does not trust a
   * client-supplied owner id.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only authenticated users with the registeredUser
   * role may call this endpoint. The server must verify the caller is not
   * banned or suspended and must validate that the target post
   * (econ_political_forum_posts) exists and is visible to the caller.
   * Unauthenticated requests must receive 401.
   *
   * Validation and expected behavior: Request must include a valid postId
   * (UUID). Responses: 201 Created with the created bookmark record on success;
   * 400 for invalid input; 404 if target post not found or inaccessible; 409
   * Conflict if a non-restorable duplicate exists; 429 when rate limits apply.
   * Implementers SHOULD consider idempotency handling to avoid duplicate
   * creations from retries.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Bookmark creation payload. The server uses the authenticated
   *   user as the bookmark owner; clients must supply the target post id only.

   *
   * Retrieve a paginated, filterable list of bookmark summaries for the
   * requesting registered user.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation allows an authenticated registered
   * user to search and list their saved bookmarks. It queries the
   * `econ_political_forum_bookmarks` table and returns summary items suitable
   * for list displays. Only fields present on the bookmark model are used by
   * the service logic. The response is a paginated summary view optimized for
   * feeds and bookmark management.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access requires an authenticated account with the
   * registeredUser role. The endpoint returns only bookmarks that belong to the
   * requesting user (registereduser_id). The server must verify ownership and
   * deny access to other users' bookmarks. Records subject to legal holds must
   * be preserved by backend retention logic and not purged while under hold.
   *
   * Filtering, pagination, and sorting: The request body supports cursor or
   * page/limit pagination (client may pass page/limit or cursor), filters by
   * post_id or thread_id, created_at date ranges, includeDeleted (boolean), and
   * sort options (created_at desc by default). The server must enforce default
   * page size and maximum page size limits and must sanitize and validate all
   * filters.
   *
   * Business rules and error handling: Only bookmark records owned by the
   * requester will be returned. If the user has no bookmarks, an empty
   * paginated data set is returned. Validation errors return 400 with
   * structured error details. Unauthenticated requests return 401. Rate limits
   * apply to this endpoint to prevent abuse.

   * @param connection
   * @param body Search, filter, and pagination parameters for bookmark listing
   *   (page/cursor, pageSize, filters: postId, threadId, createdFrom,
   *   createdTo, includeDeleted, sort).

   * Purpose and overview: Returns the full bookmark record representing a saved
   * post for the authenticated user. The underlying Prisma table is
   * `econ_political_forum_bookmarks`; the operation returns fields defined on
   * that model and does not invent additional properties.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access requires an authenticated registeredUser.
   * The operation must verify that the bookmark's registereduser_id matches the
   * requesting user's id. If the bookmark does not belong to the requester,
   * return 403 Forbidden. If the bookmark cannot be found (no active record
   * with that id or it is soft-deleted and not visible per requester's
   * permissions), return 404 Not Found.
   *
   * Soft-delete and legal hold behavior: The model includes deleted_at; by
   * default the endpoint returns only active (deleted_at is null) bookmark
   * records. If privileged visibility is requested, server must verify the
   * caller's role and audit the access. Legal holds preventing deletion must be
   * enforced by backend retention logic and not bypassed by this endpoint.
   *
   * Validation and error handling: The path parameter bookmarkId must be a
   * UUID. Invalid format returns 400. Unauthenticated requests return 401.
