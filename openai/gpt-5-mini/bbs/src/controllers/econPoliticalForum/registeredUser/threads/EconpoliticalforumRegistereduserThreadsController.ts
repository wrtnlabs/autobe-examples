  /**
   * Create a new discussion thread (econ_political_forum_threads).
   *
   * Purpose and overview
   *
   * Create a new discussion thread (top-level topic) in the system. This
   * operation writes a new row to the econ_political_forum_threads Prisma model
   * and returns the created thread record. The request SHOULD include a
   * category reference, the thread title, and optional slug and pinned/status
   * hints. The author is derived from the authenticated user (author_id) or
   * explicitly provided where business logic allows delegation; server-side
   * logic MUST verify that the author exists and is permitted to post in the
   * chosen category (for example, check
   * econ_political_forum_categories.requires_verification). The API MUST
   * enforce slug uniqueness (the underlying Prisma model defines slug as
   * unique) and return a 409 conflict when a provided slug already exists.
   *
   * Security and permissions
   *
   * Only authenticated registered users MAY create threads. The caller's role
   * is validated (registeredUser) and additional business checks (account not
   * suspended, email verification when required by the chosen category) MUST be
   * applied. Input must be validated and sanitized to prevent XSS and other
   * content injection; the server MUST strip/escape disallowed HTML or reject
   * inputs that violate the content policy.
   *
   * Relationship to database entities
   *
   * This operation persists a new record in econ_political_forum_threads and
   * references econ_political_forum_categories via category_id and
   * econ_political_forum_registereduser via author_id. The created_at and
   * updated_at timestamps are populated by the server. The deleted_at column is
   * reserved for soft-delete scenarios and is not set by this operation.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic
   *
   * - Title: required, non-empty, sensible length (recommend 5–200 characters).
   * - Slug: optional; if provided the server validates uniqueness and slug
   *   format; if omitted the server may synthesize a slug from the title.
   * - Category_id: required, must reference an active category. If the referenced
   *   category has requires_verification=true then the requestor MUST have a
   *   verified email or appropriate verification status.
   * - Pinned/status: optional hints; server enforces pinned only for privileged
   *   roles (moderator/administrator) regardless of input.
   * - Server MUST sanitize content and enforce policy on political/economic
   *   content per moderation rules.
   *
   * Related operations
   *
   * - POST /posts: create the first post in a thread (client may call after
   *   thread creation) or server may create an initial post automatically
   *   depending on implementation choices.
   * - PATCH /threads (search) and GET /threads/{threadId} can be used to retrieve
   *   created threads.
   *
   * Error handling
   *
   * Return structured error envelope for validation failures (400),
   * authentication errors (401), authorization errors (403), uniqueness
   * conflicts (409), rate limits (429), and unexpected server errors (500).
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Payload to create a new thread. The DTO type
   *   IEconPoliticalForumThread.ICreate includes: category_id (uuid), title
   *   (string), optional slug (string), optional status (string), optional
   *   pinned (boolean). The author is determined by the authenticated user in
   *   normal flows.

  /**
   * Update thread metadata (econ_political_forum_threads) by threadId.
   *
   * Purpose and overview
   *
   * Update metadata for an existing thread identified by threadId. This
   * operation updates permitted fields on the econ_political_forum_threads row
   * such as title, slug, status, and pinned flag, and sets updated_at to the
   * current time. The operation MUST validate incoming values (for example slug
   * uniqueness, title length) and enforce business constraints (only
   * moderators/administrators may set pinned=true; changing category may be
   * restricted). If ownership is required, server-side logic MUST verify that
   * the authenticated registeredUser is the author of the thread or has
   * moderator privileges.
   *
   * Security and permissions
   *
   * Authentication (registeredUser) is required. Authorization checks MUST
   * ensure only permitted principals may update the thread (owner within edit
   * policy window OR moderator/administrator). The API MUST return 403
   * Forbidden if the caller lacks the necessary permissions.
   *
   * Relationship to database entities
   *
   * This operation updates the econ_political_forum_threads record and may
   * touch related indexes used for search. It MUST NOT create or delete related
   * posts, reports, or moderation logs — those are handled by their respective
   * APIs. If the update triggers moderation concerns (for example moving a
   * thread into a moderated category), the server MUST route the thread for
   * moderator review according to category rules.
   *
   * Validation and business logic
   *
   * - ThreadId path parameter: required, UUID format, identifies target thread.
   * - Title: optional, when present validate 5–200 characters.
   * - Slug: optional, validate uniqueness and safe URL characters; if collision
   *   occurs return 409 Conflict.
   * - Status: optional, domain values should match application expectations (for
   *   example 'open', 'closed', 'pinned'); server enforces allowed values.
   * - Pinned: optional, only allowed for moderator/administrator roles; if
   *   present and caller is not privileged, ignore or return 403 based on
   *   policy.
   * - If the thread is under a legal_hold (econ_political_forum_legal_holds),
   *   then updates that would remove evidence or alter history must be
   *   prevented and a 423/403-like response returned. The system should consult
   *   legal hold records before allowing destructive updates.
   *
   * Related operations
   *
   * - GET /threads/{threadId} — retrieve the updated thread.
   * - POST /threads — create new threads.
   * - Moderator endpoints — for forced pinning, moving categories, or other
   *   privileged operations.
   *
   * Error handling
   *
   * Return 400 for validation errors, 401 for unauthenticated requests, 403 for
   * insufficient permissions, 404 if threadId not found or soft-deleted, 409
   * for slug conflicts, 423 for operations blocked by legal hold, 429 for rate
   * limiting, and 500 for unexpected errors.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param threadId Unique identifier of the target thread
   *   (econ_political_forum_threads.id)
   * @param body Payload to update a thread. The DTO type
   *   IEconPoliticalForumThread.IUpdate includes optional fields: title
   *   (string), slug (string), status (string), pinned (boolean). Fields not
   *   present are left unchanged.
