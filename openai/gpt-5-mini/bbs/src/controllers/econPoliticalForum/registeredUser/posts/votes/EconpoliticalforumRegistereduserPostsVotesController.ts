  /**
   * Cast or change a vote on a post.
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * Allow an authenticated registered user to cast or change a vote on a post.
   * Votes are persisted in `econ_political_forum_votes` and are used by ranking
   * and signal systems. The endpoint creates a new vote or updates an existing
   * vote for the (registereduser_id, post_id) pair.
   *
   * Security considerations and permissions:
   *
   * Only authenticated registered users may call this endpoint. The server must
   * verify the caller's identity, ensure the referenced post exists, and
   * prevent self-voting (return 403 if user is the post author).
   * Moderator/admin users acting as registered users must follow internal
   * rules.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - Validate `postId` is a UUID and that the referenced post exists and is not
   *   deleted.
   * - Request body must include an allowed `value` (integer 1 or -1).
   * - Enforce the unique constraint on (registereduser_id, post_id): on conflict
   *   update `value` and `updated_at`.
   * - Support idempotent retries (recommend Idempotency-Key header). Repeated
   *   identical requests should not create duplicates.
   * - Respect rate limits to prevent vote abuse and integrate with abuse
   *   detection to flag anomalies.
   *
   * Errors: 400 for invalid input, 401 for unauthenticated, 403 for self-vote,
   * 404 if post not found, 409 for unrecoverable concurrency conflict (or
   * return 200 with resolved result), 500 for server errors.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier (UUID) of the post to vote on
   * @param body Vote creation payload. Must include the numeric vote value (1
   *   for upvote, -1 for downvote).

  /**
   * Update an existing vote on a post (econ_political_forum_votes).
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * This operation updates an existing vote record for a post. It operates on
   * the econ_political_forum_votes table from the Prisma schema and updates the
   * vote's value and updated_at timestamp. The votes model enforces a unique
   * constraint on (registereduser_id, post_id) to ensure one vote per user per
   * post. Valid vote values are application-defined integers where 1 = upvote
   * and -1 = downvote; the API rejects values outside the allowed set.
   *
   * Security and permissions:
   *
   * Only authenticated users may call this endpoint. In normal flows, the
   * caller must be the vote owner (the registered user who created the vote).
   * Business logic should verify ownership before applying updates. Moderators
   * and administrators may have separate override flows in the moderation APIs;
   * this endpoint is intended for the vote owner to change their vote. The
   * endpoint requires a bearer token from a registeredUser account.
   *
   * Relationship to database entities:
   *
   * This operation updates fields on the econ_political_forum_votes model:
   * value (Int), updated_at (DateTime) and preserves deleted_at (DateTime?)
   * semantics. It also references the target post via post_id
   * (econ_political_forum_posts.id) and the owning registered user via
   * registereduser_id (econ_political_forum_registereduser.id). Implementations
   * should validate that the referenced post exists and is not permanently
   * removed; if the post is under legal_hold or moderation hold
   * (econ_political_forum_legal_holds), the operation may be blocked per
   * business rules.
   *
   * Validation and business rules:
   *
   * - Request must specify a valid UUID for postId and voteId.
   * - The vote update payload must supply a value of 1 or -1 only; other integers
   *   are rejected with 400.
   * - The vote must be active (deleted_at is null). If the vote record is
   *   soft-deleted, the API should return 404 or a specific error indicating
   *   the vote is no longer active.
   * - Enforce idempotency on repeated identical updates: repeated requests
   *   setting the same value should return the canonical current vote
   *   representation without creating duplicates.
   * - Concurrency: update operations should atomically update the value and
   *   updated_at and record an audit entry (via audit logs) to preserve
   *   history.
   *
   * Related operations and error handling:
   *
   * Related APIs include creating a vote (POST /posts/{postId}/votes), deleting
   * a vote (DELETE /posts/{postId}/votes/{voteId}), and moderator/admin
   * endpoints that may invalidate votes. Expected error responses include 400
   * for validation errors (invalid value), 401 for unauthenticated requests,
   * 403 if the caller is not the vote owner, 404 if the post or vote does not
   * exist or is soft-deleted, 409 for concurrency conflicts, 429 for rate
   * limits, and 500 for unexpected server errors. The response includes the
   * updated vote representation on success.
   *
   * Response shape guidance: This operation should return only the canonical
   * vote fields: id, post_id, value, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId UUID of the target post (econ_political_forum_posts.id) the
   *   vote belongs to
   * @param voteId UUID of the vote record to update
   *   (econ_political_forum_votes.id)
   * @param body Vote update payload. Must include the new vote value (1 or -1).

  /**
   * Remove (soft-delete) a vote on a post (econ_political_forum_votes).
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * This operation removes a vote by applying a soft-delete to the
   * econ_political_forum_votes record by setting deleted_at. The Prisma schema
   * for votes includes deleted_at (DateTime?) and therefore the API follows
   * soft-delete behavior so the system can retain an immutable record for audit
   * and abuse analysis while excluding the vote from public score
   * calculations.
   *
   * Security and permissions:
   *
   * Only authenticated registered users may call this endpoint. Typical callers
   * are the vote owner who wants to retract their vote. Business logic must
   * verify that the caller is the owner of the vote (registereduser_id matches
   * caller) before performing the soft-delete. Moderators and administrators
   * may have separate moderator APIs to remove or invalidate votes at scale.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying entities and effects:
   *
   * Soft-deleting a vote must update the vote's deleted_at timestamp and may
   * trigger recalculation or adjustment of public vote aggregates (handled by
   * materialized views or background jobs). The operation references
   * econ_political_forum_posts (post_id) and
   * econ_political_forum_registereduser (registereduser_id); it should validate
   * that the referenced post exists and is not subject to a legal_hold that
   * prevents modification.
   *
   * Validation and business logic:
   *
   * - Path parameters postId and voteId must be valid UUIDs.
   * - If the vote record is already soft-deleted, the endpoint should return 204
   *   No Content (idempotent delete) or 404 depending on policy; recommended
   *   behavior: 204 for idempotency.
   * - If the caller is not the vote owner, return 403 Forbidden.
   * - If a legal hold (econ_political_forum_legal_holds) prevents deletion of the
   *   target vote or associated post, the API must deny the deletion and
   *   surface a clear error indicating a legal hold (423 Locked or 409 Conflict
   *   as implementation choice).
   *
   * Audit, transparency, and error handling:
   *
   * The operation must record an audit log entry describing the deletion (via
   * econ_political_forum_audit_logs) including acting user id, target vote id,
   * target post id, action_type='delete_vote' (or similar), and a brief
   * rationale. Expected error responses include 400 for invalid parameters, 401
   * for unauthenticated requests, 403 for insufficient permissions, 404 for not
   * found (if preferred), 423 or 409 for legal hold/conflict, 429 for rate
   * limits, and 500 for unexpected server errors. Successful response should be
   * 204 No Content.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId UUID of the target post (econ_political_forum_posts.id) the
