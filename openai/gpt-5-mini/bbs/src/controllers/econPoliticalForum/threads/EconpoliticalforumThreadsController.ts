  /**
   * Search and retrieve a paginated list of threads.
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * This operation performs advanced retrieval of threads from the
   * econ_political_forum_threads table. It supports full-text title search
   * (leveraging the title trigram index), filters by category_id, author_id,
   * tag membership (via thread-tags join), status, pinned flag, and date ranges
   * on created_at/updated_at. Results are returned in a paginated container and
   * include thread summary fields optimized for list displays.
   *
   * Security considerations and user permissions:
   *
   * Public read access is allowed for standard public categories, but results
   * must respect category gating: if a category requires verification (refer to
   * econ_political_forum_categories.requires_verification) or is marked
   * moderated (econ_political_forum_categories.is_moderated), the API and
   * implementation must ensure non-verified users do not receive unpublished or
   * pending threads. For authenticated users, results can include restricted
   * content the user is authorized to view. Implement appropriate rate limits
   * to mitigate abuse (for example: create/search throttles per account/IP).
   *
   * Relationship to underlying DB entities:
   *
   * This operation directly queries econ_political_forum_threads and uses its
   * relationships to categories (category_id) and tags (via
   * econ_political_forum_thread_tags) and to author (author_id referencing
   * econ_political_forum_registereduser). The Prisma schema includes indexes
   * for title (gin_trgm_ops) enabling efficient full-text title search; the
   * operation should leverage that index for relevance ranking. Soft-deleted
   * threads (deleted_at non-null) must be excluded from public results unless
   * the requester is an administrator or the request explicitly includes
   * archived content.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - Pagination: support cursor or page/limit patterns with sensible defaults
   *   (default page size 20, max 100).
   * - Search: title search should support partial matches and ranking; include
   *   query sanitization to avoid injection.
   * - Filters: category_id and tag_id filters must be validated as UUIDs; date
   *   range filters must be ISO 8601 timestamps.
   * - Sorting: allow sort by relevance (when a text query is present), newest
   *   (created_at desc), oldest, most-replied or pinned-first.
   * - Visibility: exclude threads in moderated categories that are pending
   *   approval from users without moderator/admin privileges.
   * - Soft-deletes: threads with deleted_at populated are hidden from normal
   *   listings.
   *
   * Related operations:
   *
   * - Use GET /threads/{threadId} to retrieve a single thread with full detail
   *   (including posts and top-level comments).
   * - Use POST/PUT operations (not included here) to create or update threads;
   *   these must populate econ_political_forum_post_revisions when edits
   *   occur.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling:
   *
   * - Return a paginated response with thread summary items and pagination
   *   metadata. 400 on invalid filter values, 401 for private/restricted access
   *   attempts, 429 when rate limits are exceeded, and 500 for unexpected
   *   server errors.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria, pagination and sorting options for thread
   *   retrieval

  /**
   * Get a single thread by ID with details.
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * This operation returns one thread record from the
   * econ_political_forum_threads table identified by the path parameter
   * {threadId}. The response provides full thread metadata needed to render the
   * thread page, including title, author reference (author_id), category
   * reference (category_id), status, pinned flag, and timestamps.
   * Implementations often include top-level posts (first page of posts) in the
   * payload to simplify client rendering.
   *
   * Security considerations and user permissions:
   *
   * The operation must enforce visibility rules: do not return threads that are
   * soft-deleted (deleted_at set) except to administrators or authorized
   * moderators. For categories that require verification (see
   * econ_political_forum_categories.requires_verification) or are moderated
   * (econ_political_forum_categories.is_moderated), ensure the caller has
   * appropriate privileges before returning pending or private items. If the
   * thread is pending moderator approval, return 403 for unauthorized users or
   * 404 to avoid revealing existence when policy requires non-disclosure.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying database entities:
   *
   * This operation uses the econ_political_forum_threads table and joins as
   * needed to author (econ_political_forum_registereduser) and to posts
   * (econ_political_forum_posts) for an optional embedded posts list. The
   * Prisma schema provides trigram indexes on title for search; this endpoint
   * is a point-retrieval and should be served from primary keyed lookup by id
   * (UUID) for best performance.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - Path parameter threadId must be a UUID matching
   *   econ_political_forum_threads.id.
   * - If include parameters request embedding posts or other relations, enforce
   *   pagination for posts, and exclude hidden posts (is_hidden true) from
   *   public responses unless the requester is moderator/admin.
   * - If the thread is soft-deleted (deleted_at not null) and the caller is not
   *   privileged, return 404.
   *
   * Related operations and error handling:
   *
   * - Use PATCH /threads for list/search and GET /threads/{threadId}/posts (or
   *   embedded posts) to fetch paginated posts. 400 for malformed UUIDs, 401
   *   for authentication required when requesting restricted content, 403 for
   *   unauthorized access to pending/moderated content, 404 if not found or
   *   soft-deleted for public user, 500 for unexpected errors.
