  /**
   * Search and retrieve a paginated list of posts.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of posts from the
   * econ_political_forum_posts table.
   *
   * This operation supports full-text search on the post content (content),
   * filtering by thread_id, parent_id (replies), author_id, and date ranges
   * (created_at). Results exclude posts with deleted_at set and exclude
   * moderator-hidden posts (is_hidden = true) for ordinary users. Sorting
   * options include newest, oldest, and most_voted (application-provided
   * aggregate). Pagination supports page/limit or cursor-based continuation;
   * default page size is 20 and maximum page size is 100.
   *
   * Security and permissions: this endpoint is public for read operations. When
   * a moderator or administrator calls the endpoint with proper authorization,
   * additional properties (is_hidden, deleted_at) and hidden items may be
   * returned for moderation purposes. The service layer must enforce role-based
   * filtering and redact moderator-only fields for ordinary users.
   *
   * Relationship to database entities: Operates on the
   * econ_political_forum_posts model as defined in the Prisma schema. Use the
   * thread relation (thread_id) to implement category-scoped listings and the
   * author relation (author_id) to implement author-scoped filters. For
   * vote-based sorting, rely on a separate aggregated view or materialized data
   * source since vote counters are intentionally not stored on the posts
   * table.
   *
   * Validation and error handling: invalid UUID formats for
   * thread_id/parent_id/author_id result in 400. Requests with page sizes above
   * 100 result in 400. Long search queries (>500 chars) result in 400. If a
   * referenced thread or parent post does not exist, return 404. Unexpected
   * server errors return 500.

  /**
   * Retrieve a single post by its ID.
   *
   * Return detailed information for a single post stored in
   * econ_political_forum_posts.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation fetches the full canonical post record
   * referenced by id. The returned details include the content, author
   * reference (author_id), parent relationship (parent_id) for replies, edit
   * metadata (is_edited, edited_at), moderation flag (is_hidden), and
   * timestamps (created_at, updated_at). Revision snapshots are maintained in
   * econ_political_forum_post_revisions and are accessible through a separate
   * endpoint.
   *
   * Security and authorization: For ordinary (public) callers, posts with
   * deleted_at set or is_hidden = true are not returned and the endpoint
   * responds with 404 to prevent leaking removed content. Moderators and
   * administrators with appropriate authorizationRoles may see hidden or
   * deleted posts and receive the is_hidden and deleted_at fields in the
   * response; moderator-only rationale or audit content is available only via
   * moderation endpoints and is not included here.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying schema: This operation maps directly to the
   * econ_political_forum_posts model in the Prisma schema. It uses the author
   * relation to surface minimal author metadata (public profile fields) and the
   * thread relation to include context for where the post appears. For full
   * revision history or moderation logs, the caller should use the post
   * revisions and moderation log endpoints.
   *
   * Validation and error handling: postId must be a UUID. Return 400 for
   * malformed IDs, 404 for non-existent or non-visible posts to the caller, and
   * 500 for server errors.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param postId Unique identifier of the target post (UUID)
