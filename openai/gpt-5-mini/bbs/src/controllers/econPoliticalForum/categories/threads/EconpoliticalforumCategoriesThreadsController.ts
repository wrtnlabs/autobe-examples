  /**
   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of threads inside a category
   * (econ_political_forum_threads).
   *
   * Purpose and overview: Retrieve a filtered, paginated list of discussion
   * threads that belong to the specified category. This endpoint is intended
   * for public browsing of category content and supports advanced filtering,
   * full-text title search, tag-based discovery, author filtering, status and
   * pinned filtering, and sorting. It is implemented against the
   * `econ_political_forum_threads` Prisma model which contains canonical thread
   * metadata.
   *
   * Security and permissions: This endpoint is public by default (no
   * authentication required) and returns only threads the caller is allowed to
   * see. Threads with `deleted_at` set are excluded from results. For
   * categories configured as moderated
   * (`econ_political_forum_categories.is_moderated = true`), threads whose
   * `status` equals 'pending' should be excluded unless the requester has
   * moderator/admin privileges (this endpoint's default behavior excludes
   * 'pending' threads). Any moderator-only expansions must be gated behind
   * proper authentication and role checks.
   *
   * Relationship to the database and related entities: Records are drawn from
   * `econ_political_forum_threads` (fields used: category_id, author_id, title,
   * slug, status, pinned, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at). Tag-based
   * filtering uses the join table `econ_political_forum_thread_tags` and
   * `econ_political_forum_tags.slug` or id. The operation returns summary
   * representations optimized for listing; callers may request expanded details
   * via a separate thread detail endpoint.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic:
   *
   * - The path parameter `categoryId` must be a UUID and correspond to an
   *   existing category (validate existence before executing the query).
   * - By default exclude threads with `deleted_at != null` and threads with
   *   `status = 'pending'` unless the caller is an authorized
   *   moderator/administrator.
   * - Search on title uses trigram / full-text indexing configured on the `title`
   *   column; results should be ranked by relevance when a query is provided.
   * - Pagination supports either cursor-based or page/limit patterns in the
   *   IEconPoliticalForumThread.IRequest DTO. Defaults: page=1, limit=20;
   *   maximum limit = 100.
   * - Sorting supports fields: relevance (when search provided), newest
   *   (created_at desc), oldest (created_at asc), updated (updated_at desc),
   *   pinned first.
   *
   * Related operations:
   *
   * - Use GET /econPoliticalForum/threads/{threadId} to fetch a single thread
   *   detail including posts.
   * - Use PATCH /econPoliticalForum/threads (search) for cross-category searches;
   *   this operation is scoped to a single category by path.
   *
   * Expected errors and handling:
   *
   * - 400 Bad Request for invalid UUIDs or malformed request body
   * - 401 Unauthorized when moderator-only expanded views are requested without
   *   authentication
   * - 403 Forbidden when the caller is authenticated but not permitted to view
   *   moderator-only threads
   * - 404 Not Found if the categoryId does not exist
   * - 429 Too Many Requests when rate limits are exceeded
   * - 500 Internal Server Error for unexpected failures (include correlation id
   *   in response)
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param categoryId UUID of the target category
   *   (econ_political_forum_categories.id)
   * @param body Search, filter and pagination parameters scoped to the target
   *   category
