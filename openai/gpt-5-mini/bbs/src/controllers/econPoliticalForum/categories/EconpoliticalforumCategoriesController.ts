  /**
   * Retrieve filtered, paginated list of econ_political_forum_categories.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of categories used by
   * econPoliticalForum.
   *
   * This operation returns category summaries suitable for building category
   * navigation, moderation routing, or admin overviews. It is backed by the
   * Prisma table econ_political_forum_categories and surfaces the key fields
   * (id, code, name, slug, description, is_moderated, requires_verification,
   * order, created_at, updated_at). Clients can search by free-text (name,
   * slug, description), filter on booleans (is_moderated,
   * requires_verification), and sort by the UI order hint, creation date, or
   * name.
   *
   * Security and permissions: this endpoint is public-read by default and does
   * not require authentication for general listing. However, when the request
   * explicitly asks to include records with a non-null deleted_at
   * (archived/removed categories), that behavior is restricted to
   * administrative roles and must be requested from an authenticated admin
   * client. Implementations MUST exclude non-active records (deleted_at !=
   * null) for unauthenticated or non-admin requests.
   *
   * Relationship to database entities: This operation maps directly to the
   * econ_political_forum_categories model in the Prisma schema. It reads
   * canonical category metadata and does not modify state. The response is
   * intentionally a summary view optimized for lists; full details can be
   * retrieved with the GET /categories/{categoryId} endpoint.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: The request payload supports pagination
   * (cursor or page/limit), a free-text query for name/slug/description,
   * boolean filters for is_moderated and requires_verification, and sort
   * options (order, created_at, name). Default page size is 20 and maximum
   * allowable page size is 100. If an unauthenticated request attempts to set
   * includeDeleted=true, the server MUST return 403 Forbidden. Malformed
   * pagination parameters result in 400 Bad Request with details.
   *
   * Related operations: Use GET /categories/{categoryId} to fetch a single
   * category's full details. Use admin-only configuration endpoints to update
   * site settings that affect category behavior such as moderation thresholds.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling: On success the operation returns a
   * paginated container of category summary DTOs. Common errors include 400
   * (validation), 401 (when admin-only flags are requested without
   * authentication), 403 (forbidden admin flag usage), 429 (rate limit), and
   * 500 (internal error).

  /**
   * Retrieve a single econ_political_forum_categories record by ID.
   *
   * Get detailed category information by categoryId.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: Return a single category record used for rendering
   * category pages, editing forms, or moderation configuration inspection. The
   * record includes canonical metadata from the econ_political_forum_categories
   * table (id, code, name, slug, description, is_moderated,
   * requires_verification, order, created_at, updated_at). Public clients
   * receive active categories only; if a category has a non-null deleted_at it
   * is treated as not found for public requests.
   *
   * Security considerations and user permissions: This endpoint is generally
   * publicly readable for active categories. If an authenticated administrator
   * requests inclusion of archived/removed categories, the API may return the
   * record along with deleted_at and administrative metadata. Requests
   * attempting to view deleted records without administrative privileges should
   * receive a 404 Not Found to avoid exposing deleted items.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying database entities: The operation directly
   * exposes the econ_political_forum_categories Prisma model. Implementers
   * should be careful to honor field constraints (slug uniqueness) and to
   * verify that the category exists and is active for the requesting role.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic: The path parameter categoryId must be
   * a UUID formatted string. If the categoryId does not exist or the category
   * is excluded by visibility rules, return 404. If the categoryId format is
   * invalid, return 400 with a validation error. If the requesting client is an
   * admin and requests additional administrative fields, those can be included
   * in the returned DTO per ACL rules.
   *
   * Related operations: Use PATCH /categories to search and paginate
   * categories. Use admin update endpoints (not part of this operation set) to
   * modify category metadata.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling: On success return the full category
   * DTO. Typical errors: 400 Bad Request (invalid UUID), 401 Unauthorized (if
   * admin-only data requested without auth), 403 Forbidden (if trying to access
   * admin-only fields), 404 Not Found (no matching active category), 500
   * Internal Server Error.
