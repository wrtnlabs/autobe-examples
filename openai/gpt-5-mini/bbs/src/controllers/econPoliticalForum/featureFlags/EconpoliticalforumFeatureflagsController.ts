  /**
   * Retrieve a single feature flag by ID (EconPoliticalForum.feature_flags).
   *
   * Purpose and overview:
   *
   * Retrieve the canonical feature flag record identified by the path parameter
   * featureFlagId. This operation surfaces runtime feature configuration such
   * as the flag key, whether it is enabled, optional rollout percentages,
   * environment scoping, and the human-readable description. The underlying
   * Prisma model is econ_political_forum_feature_flags and the response maps to
   * the IEconPoliticalForumFeatureFlag DTO.
   *
   * Security considerations and permissions:
   *
   * Feature flags include an is_public boolean. Public flags (is_public = true)
   * may be read by unauthenticated clients but the server MUST redact or omit
   * the `value` field for public consumers. Non-public flags (is_public =
   * false) require elevated privileges (for example, admin or internal tooling)
   * to view and MUST be logged when accessed. The API implementation must
   * enforce these rules server-side. Clients MUST NOT use feature flag `value`
   * to carry secrets; sensitive configuration must be stored in a dedicated
   * secrets manager.
   *
   * Relationship to DB entity and validation rules:
   *
   * This operation directly queries the econ_political_forum_feature_flags
   * table. Key columns include: id (UUID), key (unique string), value (string),
   * enabled (boolean), rollout_percentage (Int|null), description
   * (string|null), environment (string|null), is_public (boolean), created_at,
   * updated_at, deleted_at (nullable soft-delete timestamp). The featureFlagId
   * path parameter must be a UUID and will be used to locate the record. If
   * deleted_at is set, behavior should follow retention rules (typically 404).
   *
   * Related operations and error handling:
   *
   * - Use GET /econPoliticalForum/featureFlags/{featureFlagId} to fetch a single
   *   flag; use an admin-only listing endpoint to enumerate non-public flags.
   * - Error responses include 400 for malformed UUIDs, 404 if no active record
   *   exists for the provided id (or the record is soft-deleted and not
   *   visible), and 403 when attempting to read a non-public flag without
   *   sufficient privileges.
   *
   * Expected behavior and edge cases:
   *
   * - If the flag exists but is_public=false and the caller lacks authorization,
   *   return 403.
   * - If the flag is found but has a null rollout_percentage, treat that as "not
   *   set" in client logic.
   * - Servers must redact `value` for public consumers and must audit any access
   *   that returns `value` to authorized callers.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param featureFlagId UUID of the target feature flag
