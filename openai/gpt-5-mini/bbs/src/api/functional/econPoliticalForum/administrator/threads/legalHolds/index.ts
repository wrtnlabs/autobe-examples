/**
 * List legal holds for a thread (administrator only).
 *
 * Purpose and overview:
 *
 * Retrieve the list of legal hold records associated with a single thread.
 * Legal holds are administrative records indicating that the referenced content
 * (thread or related posts) must be preserved and not purged due to legal or
 * investigatory requirements. This endpoint returns metadata about each hold so
 * administrators can review hold reason, scope, active window, and related case
 * identifiers.
 *
 * Security and permissions:
 *
 * This endpoint exposes sensitive information and is restricted to
 * administrative users. Only users with administrator privileges may call this
 * operation. The system must verify caller authorization before returning any
 * legal-hold records and must log access in the audit trail for compliance.
 *
 * Relationship to Prisma DB and entities:
 *
 * Results are sourced from the `econ_political_forum_legal_holds` Prisma model
 * which includes (among others) the fields: `id`, `registereduser_id` (holder),
 * `post_id`, `thread_id`, `moderation_case_id`, `hold_reason`, `hold_start`,
 * `hold_end`, `is_active`, `notes`, and `created_at`. Records returned by this
 * endpoint are those where `thread_id` equals the provided path parameter. The
 * endpoint must not attempt to infer or return fields that are not stored in
 * that table.
 *
 * Validation rules and business logic:
 *
 * - The `threadId` path parameter MUST be a valid UUID. Requests with malformed
 *   UUIDs MUST return 400 with a clear error message.
 * - Only administrator-role callers MAY access the data; unauthorized requests
 *   MUST return 403.
 * - The API supports pagination and lightweight filtering (query parameters) for
 *   `is_active` (true/false) and date-range filters on `hold_start` and/or
 *   `hold_end`. If no filters are provided, return recent holds first,
 *   paginated.
 * - This is a read-only operation and MUST NOT change
 *   `econ_political_forum_legal_holds` records or release holds.
 *
 * Related operations and usage:
 *
 * - Use GET /posts/{postId}/legalHolds to list legal holds targeted at a specific
 *   post (sibling endpoint).
 * - Administrative APIs that create, update, or release legal holds are separate
 *   secured endpoints (not part of this operation) and should emit audit log
 *   entries and, when applicable, apply legal hold flags that prevent purge
 *   flows.
 *
 * Expected behavior and error handling:
 *
 * - 200: Returns a paginated list of legal hold records matching the threadId and
 *   optional filters.
 * - 400: Invalid threadId format or invalid filter parameters.
 * - 403: Caller not authorized (requires administrator role).
 * - 404: Thread not found (if the threadId does not exist) or no holds found (200
 *   with empty data is preferred for no holds).
 * - 500: Internal server error. Implementers should log details server-side and
 *   return a generic error to clients.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.threadId Unique identifier (UUID) of the target thread whose
 *   legal holds will be listed.
