/**
 * Search and retrieve a paginated list of threads.
 *
 * Purpose and overview:
 *
 * This operation performs advanced retrieval of threads from the
 * econ_political_forum_threads table. It supports full-text title search
 * (leveraging the title trigram index), filters by category_id, author_id, tag
 * membership (via thread-tags join), status, pinned flag, and date ranges on
 * created_at/updated_at. Results are returned in a paginated container and
 * include thread summary fields optimized for list displays.
 *
 * Security considerations and user permissions:
 *
 * Public read access is allowed for standard public categories, but results
 * must respect category gating: if a category requires verification (refer to
 * econ_political_forum_categories.requires_verification) or is marked moderated
 * (econ_political_forum_categories.is_moderated), the API and implementation
 * must ensure non-verified users do not receive unpublished or pending threads.
 * For authenticated users, results can include restricted content the user is
 * authorized to view. Implement appropriate rate limits to mitigate abuse (for
 * example: create/search throttles per account/IP).
 *
 * Relationship to underlying DB entities:
 *
 * This operation directly queries econ_political_forum_threads and uses its
 * relationships to categories (category_id) and tags (via
 * econ_political_forum_thread_tags) and to author (author_id referencing
 * econ_political_forum_registereduser). The Prisma schema includes indexes for
 * title (gin_trgm_ops) enabling efficient full-text title search; the operation
 * should leverage that index for relevance ranking. Soft-deleted threads
 * (deleted_at non-null) must be excluded from public results unless the
 * requester is an administrator or the request explicitly includes archived
 * content.
 *
 * Validation rules and business logic:
 *
 * - Pagination: support cursor or page/limit patterns with sensible defaults
 *   (default page size 20, max 100).
 * - Search: title search should support partial matches and ranking; include
 *   query sanitization to avoid injection.
 * - Filters: category_id and tag_id filters must be validated as UUIDs; date
 *   range filters must be ISO 8601 timestamps.
 * - Sorting: allow sort by relevance (when a text query is present), newest
 *   (created_at desc), oldest, most-replied or pinned-first.
 * - Visibility: exclude threads in moderated categories that are pending approval
 *   from users without moderator/admin privileges.
 * - Soft-deletes: threads with deleted_at populated are hidden from normal
 *   listings.
 *
 * Related operations:
 *
 * - Use GET /threads/{threadId} to retrieve a single thread with full detail
 *   (including posts and top-level comments).
 * - Use POST/PUT operations (not included here) to create or update threads;
 *   these must populate econ_political_forum_post_revisions when edits occur.
 *
 * Expected behavior and error handling:
 *
 * - Return a paginated response with thread summary items and pagination
 *   metadata. 400 on invalid filter values, 401 for private/restricted access
 *   attempts, 429 when rate limits are exceeded, and 500 for unexpected server
 *   errors.

/**
 * Get a single thread by ID with details.
 *
 * Purpose and overview:
 *
 * This operation returns one thread record from the
 * econ_political_forum_threads table identified by the path parameter
 * {threadId}. The response provides full thread metadata needed to render the
 * thread page, including title, author reference (author_id), category
 * reference (category_id), status, pinned flag, and timestamps. Implementations
 * often include top-level posts (first page of posts) in the payload to
 * simplify client rendering.
 *
 * Security considerations and user permissions:
 *
 * The operation must enforce visibility rules: do not return threads that are
 * soft-deleted (deleted_at set) except to administrators or authorized
 * moderators. For categories that require verification (see
 * econ_political_forum_categories.requires_verification) or are moderated
 * (econ_political_forum_categories.is_moderated), ensure the caller has
 * appropriate privileges before returning pending or private items. If the
 * thread is pending moderator approval, return 403 for unauthorized users or
 * 404 to avoid revealing existence when policy requires non-disclosure.
 *
 * Relationship to underlying database entities:
 *
 * This operation uses the econ_political_forum_threads table and joins as
 * needed to author (econ_political_forum_registereduser) and to posts
 * (econ_political_forum_posts) for an optional embedded posts list. The Prisma
 * schema provides trigram indexes on title for search; this endpoint is a
 * point-retrieval and should be served from primary keyed lookup by id (UUID)
 * for best performance.
 *
 * Validation rules and business logic:
 *
 * - Path parameter threadId must be a UUID matching
 *   econ_political_forum_threads.id.
 * - If include parameters request embedding posts or other relations, enforce
 *   pagination for posts, and exclude hidden posts (is_hidden true) from public
 *   responses unless the requester is moderator/admin.
 * - If the thread is soft-deleted (deleted_at not null) and the caller is not
 *   privileged, return 404.
 *
 * Related operations and error handling:
 *
 * - Use PATCH /threads for list/search and GET /threads/{threadId}/posts (or
 *   embedded posts) to fetch paginated posts. 400 for malformed UUIDs, 401 for
 *   authentication required when requesting restricted content, 403 for
 *   unauthorized access to pending/moderated content, 404 if not found or
 *   soft-deleted for public user, 500 for unexpected errors.
