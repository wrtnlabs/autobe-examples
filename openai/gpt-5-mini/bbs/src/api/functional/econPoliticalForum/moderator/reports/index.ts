/**
 * Retrieve filtered, paginated list of moderation reports (moderator/admin).
 *
 * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of moderation reports from the
 * `econ_political_forum_reports` table. This operation is intended for
 * moderators and administrators to triage incoming reports. It supports complex
 * search criteria including full-text search on reporter_text, filters by
 * status and priority, filtering by reported_post_id or reported_thread_id,
 * date ranges (created_at, triaged_at), reporter anonymity filter, and
 * assignment to moderation cases.
 *
 * Security and permissions: Only authenticated moderator or administrator roles
 * should access this endpoint. The service MUST ensure reporter anonymity is
 * honored: when reporter_anonymous is true, reporter identifying fields SHALL
 * be omitted or redacted in responses to non-admin consumers. Pagination
 * results SHOULD be limited for UI performance and rate-limited for safety.
 *
 * Relationship to DB entities: This operation reads the
 * `econ_political_forum_reports` model and may join to related tables (posts,
 * threads, moderation_cases, registereduser) for display purposes. The response
 * SHOULD not expose internal-only fields like internal audit references unless
 * the caller is an administrator.
 *
 * Validation and business rules: Request payload must validate pagination
 * parameters (page/limit or cursor), allowed sort fields (created_at, priority,
 * status), and search string lengths. The backend SHOULD enforce maximum page
 * size and rate limits per user role.
 *
 * Related operations: Use `GET /reports/{reportId}` to retrieve full details
 * for a single report and use moderator endpoints to take actions (dismiss,
 * escalate) on individual reports.
 *
 * Error handling: On validation errors return 400; unauthorized access returns
 * 401/403; rate limiting returns 429; unexpected server errors return 500.

 * Update a report (moderator-only triage and actions).

 *
 * Purpose and overview: Used by moderators to acknowledge, triage, escalate, or
 * resolve user reports. Updates mutable processing fields on the
 * econ_political_forum_reports record and triggers server-side side effects
 * required by moderation policy (create moderation_case, moderation_log and
 * audit entries where applicable).
 *
 * Security and permissions: Only users with moderator privileges may call this
 * endpoint. The server must authenticate the caller as a moderator and set
 * moderator_id server-side. Admin-only final actions may require additional
 * checks.
 *
 * Relationship to the database: Updates fields on econ_political_forum_reports
 * (status, priority, triaged_at, reviewed_at, resolved_at, moderation_case_id,
 * deleted_at) that exist in the Prisma schema. The server must also generate
 * corresponding entries in econ_political_forum_moderation_logs and
 * econ_political_forum_audit_logs to satisfy audit requirements.
 *
 * Validation and business logic: Validate provided status and priority values.
 * For transitions to action_taken or escalated, create moderation_log entries
 * with rationale and evidence_reference and set reviewed_at/resolved_at as
 * appropriate. Implement optimistic concurrency handling (e.g., require client
 * to include last-known updated_at) and return 409 Conflict when concurrent
