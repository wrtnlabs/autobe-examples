/// Authentication and identity table for all application users. Holds

/// uniquely identified by email and manages its own password. Deletion or
/// modification of user accounts is audited via timestamps. Email uniqueness
/// enforces single identity. No advanced roles exist; this is the only actor
/// type in the system. No PII beyond minimal required for authentication is
/// stored. This table does not directly reference any business data tables,
/// but is referenced by them for ownership.
