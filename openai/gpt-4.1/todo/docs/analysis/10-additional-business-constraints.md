# Additional Business Constraints and Assumptions for Minimal Todo List Application

## Assumptions
- THE application SHALL operate exclusively with a single authenticated user role ("user"), who is limited to managing only their own Todos, reflecting a personal-use scenario.
- THE application SHALL provide only the essential features necessary for managing a Todo list: create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) Todo items for the authenticated user. No extra functionalities or options are included by default.
- THE system ASSUMES all users are individuals; shared Todos, group functions, or any team/collaborative features are explicitly out of scope.
- THE backend SHALL serve solely as a minimal API persistence layer. No frontend, notification systems, or advanced automation logic are assumed or implied by the business requirements.
- THE environment presupposes a modern, publicly accessible RESTful API over HTTPS, but there is no commitment to mobile, offline-first, or desktop-specific functionality.

## Compliance Requirements
- WHERE user data is stored, THE system SHALL limit all personal data collection to what is strictly necessary for account authentication and Todo management (typically: username, email, password hash). No additional PII SHALL be collected without explicit future business justification.
- IF privacy laws such as GDPR or local regulations apply, THEN THE system SHALL enable each user to permanently delete their account as well as all related Todo data, upon authenticated request, with no retention of deleted content.
- THE system SHALL support basic export of a user's Todo items as plain text or CSV, to the extent necessary to comply with minimal data portability obligations or reasonable user demand.
- THE application SHALL avoid tracking, logging, or storing of any non-essential metadata related to user actions, Todo item locations, or device information.
- WHERE heightened compliance requirements arise, THE development team SHALL treat this section as the primary location to document any new business-driven mandates regarding data retention, data subject rights, or audit operations.

## Potential Extensions (Minimal)
- THE business MAY someday support marking multiple Todos as complete in a single operation, provided this does not violate the "minimal" scope principle.
- WHERE justified by clear user feedback or business need, THE system MAY permit basic sorting or filtering (e.g., by completion status), but only if it remains within the boundaries of minimal functionality.
- WHERE limited user personalization (e.g., dark/light mode preference) is justified, THE system SHALL store only the absolute minimal data needed to deliver the feature.
- WHERE integration with third-party tools or calendar systems is ever proposed, THE business SHALL require proper documented rationale and limit any such feature to exporting a user's Todos in a standard format (plain text or CSV).
- CHANGES to requirements in this section SHALL require explicit business case documentation in order to preserve the minimal, reliable scope of the Todo application.
