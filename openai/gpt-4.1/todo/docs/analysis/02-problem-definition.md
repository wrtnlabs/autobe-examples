# Problem Definition for Minimal Todo List Application

## User Pain Points
- Many individuals struggle daily to organize, remember, and keep track of tasks—both personal and professional. WHEN a user relies on memory alone or scattered notes (physical or digital), THE likelihood of missed tasks, forgotten deadlines, or duplicated efforts SHALL increase.
- Existing digital solutions often present too many features, resulting in decision fatigue, confusion, or a time-consuming setup before the user can begin tracking tasks.
- WHEN users attempt to use overcomplicated task management apps for simple lists, THE system SHALL cause frustration by forcing unnecessary categorization, prioritization, or context selection.
- IF a user wishes only to record a task and mark it complete, THEN many current solutions SHALL create barriers by requiring additional fields or navigation through menus.
- For users seeking minimal distractions, any requirement to configure, learn, or ignore irrelevant features reduces engagement and persistence in using the tool. THE system SHALL provide an experience that addresses this minimalism.

## Market Needs
- The primary market segment addressed is users who require only basic Todo list functions: capturing, viewing, marking as done, and removing tasks, with no advanced options.
- These users need quick access from any device and expect data to persist reliably between sessions, regardless of where they start or pick up their work.
- Security is a concern, as each user's Todo list may include private or personal content. THE system SHALL protect access to personal Todos by ensuring only authenticated users can manage their own lists.
- Users express a need for zero-friction onboarding; minimal registration and account management are essential to ensure quick adoption and immediate productivity.
- Performance expectation: THE system SHALL allow users to add, edit, view, or delete tasks instantly (sub-second perceived delay for core actions).

## Existing Solutions and Gaps
- Although many digital Todo list applications exist (including well-known productivity and note apps), most target users seeking complex workflows, integrations, or advanced prioritization.
- WHEN a user seeks a truly minimal application, THE market mostly offers pen-and-paper solutions or repurposes other apps, both of which lack digital persistence, backup, and cross-device syncing.
- Existing "simple" solutions often still require extensive onboarding, default priority, due date, label settings, or push non-essential options into the primary workflow, violating the "minimal effort, maximum utility" requirement for this audience.
- There is presently a gap for an application that serves only the most stripped-down user need: authenticated access, minimal input (just the task itself), and instant feedback on every action, with no optional features.

## Key Challenges
- The core challenge is constructing a system that, WHILE remaining minimal, SHALL ensure reliability and data integrity—no user should ever lose or fail to update their Todo list, regardless of device or network interruptions.
- Adoption and sustained usage depend on initial and ongoing absence of obstacles: registration/log-in must not be a burden, and user flows must remain frictionless (from first launch to repeated daily use).
- It is critical to avoid any feature creep; mistakenly adding "helpful" options risks undermining the product’s core value—simplicity.
- Performance benchmark: THE system SHALL return all lists and process all task edits in perceived real time, to keep pace with quick user expectations (action results visible within 1 second in normal network conditions).
- Privacy and security are paramount, even with limited user data; THE system SHALL enforce access barriers so that no user can ever read or modify another's tasks.
