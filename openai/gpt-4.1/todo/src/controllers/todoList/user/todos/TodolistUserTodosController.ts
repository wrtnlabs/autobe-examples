   * Create a new Todo item owned by the authenticated user (todo_list_todos

   * Allows an authenticated user to create a new Todo item to track a personal
   * task. The title is required and must be meaningful, ranging from 1 to 100
   * characters; a description is optional but, if provided, cannot exceed 500
   * characters. When a Todo is created, the system sets the completion status
   * to false and fills in current "created_at" and "updated_at" timestamps. The
   * created Todo is associated with the requesting user for future ownership
   * validation.
   *
   * Security checks require the user to be authenticated. The system uses the
   * active user session for ownership linkage (todo_list_user_id). The backend
   * enforces data validation as per the schema: empty or whitespace-only titles
   * or overlength fields are not permitted. Description is optional but must
   * respect the character limit when supplied.
   *
   * All fields not present in the Prisma schema (such as deleted_at,
   * restored_at, etc.) are intentionally excluded; only the essential minimal
   * fields (title, description, created_at, user-owned) are included. In case
   * of validation failures or attempted creation without proper authentication,
   * the system returns an error response without exposing internal details.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Information for creating a new Todo item, including title
   *   (mandatory), optional description (up to 500 chars); completion is set to
   *   false by default; all other fields default to system.

   * Search and retrieve a paginated list of the authenticated user's Todo

   *
   * This operation enables an authenticated user to retrieve a filtered and
   * paginated list of their Todo items from the system. The API allows
   * searching by completion status (completed/incomplete/all), keyword
   * filtering on the title and description, and supports ordering by creation
   * date in descending order by default. The business logic strictly ensures
   * that only Todos owned by the current user are included in the result, even
   * if additional filter parameters are provided.
   *
   * Pagination parameters such as page number and size control the volume of
   * results returned. Search and filtering operate only within the
   * authenticated user's dataset; attempts to access other users' Todos are
   * blocked at the business logic layer. The response contains summary details
   * for each Todo, including its id, title, description (if any), completed
   * status, and timestamps for creation, last update, and completed time where
   * relevant.
   *
   * Security is enforced by requiring a valid user token, and all business
   * logic prevents enumeration or disclosure of other users' data. Error
   * scenarios include authentication failure (session/token missing or
   * expired), invalid pagination/filter parameters, and unexpected server
   * errors.
   *
   * Clients should use this endpoint to present Todo lists, filtered views, or
   * search within the user's own tasks. Deeper details can be retrieved using
   * the single-Todo endpoint if required.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria including optional completion status, text
   *   keyword, and pagination options for filtering the user's Todos.

   * present all attributes of a selected Todo, including id, title, optional

   * (without confirming the existence of others' Todos). This ensures privacy
   * and data isolation in line with both business rules and security best
   * practices. No modification occurs with this request. All fields correspond
   * exactly to the todo_list_todos Prisma table definition, assuring that code
   * and documentation stay in sync.

   * of a Todo, such as on a detail page or before editing. Error handling
   * includes authentication failure, nonexistent or non-owned resource, and

   * item that they own. The user provides a new title (mandatory, 1-100 chars),
   * an optional description (up to 500 chars), and/or a new completion status
   * (boolean). The request is only validated and performed if the Todo exists
   * and belongs to the requesting user. Upon successful update, the updated_at

   * completed_at timestamp) is modified according to the change.
   *
   * All inputs are strictly validated: title cannot be empty or exceed the
