/**
 * Validate that admin can delete a product image, and image deletion logic is
 * enforced for business rules.
 *
 * Business context: Products must have at least one image; deleting the primary
 * image should trigger fallback, catalog updates should reflect image changes,
 * and deletion of the last image should be prevented.
 *
 * Workflow:
 *
 * 1. Register and authenticate as an admin
 * 2. Create a category for a product
 * 3. Create a product assigned to that category
 * 4. Upload 2 images to the product (first is primary)
 * 5. Delete the second image successfully, ensure primary (main_image_url) remains
 *    unchanged
 * 6. Attempt to delete the primary image; ensure API allows deletion, triggers
 *    fallback to the other image as main_image_url
 * 7. Confirm the product's main_image_url updates to the remaining image
 * 8. Attempt to delete the last (remaining) image, expect an error (cannot remove
 *    sole image)
