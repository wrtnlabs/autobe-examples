 * value from a product option, and that business constraints are properly
 * enforced.
 *
 * 1. Register a new admin account
 * 2. Create a new category
 * 3. Create a new product (using the above category, admin as seller)
 * 4. Create a product option (e.g., 'Color') for the product
 * 5. Create a product option value (e.g., 'Red') for the above option (target of
 *    deletion)
 * 6. Attempt to delete the option value (should succeed since it's not in use)
 * 7. Assert that deletion is successful (no error thrown)
 * 8. (Optional/extension) Attempt to delete a value known to be in use (if the
 *    test API/resource allowed setup); assert that deletion is rejected with an
 *    error.
 * 9. All steps include typia.assert for created objects and descriptive
 *    assertions.
