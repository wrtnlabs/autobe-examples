   * Search and list paginated orders with advanced filters

   *
   * This endpoint provides a filtered, paginated list of orders in the shopping
   * mall platform. The operation queries the shopping_mall_orders entity, which
   * is the core table for storing order information including links to the
   * customer, optional seller reference (for split-orders), payment and
   * shipping addresses, and order items.
   *
   * The search supports advanced filtering (by order status, placed date,
   * customer or seller, order number, payment state), multi-field sorting, and
   * pagination for efficient access to potentially large datasets. Admin users
   * can access all orders; sellers may only access orders relevant to their
   * products. The structure of each result includes summary-level information:
   * order number, current status, order total, timestamp fields, main customer
   * reference, and, optionally, payment status/fulfillment data. This endpoint
   * also supports searching by keyword and filter combinations as defined in
   * the business requirement.
   *
   * Security is enforced by role constraints: admins have platform-wide access,
   * while sellers are strictly limited to their own orders. Customer-facing
   * order history may use a different, customer-restricted endpoint. Error
   * handling includes filters for non-existing search combinations and
   * validation of pagination parameters. This operation does not return full
   * order details; for that, the order detail endpoint should be used.

  /**
   * Update an existing orderâ€™s details in the shoppingMall_orders table.
   *
   * This API operation permits the modification of a placed order's details
   * within the shoppingMall_orders entity. The purpose is to enable key actors
   * (customer, seller, admin) to update an order based on workflow stage and
   * permissions.
   *
   * Customers may request updates to shipping address, contact details, or
   * cancel orders that are still pending or processing. Sellers may update
   * shipping status, input shipment tracking numbers, or add operational
   * comments if the order is in the fulfillment stage. Admins retain global
   * rights to override any field in exceptional scenarios (e.g., fraud, user
   * disputes, compliance).
   *
   * Security is strictly enforced via role-based authentication and order
   * ownership checks. Path parameter validation is required to ensure only the
   * intended order is modified. Attempting to update a finalized, cancelled, or
   * delivered order as a non-admin returns a validation error. All updates
   * trigger entry in the shopping_mall_admin_action_logs table for
   * traceability.
   *
   * Business logic includes validation of eligibility for each update request
   * type: shipping address modification is only permitted before shipment,
   * status transitions follow defined state machines, and pricing/payment
   * changes are only processed by admin.
   *
   * This operation integrates with related schemas, including
   * shopping_mall_order_addresses (address snapshot),
   * shopping_mall_order_status_history (order audit), and
   * shopping_mall_admin_action_logs (event tracking). Error handling covers
   * invalid state transitions, unauthorized access, and data integrity issues.
   * Commonly related operations include placing new orders, viewing order
   * status/history, and handling order cancellation/refunds.

  /**
   * Soft delete an order record in shoppingMall_orders via admin, marking it as
   * deleted for regulatory retention.
   *
   * This API operation enables the logical deletion (soft delete) of an order
   * record. When invoked, it sets the 'deleted_at' timestamp of a specific
   * order in the shoppingMall_orders entity, thus preventing permanent data
   * removal but ensuring the order does not appear in standard query results or
   * user order histories.
   *
   * Only administrative users are authorized to perform this action, allowing
   * them to enforce business policies around order voiding, regulatory
   * compliance, or cleanup of test/sandbox orders. This process supports
   * platform requirements to retain full order and audit data for legal minimum
   * retention periods.
   *
   * Security is enforced strictly via admin-only access. The operation checks
   * the order's current status to ensure deletion is allowed (e.g., completed,
   * refunded, or cancelled states depending on policy). All soft deletes
   * generate an event in shopping_mall_admin_action_logs for traceability and
   * audit.
   *
   * Error handling covers attempts to delete non-existent, non-eligible, or
   * already deleted orders, returning clear status and reason. Related
   * operations include viewing order details, updating order state, and
   * restoring/deleted order records via admin tools if needed.
