   * Retrieve a paginated and filterable list of escalation cases (disputes,
   * escalated customer service) from the shopping mall platform.
   *
   * This endpoint provides a comprehensive, filtered, and paginated list of
   * escalation cases present in the shopping mall system. Escalations represent
   * customer, seller, or admin-raised service requests that could not be
   * resolved through regular workflows (e.g., disputes, complaints, major
   * refunds, investigation cases). Escalations may include information on the
   * order, actors involved, escalation type and status, and assigned admin.
   *
   * Access to this endpoint is typically restricted to admin users and
   * authorized customer service agents as it may contain sensitive case and
   * account information. Permissions must be enforced in business logic to
   * restrict access to escalation cases relevant to the requesting user's role
   * or scope.
   *
   * Each escalation in the result includes meta-information like creation
   * timestamp, status, type, current handler, and optionally linked events. The
   * query supports filters on type, status, assigned admin, date range, and
   * keyword search. The paginated response ensures scalable handling even as
   * the number of open/closed cases grows.
   *
   * Related endpoints include single escalation detail loading (GET
   * /escalations/{escalationId}), status/action change APIs, and escalation
   * creation through customer/seller dispute flows. Error cases handled include
   * excessive page size, invalid search terms, or unauthorized access.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Request body for filtering, searching, and paginating
   *   escalation cases. Supports filters on type, status, assigned admin,
   *   initiator, date range, and keyword search.

   * This endpoint loads the detailed information for a specific
   * escalation/dispute case given its unique escalationId. Escalations
   * represent complex customer service or complaint situations (such as
   * refunds, disputes, or major delivery issues) that require manual handling
   * by admin or customer service staff. The response includes case state, type,
   * related order and actors, audit trail fields, status, escalation

   *
   * Authorization is required and typically limited to admin users or
   * designated customer service staff, as escalation cases may contain
   * sensitive or private information regarding users, orders, and disputes. The
   * endpoint will validate that the requesting user is authorized to view
   * escalation details, returning a not-found or unauthorized error otherwise.
   *
   * This operation references the 'shopping_mall_escalations' table and draws
   * from its relationships with orders, customers, sellers, and admins to
   * present a complete view of the given escalation. Use cases include
   * escalation handling, resolution processes, audit, and customer history
   * investigation. Error scenarios include non-existent, deleted, or

   * Update the properties of an existing escalation record, such as its status,

   * initiator (customer or seller) or an assigned admin—may perform updates to
   * an escalation. Typical updates include status transitions (e.g.,

   * assigning the case to a specific admin.
   *
   * The endpoint strictly checks access permissions: customers can only update
   * their own escalations, sellers for their orders, and admins for any case.
   * Updates are tracked with audit logs, including who made the change, the
   * prior and new status, and timestamps for compliance and traceability.
   * Validation ensures status transitions are legal (e.g., cannot resolve a
   * closed case, must provide a resolution reason when closing, etc.) and that
   * escalation content remains consistent with business rules.
   *
   * This operation interacts with the shopping_mall_escalations record
   * identified by escalationId. Potential errors are returned on unauthorized
   * updates, invalid status transitions, or missing required fields in the
   * update request. Related flows include dashboard visibility of escalation
   * status for customers, sellers, and admins; customer service event tracking;
   * and downstream effects such as notifications or associated appeals.
