   * Create a new payment method snapshot for an order

   *
   * This API operation creates a new snapshot of an order payment method for
   * recording and auditing transactional payments. Payment method snapshots are
   * required to be created for each order at checkout to store relevant data as
   * it was at the time of purchase.
   *
   * The snapshot includes the type of payment method (e.g., card,
   * bank_transfer, PayPal), method data required for reconciliation, and a
   * display name suitable for UI display or customer receipt. This operation
   * does not create or update actual third-party payment tokens; it simply
   * records a static snapshot in the database for compliance, auditing, and for
   * use in later order and payment history queries.
   *
   * This operation references the shopping_mall_order_payment_methods table,
   * ensuring all required fields (payment_method_type, method_data,
   * display_name) are provided and validated. Only administrators and internal
   * platform components are allowed to call this endpoint directly, as
   * customers and sellers typically interact with payment methods through
   * guided UI flows during checkout. Error handling includes validation of
   * required fields and compliance with method-specific data formats. This
   * operation may be paired with order/payment creation APIs for a complete
   * order processing flow.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Information to capture a payment method snapshot for an order,
   *   including type, method data, and display name.

   * enumeration of credentials and is strictly for metadata review or
   * troubleshooting.
