   * This endpoint permits authorized sellers or admins to post a reply to a
   * customer review on their product. On submission, the reply is validated for
   * maximum body length, normative status values (public/hidden), and ownership
   * by the acting seller or admin. Only one reply per review per responder is
   * permitted, preventing duplicate entries as enforced by schema constraints.
   *
   * The operation requires the review being replied to exist for the specified
   * product, enforcing referential integrity and protecting against orphaned
   * reply records. If the acting user does not have permission to reply (e.g.,
   * not the seller/admin of the product), access is denied. The reply status
   * determines its initial visibility to usersâ€”'public' for customer-visible
   * replies, 'hidden' for internal/admin-only replies.
   *
   * Business logic includes notification triggers for the original review
   * author upon reply, and audit logging for moderation. Error handling
   * provides actionable error codes/messages for permission, validation, or
   * referential integrity failures.

   * @param connection
   * @param productId Unique identifier of the product associated with the

   * in the shopping_mall_review_replies table, linking to the parent review by
   * reviewId and productId. Replies can be authored by either a seller or an

   * Access should be restricted to administrators or moderators with permission
   * to manage review replies. Business logic should enforce that only replies
   * for the specific reviewId of the product are returned, and error handling
   * addresses both missing and invalid references. This operation is often
