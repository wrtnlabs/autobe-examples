   * Retrieve all addresses for a specific seller from

   * the shopping_mall_seller_addresses table, such as recipient_name, phone,
   * region, postal_code, address lines, type (business/shipping/return), and
   * is_primary flag. Filtering, sorting, search, and pagination parameters may
   * be accepted via request body for large address books, though typical usage
   * would return a manageable number of address entries per seller.
   *
   * This operation can be accessed by the seller themselves, for use in the
   * seller dashboard, or by admins managing seller information for compliance
   * or operational support. The endpoint validates that the caller has the
   * necessary permissionsâ€”seller (must be their own addresses) or admin
   * (platform-wide view). Address details may be masked or redacted for other
   * roles as per platform privacy rules. The business logic supports real-time
   * reflection of updates, and changes to these addresses are propagated across
   * the shipping and order fulfillment modules as referenced in the
   * shopping_mall_orders entity.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict authorization matching sellerId to
   * authenticated identity (unless admin), granular control of address updates,
   * and audit logging for all accesses to ensure GDPR and business policy
   * compliance.

   * @param connection
   * @param sellerId Unique identifier of the target seller whose addresses are

   * table, which stores all addresses that a seller may use for business,
   * shipping, or returns. Only the seller associated with the addressId is
