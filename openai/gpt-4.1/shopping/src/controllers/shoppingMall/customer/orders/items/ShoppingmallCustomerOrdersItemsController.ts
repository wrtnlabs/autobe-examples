   * Retrieve and filter the list of items for a specific order from

   * Retrieve a detailed list of all itemized SKUs included in a specific order.
   * This includes information such as item name, SKU code, quantity, unit
   * price, total price, currency, and item-specific refund or cancellation
   * statuses.
   *
   * The endpoint supports filtering and pagination to efficiently review orders
   * with many line items. Sensitive fields and access are scoped according to
   * user roles: customers can view their own orders, sellers can view items
   * from orders they are responsible for, and admins can view all items.
   * Security checks enforce access control to ensure only authorized users
   * access the order's item details.
   *
   * Built upon the shopping_mall_order_items table, joined to
   * shopping_mall_orders for permission enforcement, this operation enables
   * robust audit and accountability for inventory, fulfillment, returns, and
   * analytics across roles. Validation ensures the order exists and the user
   * role is permitted to view items for this order, and errors are returned if
   * the order is invalid or access is denied.
   *
   * This operation is commonly paired with order detail retrieval, item-level
   * refund initiation endpoints, and shipment tracking features for
   * high-fidelity order monitoring by both buyers and sellers.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param orderId Unique identifier of the order whose items will be listed.
   * @param body Request parameters for filtering and paginating the list of
   *   items within the specified order.

  /**

   *
   * Delete an item from a specific order using its unique order ID and item ID.
   * This operation targets the shopping_mall_order_items table and ensures that
   * only items actually included in the given order may be removed, complying
   * with all referential and business integrity rules. The main use cases
   * include customer-requested cancellations prior to shipment, administrative
   * corrections, or seller-directed modifications before fulfillment.
   *
   * Authorization is strictly enforced: customers can only modify their own
   * orders and only under certain states (e.g., pending, processing). Sellers
   * can act on their own products before shipment, and admins have full
   * override capability in accordance with business policies. Each attempted
   * deletion checks item/order status for eligibility, blocks removal if the
   * item is already shipped, delivered, refunded, or under dispute, and
   * provides a suitable error if the operation cannot proceed.
   *
   * Related updates such as refund of reserved funds, adjustment of inventory,
   * and timeline notifications are triggered as per business rules. This
   * operation links to core flows documented in order management, cancellation,
   * refund, and customer service requirements, and should be coordinated with
   * those API calls where intricate business processes are involved.
   *
   * Error cases are handled with explicit status returns, such as 'not found',
   * 'unauthorized', 'item not removable', or 'order ineligible for
   * modification'.
