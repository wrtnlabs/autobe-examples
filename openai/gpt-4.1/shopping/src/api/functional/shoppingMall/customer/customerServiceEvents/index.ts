/**
 * Retrieve a customer service event's details by eventId
 * (shopping_mall_customer_service_events table).
 *
 * This API retrieves a customer service event identified by its unique eventId
 * from the shopping_mall_customer_service_events table. The customer service
 * event logs actions performed by customers, sellers, admins, or the system for
 * order service cases, escalations, or appeals. The log captures the associated
 * order history, escalation, or appeal context, as well as all relevant actor
 * information (customer, seller, admin).
 *
 * Access control is vital: customers may only retrieve events they are directly
 * involved in, sellers may only see events tied to orders/products they are
 * responsible for, and admins can view all cases for oversight or investigation
 * purposes. Sensitive/comment fields require masking or omission for users
 * lacking appropriate permissions.
 *
 * This retrieval operation is critical for customer support timelines, audit
 * trails, and case histories. Error handling includes returning not found for
 * nonexistent IDs, or forbidden for unauthorized access. Related endpoints
 * include searching service events by order or filtering logs by context.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.eventId Unique identifier of the target customer service event
 *   record (UUID format).

/**
 * Update details of a customer service event record by eventId
 * (shopping_mall_customer_service_events table).
 *
 * This API allows updating certain allowed fields of an existing customer
 * service event record identified by eventId. The
 * shopping_mall_customer_service_events table provides an audit trail of
 * customer service actions spanning case escalation, investigation, messaging,
 * admin resolution, or appeal. Permitted fields to update may include
 * event_status, event_comment, or actor assignment but never audit or
 * created_at details.
 *
 * Authorization is strictly enforced: typically only admins or specifically
 * assigned actors to the event (e.g., as part of an escalation case) can change
 * status, annotate, or append a comment. Attempts to update fields outside of
 * permission scope or immutable fields (created_at, actor references, order
 * linkage) will be rejected with validation or forbidden errors.
 *
 * The operation incorporates business logic to ensure customer service process
 * integrity, supporting only those field changes reflecting real workflow steps
 * (e.g., review, resolution, annotation), and rigorously logs each update for
 * audit compliance. Related APIs include retrieving event details, listing all
 * events per escalation/appeal, or escalating to admin for further review.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.eventId Unique identifier of the customer service event to
 *   update (UUID format).
 * @param props.body Modifiable fields for updating customer service event
 *   (event_status, event_comment, etc.) in accordance with assigned roles and
 *   business workflow.
