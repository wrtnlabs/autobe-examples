 * Create a new wishlist for the authenticated customer. Each customer may have

 *
 * The operation inserts a new record in shopping_mall_wishlists and associates
 * it with the customer's unique ID. Required properties include
 * shopping_mall_customer_id (owner), timestamps, and any initial configuration
 * (all per the Prisma schema). Business rules ensure that only customers may
 * create wishlists for themselves; attempts to create multiple wishlists or
 * unauthorized creation should return an error.
 *
 * This operation integrates with the user onboarding and product-browsing flows
 * and is the entry point for customers to start saving products. Error handling
 * must include validation for already-existing wishlists (per-customer),
 * missing authentication, or invalid user role. The response returns the newly
 * created wishlist with its properties.

 * are excluded from the result, ensuring only active products appear.

 * (e.g., length limits for names, or uniqueness for certain list properties).
 * The updated_at timestamp is refreshed upon successful operation.

 * The operation is expected to fail if the wishlist does not exist, is soft

/**
 * Soft delete a customer's wishlist in the shopping_mall_wishlists table by

 *
 * This endpoint marks a customer’s wishlist as deleted by updating the
 * deleted_at field with the current timestamp (soft delete). It operates on the
 * shopping_mall_wishlists table, which maintains wishlists for each customer
 * and supports soft deletion for audit, recovery, and compliance reasons.
 *
 * Security-wise, only the owner (authenticated customer) or an admin can
 * perform this operation, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot remove
 * wishlists belonging to others. Once soft deleted, the wishlist is flagged as
 * such and becomes inaccessible to user APIs.
 *
 * The business logic ensures that all references to the wishlist are maintained
 * for audit, but the resource is removed from user-facing displays and future
 * CRUD access. Attempting to delete a wishlist that does not exist, is already
 * deleted, or is not owned by the requester produces a relevant error.
 *
 * This operation is typically used in account cleanup, privacy flows, or
