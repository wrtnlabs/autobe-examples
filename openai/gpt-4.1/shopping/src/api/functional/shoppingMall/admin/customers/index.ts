 *
 * Retrieve a paginated, filterable list of all registered customers on the
 * platform. This operation supports advanced search use-cases, including
 * filtering by registration date, status (active, suspended,
 * pending_verification), name, and email. Designed for admin dashboard usage,
 * it provides UI-ready pagination, sorting, and search fields.
 *
 * The Prisma shopping_mall_customers table provides the data model, including
 * profile fields, email verification state, and account activity status.
 * Response records allow navigation to customer detail, order summaries, and
 * address management. Query complexity accommodates both bulk admin operations
 * and contextual search (e.g., find all new users for the last 30 days).
 *
 * Security wise, only users with admin privileges can access this endpoint to
 * ensure customer personal data (email, phone, full_name, status) privacy. The
 * system enforces strict access control and logs queries performed. This
 * endpoint is intended to be paired with single-customer detail, create,
 * update, or erase operations for full admin management coverage.

/**
 * Hard delete a shopping mall customer account (shopping_mall_customers table)
 * by customerId.
 *
 * Permanently erase a shopping mall customer account based on the provided
 * customerId. This API operation is typically used by administrative actors to
 * enforce compliance, policy violations, GDPR/account erasure requests, or
 * permanent account withdrawal. The operation targets the
 * shopping_mall_customers table, referencing the id primary key column defined
 * in the Prisma schema.
 *
 * All related records that reference this customer, such as addresses
 * (shopping_mall_customer_addresses), carts (shopping_mall_carts), wishlists,
 * orders, and reviews, are subject to cascading deletion or orphan retention
 * according to the Prisma relations and ON DELETE behavior. This hard delete
 * operation sets the deleted_at column for audit but also physically removes
 * data where compliance or security requires complete erasure.
 *
 * Security is criticalâ€”this erase operation is restricted to admin users.
 * Authorization via JWT with role validation is mandatory. The operation
 * validates that the customerId is well-formed, exists, and has no dependent
 * compliance holds before proceeding. In cases where the customer cannot be
 * deleted due to unresolved orders, refunds, or legal holds, an error
 * describing the blocking condition is returned.
 *
 * This operation is related to the creation, updating, and retrieval APIs for
 * customer data, forming the DELETE operation in the REST lifecycle. It must be
 * used with caution and is logged in system audit tables for compliance and
 * traceability. This operation does not implement a soft-delete pattern but
 * will set deleted_at for audit/tombstone if present in schema.
