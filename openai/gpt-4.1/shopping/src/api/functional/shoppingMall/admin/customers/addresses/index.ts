/**
 * Fetch a paginated list of addresses for a given customerId in
 * shopping_mall_customer_addresses.
 *
 * Retrieve a paginated and optionally filtered list of all addresses registered
 * by a specified customer. The API operates on the
 * shopping_mall_customer_addresses table, using customer_id as the foreign key
 * to retrieve addresses belonging to a single customer. All relevant address
 * fields—recipient_name, phone, region, postal_code, address lines, is_default,
 * and timestamps—are included per the Prisma column definitions.
 *
 * Customers must be authenticated to fetch their own address book;
 * authorization is enforced on customerId to ensure ownership. Advanced
 * features support filtering by region, postal_code, or searching for partial
 * address text, as well as sorting by created_at, updated_at, or is_default
 * flag.
 *
 * This endpoint is typically used in the account dashboard for browsing or
 * managing shipping information, as well as in checkout workflows for selecting
 * or updating delivery addresses. Security checks ensure that the requesting
 * token's user matches the customerId path parameter, or else admin override is
 * required. All data is returned in paginated form to support users with many
 * addresses.
 *
 * This operation is related to address creation, update, and deletion
 * endpoints, and is a primary part of customer self-service interfaces. Errors
 * are returned if customerId is not found or the user is not authorized to view
 * specified addresses.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.customerId Unique identifier of the customer whose addresses
 *   should be fetched (UUID).
 * @param props.body Request body to specify search, filtering, sorting, and
 *   pagination options for fetching address list.

/**
 * Soft-delete a customer's address (shopping_mall_customer_addresses table)
 * with authorization and ownership checks.
 *
 * This operation provides a mechanism for customers to manage their own address
 * book by removing an address entry. When the customer requests to delete an
 * address, the system will verify that the address exists and is owned by the
 * currently authenticated user. Only the address owner or administrators are
 * permitted to invoke this operation, ensuring that private address data is
 * secured against unauthorized deletion.
 *
 * Upon successful validation, the address is permanently removed from the
 * shopping_mall_customer_addresses table. Since the column 'deleted_at' exists,
 * this operation should perform a soft delete, marking the deleted_at timestamp
 * instead of physically removing the row, in order to preserve deletion history
 * for audit trails. Any attempt to delete an address that does not belong to
 * the user should trigger a forbidden error.
 *
 * The system must check for business logic such as whether the address is
 * currently associated with pending orders or if it was the only or default
 * address on file. Appropriate validation or error handling must communicate to
 * the user if the address cannot be deleted due to these business constraints.
 * Related APIs for managing addresses (add, update, set as default) should be
 * referenced for complete address management flows.
 *
 * Error handling covers edge cases such as trying to delete non-existent
 * addresses, deleting another user's address, or attempting to remove the only
 * default address without providing an alternative.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.customerId The unique identifier of the customer who owns the
 *   address being deleted.
 * @param props.addressId The unique identifier of the customer address to be
