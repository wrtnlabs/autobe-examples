/**
 * Create a new reply to a product review (by seller or admin) in
 * shopping_mall_review_replies table.
 *
 * This endpoint permits authorized sellers or admins to post a reply to a
 * customer review on their product. On submission, the reply is validated for
 * maximum body length, normative status values (public/hidden), and ownership
 * by the acting seller or admin. Only one reply per review per responder is
 * permitted, preventing duplicate entries as enforced by schema constraints.
 *
 * The operation requires the review being replied to exist for the specified
 * product, enforcing referential integrity and protecting against orphaned
 * reply records. If the acting user does not have permission to reply (e.g.,
 * not the seller/admin of the product), access is denied. The reply status
 * determines its initial visibility to usersâ€”'public' for customer-visible
 * replies, 'hidden' for internal/admin-only replies.
 *
 * Business logic includes notification triggers for the original review author
 * upon reply, and audit logging for moderation. Error handling provides
 * actionable error codes/messages for permission, validation, or referential
 * integrity failures.

 * Access should be restricted to administrators or moderators with permission
 * to manage review replies. Business logic should enforce that only replies for
