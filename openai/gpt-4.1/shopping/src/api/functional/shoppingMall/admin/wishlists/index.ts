/**
 * Get detailed information about a specific wishlist by ID from
 * shopping_mall_wishlists.
 *
 * Retrieve the full details of a specific wishlist, including associated
 * product references and timestamps for creation and last modification.
 *
 * This operation references the shopping_mall_wishlists table and returns all
 * properties as defined in the Prisma schema, such as id,
 * shopping_mall_customer_id, created_at, and updated_at. The response includes
 * a list of wishlist items, each linking to a product via
 * shopping_mall_product_id.
 *
 * Access control must ensure that only the wishlist owner or authorized admin
 * roles can view this data. Business rules dictate that wishlists are
 * customer-specific and not visible to sellers or other regular users. Error
 * cases include requests for nonexistent, deleted, or unauthorized wishlists,
 * which should return appropriate errors.
 *
 * This operation supports user flows for retrieving their saved products for
 * browsing, future purchase, or management. It may be used by front-end
 * applications to display the user's saved/wishlist products. If additional
 * details of wishlist items are required (e.g., product info, images), they
 * should be retrieved in a joined or nested response according to the DTO
 * definition.
 *

/**
 * Update the details or settings of a customer's wishlist in the
 * shopping_mall_wishlists table.
 *
 * This API allows the owner (customer) of a wishlist to update its settings or
 * details. The operation is performed upon the shopping_mall_wishlists table,
 * whose schema supports fields such as updated_at, customer association, and
 * relational links to wishlist items. The update is only permitted for the
 * customer who owns the wishlist, or for a platform admin through an elevated
 * controller.
 *
 * Business logic for this operation includes verifying the authenticated user's
 * ownership, validating that the wishlist is not soft-deleted (deleted_at is
 * null), and that any modifications match value and integrity constraints
 * (e.g., length limits for names, or uniqueness for certain list properties).
 * The updated_at timestamp is refreshed upon successful operation.
 *
 * The operation is expected to fail if the wishlist does not exist, is soft
 * deleted, or is not owned by the authenticated user. All update actions are
 * logged for audit if the action is performed by an admin. Related APIs
 * typically include wishlist item CRUD operations and creation API for
 * wishlists.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.wishlistId Unique identifier (UUID) of the wishlist to update.
 * @param props.body Fields for updating the wishlist, such as name, settings,
 *   or properties. May include updates to related metadata, not to the items

/**
 * Soft delete a customer's wishlist in the shopping_mall_wishlists table by
 * marking it as deleted.
 *
 * This endpoint marks a customerâ€™s wishlist as deleted by updating the
 * deleted_at field with the current timestamp (soft delete). It operates on the
 * shopping_mall_wishlists table, which maintains wishlists for each customer
 * and supports soft deletion for audit, recovery, and compliance reasons.
 *
 * Security-wise, only the owner (authenticated customer) or an admin can
 * perform this operation, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot remove
 * wishlists belonging to others. Once soft deleted, the wishlist is flagged as
 * such and becomes inaccessible to user APIs.
 *
 * The business logic ensures that all references to the wishlist are maintained
 * for audit, but the resource is removed from user-facing displays and future
 * CRUD access. Attempting to delete a wishlist that does not exist, is already
 * deleted, or is not owned by the requester produces a relevant error.
 *
 * This operation is typically used in account cleanup, privacy flows, or
 * administrative maintenance. All actions are audited when performed by an
 * admin.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.wishlistId Unique identifier (UUID) of the wishlist to delete.
