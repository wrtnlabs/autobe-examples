/**
 * Retrieve all shipment status records for a specific order
 * (shopping_mall_order_shipments table).
 *
 * Retrieve a paginated, filterable list of all shipment records for a specified
 * order. Each record includes carrier, tracking number, shipping status,
 * shipment number, timestamps (dispatched, delivered, etc.), and remarks. This
 * operation is mapped to the shopping_mall_order_shipments table and supports
 * both simple and split-shipment order models (including multiple sellers). The
 * API allows users to check real-time shipment status updates and may integrate
 * with third-party carrier APIs for latest tracking data.
 *
 * Authorization and data visibility rules are strictly enforced: customers may
 * query only their own orders, sellers get access to shipments involving their
 * products, and admins access all shipments. The request may include advanced
 * filtering (e.g., by shipment status), pagination, and sorting (default: by
 * creation date descending).
 *
 * Error cases (such as unauthorized, not found, or order without shipments) are
 * surfaced with clear, actionable messages. This endpoint should be used in
 * concert with order listing, fulfillment, and order detail APIs for a complete
 * fulfillment tracking workflow.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.orderId Order ID for which all shipment records should be
 *   listed.
 * @param props.body Filtering and pagination options for shipment status
 *   retrieval (optional).
