# Problem Definition for Economic/Political Discussion Board

## Introduction
Online discussion of economic and political topics has become increasingly central to public dialogue, yet current mainstream platforms rarely provide a purpose-tailored, welcoming, and accessible environment for such discussions. Many participants—especially those less familiar with complex online forums—find it difficult to engage effectively or safely in nuanced conversations. This document defines the user needs, highlights barriers in existing solutions, and presents the opportunity for a new, focused discussion board.

## Current Challenges

### Fragmented Platforms
Economic and political discussions are diluted across numerous generic forums, social media groups, and comment sections. Specialized needs are not met, and the quality of debate can suffer from lack of focus or moderation.

### Complexity and Usability
Many existing solutions are technically demanding: users must learn complex navigation, cope with dense or cluttered interfaces, or master unfamiliar posting systems. This alienates less tech-savvy participants interested in meaningful engagement.

### Lack of Focus
Generic platforms often combine all topics, making it difficult to find, search, and participate in relevant economic/political threads. Content is buried quickly by off-topic posts, resulting in poor discoverability for serious discussions.

### Inconsistent Access
Some platforms limit visibility and participation to registered users only, while others expose users to unwanted publicity or harassment, discouraging open conversation.

### Inadequate Safeguards
Discussions sensitive by nature may lack mechanisms for user self-protection (privacy, anonymity, or clear consent to public discourse), discouraging open communication and new topic creation.

## Pain Points for Economic/Political Discussions

### Frustrations and Obstacles
- THE system SHALL enable users to easily create new topics relevant to economics and politics without requiring advanced technical knowledge (EARS: Ubiquitous).
- THE system SHALL permit both casual and committed users to browse public discussions without mandatory registration, lowering entry barriers (EARS: Ubiquitous).
- THE system SHALL allow registered users (“members”) to post replies and participate interactively in discussions (EARS: Ubiquitous).
- THE system SHALL provide simple, keyword-based searching/browsing features for economic or political threads (EARS: Ubiquitous).
- WHEN a user attempts to interact (post, reply) without proper authentication, THE system SHALL prompt for registration/login (EARS: Event-driven).
- IF a discussion thread grows excessively long, THEN THE system SHALL offer pagination or thread collapsing to keep navigation easy (EARS: Unwanted Behavior).
- THE system SHALL prioritize straightforward navigation and post/reply mechanisms with clear prompts and accessible UI structure (EARS: Ubiquitous/Biz Logic).

### Safety and Participation Barriers
- Users experience hesitation due to the risk of public exposure or harassment.
- Unmoderated discussions frequently devolve into off-topic or hostile debate, which suppresses thoughtful participation (note: moderation is not a core feature, but the lack thereof is a relevant background pain point).
- Complex permission or moderation hierarchies in existing systems confuse users who prefer open, egalitarian participation.

## Market Gap

### Unmet Needs
- **Focused Simplicity:** There are few, if any, dedicated platforms with a straightforward, minimal-feature design tailored for economic and political topics.
- **Accessibility:** The majority of users interested in these discussions are underserved by the technical and visual complexity of current solutions.
- **Open Participation with Simple Roles:** Existing platforms often force users into rigid role structures or obscure the ability to openly browse, post, and reply. The proposed system’s role structure (“guest,” “member,” “admin” for future needs) is designed for inclusivity and minimal friction.
- **Core Community Tools:** Essential functions required by the audience—easy registration, simple posting, reliable browsing and search—are rarely implemented as a unified package in current mainstream tools.

### Opportunity Statement
Creating a simple, modern economic/political discussion board with open readability, frictionless participation, and essential, focused tools directly addresses the limitations and pain points identified above. This approach enables broader community involvement, encourages healthy debate, and fills an existing market void.
