# Service Overview for Economic/Political Discussion Board

## Service Vision
The goal of this service is to provide an open and accessible digital platform where users can discuss, debate, and share ideas related to economic and political topics. The service aims to facilitate thoughtful, high-quality discussions for individuals ranging from casual observers to engaged citizens and active debaters. It seeks to lower the barriers to participating in online conversations about complex societal issues by prioritizing simple workflows and intuitive design, making it especially welcoming to those unfamiliar with traditional forum structures.

## Business Model

### Why This Service Exists
Online spaces for economic and political discussion are often fragmented, intimidating, or overly technical, discouraging broad participation. Many available platforms are driven by advertising, have strict moderation, or focus on entertainment rather than thoughtful civil discourse. Our discussion board exists to fill a gap: to provide a focused, user-friendly, and minimally moderated environment where newcomers, students, enthusiasts, and experienced participants can engage on equal footing about current events and foundational economic or political concepts.

### Revenue Strategy
Initially, the platform will launch with a community-driven and ad-free model to prioritize growth and openness. Over time, potential revenue streams may include non-intrusive advertising, optional supporter subscriptions (for badge or cosmetic account upgrades), or institutional sponsorships. The platform does not rely on charging typical members for core functionality.

### Growth Plan
The service aims to achieve organic user growth through search and content shareability. Special effort will be made to ensure that all public topics are indexable by search engines, driving inbound traffic from people seeking answers or ongoing discussions about economic and political issues. Outreach to schools, universities, and civic groups will help seed new discussions and attract early adopters. Accessibility and ease-of-use will be regularly evaluated to ensure the community remains welcoming.

### Success Metrics
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Number of topics and replies created per month
- User retention rate after first registration
- Average time to first reply per new topic
- Percentage of posts receiving at least one response
- Search query volume and traffic from external sources
- Growth in unique registered members

## Target Audience
- Visitors (guests) with an interest in economic and political topics who want to browse and search discussions without needing an account
- Members (registered users) who wish to post, reply, and participate more actively
- Students, civic enthusiasts, or first-time forum participants seeking a low-barrier way to join in debates and conversations
- Potential future group: Moderators or administrators (to be scaled up only if necessary, for basic management and health of the community)

## Value Proposition
- Simple, intuitive discussion experience intentionally designed for people new to forums and digital communities
- Completely open access to all public discussions for guests, removing friction for reading and searching
- Easy registration and login for users who want to post or reply, with privacy-respecting data practices
- Focus exclusively on core civic and economic topics, filtering out off-topic and unrelated content
- Lightweight role structure: guests (read/search only), members (full post/reply privileges), and optional admin oversight
- Absence of complex voting, ranking, or reputation systems to keep discussions focused on dialogue, not competition
