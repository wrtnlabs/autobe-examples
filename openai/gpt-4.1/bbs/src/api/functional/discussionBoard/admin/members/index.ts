/**
 * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of discussion board members
 * (admins only) from the 'discussion_board_members' table.
 *
 * Retrieve a paginated and optionally filtered list of registered members from
 * the discussion board. This operation enables searching by criteria such as
 * email address, username, registration date, and verification status. It also
 * supports pagination and sorting to handle large datasets efficiently.
 *
 * Administrators typically use this operation for user management and
 * oversight, but it can also provide member browsing features if needed for the
 * forum UI. Filtering is enforced according to available search fields as
 * defined on the 'discussion_board_members' table: 'email', 'username',
 * 'email_verified', and 'registration_completed_at'. Results are paginated to
 * prevent excessive load and improve usability.
 *
 * Only admins are authorized to list all members, as regular users should not
 * have access to private member data except their own. Any filtering or search
 * parameters must align with the data fields actually present in the schema. If
 * no matches are found, an empty result set is returned. Errors in search
 * criteria yield detailed validation messages to promote correct usage.

/**
 * Update an existing discussion board member (discussion_board_members table)
 * record by memberId.
 *
 * This API allows a discussion board member or an admin to update a member's
 * details. The primary use case is for users to update their own profile
 * information or for admins to update any member's account for management
 * purposes. The operation enforces email and username uniqueness, following the
 * database index constraints. Email changes require subsequent verification,
 * and password changes must use a hashed representation, not plain text. The
 * operation validates all input fields according to business rules: emails must
 * be valid and unique, usernames must not clash with existing users, and
 * passwords must meet established length and complexity rules. The system will
 * reject attempts to set inappropriate values or to update with information
 * that would violate business logic.
 *
 * Security considerations dictate that only the owning member (authenticated
 * via session/JWT) or an administrator may update a member account. Attempts by
 * other members or guests will result in an appropriate authorization failure
 * message. Updated_at is always set to the present time on any update, enabling
 * audit tracing. Soft-deleted accounts (where deleted_at is set) cannot be
 * updated and return an error if attempted.
 *
 * If a member's email is updated, their email_verified status will be reset,
 * and a new verification process must be completed. Admins may update all
 * non-credential fields directly but must handle credential resets according to
 * policy. Invalid updates—such as duplicate email/username or a prohibited
 * password—result in clear error messages with actionable guidance. This
 * endpoint helps members maintain control of their personal information while
 * ensuring system integrity.

/**
 * Delete (soft delete) a discussion board member (discussion_board_members
 * table) account by setting deleted_at, identified by memberId.
 *
 * This API allows a member or admin to delete a discussion board member account
 * using a unique memberId. Instead of a hard delete, it marks the account's
 * deleted_at field with the current timestamp (soft delete), supporting future
 * recovery and audit requirements. Deleting an account disables further logins
 * for that member, prevents any authoring of topics or replies, and removes
 * access to personal account settings. Posts and replies authored by the member
 * remain visible unless additional moderation policies require anonymization or
 * removal. Authorization checks ensure that only the member themselves,
 * authenticated via session/JWT, or an admin may perform this deletion. The
 * operation cannot be performed on already soft-deleted accounts and will
 * return an error if attempted. This design preserves discussion continuity and
 * ensures that system audit trails reflect all account changes as mandated by
 * business and compliance rules.
 *
 * Security is enforced by verifying the requesting user's identity and role.
 * Members can only delete their own accounts, while admins can delete any
 * member's account. Attempts to delete another member's account by non-admins
 * will fail with an explicit permission denied message. Deleted accounts are
 * non-recoverable without administrative intervention. If an account is already
 * marked as deleted, a clear error is returned. There is no response body for
 * this operation; success is indicated via standard HTTP status.
