/**
 * Test deletion of a member's own comment from a post with proper authorization
 * and soft-delete validation, including edge cases for non-authorized access
 * and already-deleted comments.
 *
 * 1. Register and authenticate as memberA
 * 2. Create a community as memberA
 * 3. Create a post in the community as memberA
 * 4. Add a root comment to the post as memberA
 * 5. Add a child (threaded) comment to the root comment as memberA
 * 6. Delete the root comment as memberA (should soft-delete only root, not child)
 * 7. Confirm root comment's deleted_at is set, child comment unaffected
 * 8. Attempt to delete the comment as memberB (should fail - not author)
 * 9. Attempt to delete an already-deleted comment (should fail appropriately)
