/**
 * Validate that platform admin accounts have universal permission to delete any
 * comment for moderation and content safety, regardless of authorship or
 * community.
 *
 * Business context: Only platform admins possess absolute moderation ability
 * for deleting/soft-deleting comments (including parent/child) from any post in
 * any community. Admin deletion actions must leave audit/compliance evidence
 * and NOT physically erase comments, but set deleted_at to mark the comment as
 * deleted. Moderation actions must work regardless of nesting or author.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a unique platform admin and keep admin session.
 * 2. Register a non-admin member. (Different actor)
 * 3. Member creates a community via the normal member-completion path to provide a
 *    community context (member is creator).
 * 4. Member creates a post (in their community).
 * 5. Member creates a root comment (to-be parent).
 * 6. Member creates a child reply comment (reply-to-root; nesting).
 * 7. Admin (admin session) invokes the admin DELETE endpoint for the root comment
 *    (parent of reply), targeting member's post.
 * 8. Verify that:
 *
 *    - The targeted root comment's deleted_at is now set (soft-deleted).
 *    - The child reply's business logic is consistent: either remains, is orphaned,
 *         or is (if applicable) also soft-deleted depending on platform
 *         policy.
 *    - Only the targeted comment is affected unless platform requires recursive
 *         delete; verify child reply's existence and status.
 *    - Audit logs/registers admin as the actor of moderation (Note: audit log check
 *         may require fetching or validation via companion mechanism if API
 *         exists).
 * 9. (Edge) Attempt to delete child reply as admin (should succeed as well).
 * 10. Validate both comments' deleted_at timestamps and status, remain present but
 *     marked deleted.
 * 11. (Error path) Try deleting the same comment again as adminâ€”should error or be
 *     a no-op, not crash (error test).
