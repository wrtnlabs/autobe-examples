/**
 * Test the hard deletion of an escalation log by a platform admin in the
 * Reddit-like platform scenario.
 *
 * Business context: This test validates the process and access control for
 * permanently deleting an escalation log, which is used for compliance, audit,
 * and dispute review workflows. Only an authenticated admin should be able to
 * perform this operation; after deletion, the log should be irretrievable and
 * any attempt to delete with invalid or non-existent IDs must yield appropriate
 * errors.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a new platform admin who will perform the deletion.
 * 2. As admin, create a new moderation report category for use in reporting.
 * 3. As a member (simulated - since member registration is not within this
 *    function), file a new report using the created category (either for a post
 *    or comment, using random UUIDs if needed).
 * 4. Create an escalation log referencing the report. The escalation log must
 *    reference both the report and the admin (as destination_admin_id if
 *    needed).
 * 5. As admin, call the escalation log hard delete endpoint with the
 *    escalationLogId.
 * 6. Attempt to delete the same escalation log again, expecting an error since it
 *    should not exist (idempotence, irretrievability).
 * 7. Attempt to delete a completely invalid escalationLogId (random UUID),
 *    expecting an error.
 * 8. Optionally check audit or compliance review indications as allowed by the API
 *    (not implemented if not available).
 * 9. Confirm only admins can delete; simulate by resetting connection (removing
 *    auth) and attempt delete, expecting an access/authorization failure.
