 * 3. As the member, create a new community (all fields unique).
 * 4. As the member, subscribe to that community, creating a subscription.
 * 5. As the admin, fetch the subscription log event detail (for the subscribe
 *    event) using:
 *
 *    - The ID of the subscription created above as subscriptionId.
 *    - The ID of the log record for the subscribe event (guaranteed to exist after
 *         subscription) as logId.
 * 6. Assert that the returned log record matches the expected subscriptionId,

 *    error.
 * 8. Edge: Attempt to fetch a correct logId with an invalid (random)
 *    subscriptionId; expect an error.
