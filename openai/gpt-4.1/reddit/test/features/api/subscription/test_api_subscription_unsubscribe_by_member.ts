/**
 * Validate the unsubscribe (soft delete) flow for a member's community
 * subscription.
 *
 * Ensures an authenticated member can register, create a community, subscribe
 * to it, and then unsubscribe. After unsubscribe, tests that 'deleted_at' is
 * set and that the subscription record is still accessible for audit/history.
 * Also validates that attempting to unsubscribe a subscription not owned by the
 * member fails as a permission error.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register member A (primary tester)
 * 2. Member A creates a community
 * 3. Member A subscribes to the community
 * 4. Member A unsubscribes
 * 5. Assert 'deleted_at' is set and returned when reading the subscription
 * 6. Register member B
 * 7. Attempt to let member B unsubscribe member A's former subscription (should
 *    fail)
