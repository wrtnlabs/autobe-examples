# Non-Functional Requirements for Reddit-like Community Platform

## Performance Expectations

### Responsiveness
- WHEN a user triggers any standard operation (registration, login, view/post/comment/vote), THE communityPlatform SHALL respond with a visible result within 2 seconds for 99% of requests, under normal load.
- WHEN a user loads a community feed of up to 20 posts, THE communityPlatform SHALL deliver the initial data set within 1.5 seconds for the majority of requests, using pagination or infinite scroll as needed.
- WHEN a user navigates between profile, post, or community pages, THE communityPlatform SHALL maintain a page load time of less than 1 second after assets are cached.
- IF the system cannot meet target response times, THEN THE communityPlatform SHALL display an error or progress notification and log the incident for follow-up.

### Throughput and Concurrency
- THE communityPlatform SHALL support a minimum of 1,000 concurrent active users per community at launch, with the capacity to scale to 50,000 concurrent platform-wide users, maintaining performance standards above.
- WHERE a community experiences a traffic spike (e.g., viral post), THE communityPlatform SHALL automatically balance loads to maintain responsiveness, with queueing or temporary rate limiting where absolutely necessary.

### High Availability
- THE communityPlatform SHALL be available 99.9% of the time per month (less than 45 minutes downtime per month, excluding planned maintenance), with all user-facing features operational.
- WHEN system-level faults or outages occur, THE communityPlatform SHALL provide users with clear, non-technical status messages and maintain data integrity during recovery.

## Scalability Requirements

### Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
- THE communityPlatform SHALL use scalable service patterns to increase capacity with user growth, including horizontal scaling (add instances) and vertical scaling (expand resources), so all communities—large or niche—remain performant.
- WHEN a new feature causes increased backend demand, THE communityPlatform SHALL scale out required services automatically or with minimal manual intervention to maintain SLAs.
- WHEN platform activity exceeds 80% of available capacity, THE communityPlatform SHALL trigger load monitoring and auto-scaling notification for investigation and remedial action.

### Data Growth Management
- THE communityPlatform SHALL support steady growth of posts, comments, and votes, with seamless data sharding, archiving, or partitioning as required to keep performance within expectation for active users.
- IF a community or the entire platform exceeds storage or throughput warnings, THEN THE communityPlatform SHALL alert administrators and implement rate limiting or automated archiving as necessary.

## Security & Privacy

### Authentication and Session Management
- WHEN a user logs in, THE communityPlatform SHALL use secure, role-based authentication as defined in [User Roles and Authentication Specification](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md), with encrypted session tokens (e.g., JWTs).
- WHEN a user's session is idle for more than 30 minutes, THE communityPlatform SHALL require re-authentication or token refresh.
- WHERE elevated actions (moderation, administration) occur, THE communityPlatform SHALL enforce strict permissions and audit logs for tracking who performed which action and when.

### Data Protection
- THE communityPlatform SHALL encrypt all user authentication credentials, email addresses, and sensitive profile details at rest and in transit.
- WHEN a user requests account deletion, THE communityPlatform SHALL permanently erase user-identifiable data, except where legal retention or abuse prevention requires otherwise.
- WHEN user content is removed (by user, moderator, or admin), THE communityPlatform SHALL retain audit metadata but redact display of deleted materials unless required for moderation evidence.
- IF a data breach is detected or suspected, THEN THE communityPlatform SHALL initiate incident response, notify affected users, and provide information per regulatory requirements.

### Role Boundaries, Abuse Prevention, and User Controls
- WHERE a user reports content, THE communityPlatform SHALL handle reports privately, store report data securely, and only surface information to authorized moderators or admins.
- WHERE a moderator operates, THE communityPlatform SHALL ensure their permissions are limited to assigned communities and all moderation actions are logged.
- WHERE an admin performs global actions (user ban, community removal), THE communityPlatform SHALL double-confirm intent and audit each step to prevent accidental or malicious misuse.
- WHERE users are minors or reside in regulated jurisdictions, THE communityPlatform SHALL comply with applicable privacy laws (COPPA, GDPR, etc.), requiring parental consent and privacy-by-default as needed.

## Compliance

### Legal, Policy, and Data Jurisdiction
- THE communityPlatform SHALL store all user and content data in legally appropriate jurisdictions, with server location and data transfer tracked for compliance with GDPR, CCPA, or other relevant regulation.
- WHEN responding to user data access, portability, or deletion requests under applicable law, THE communityPlatform SHALL fulfill such requests within 30 calendar days unless an explicit exception applies.
- THE communityPlatform SHALL publish a platform-wide privacy and usage policy, content guidelines, and transparency log as specified in [Policies and Compliance Document](./10-policies-and-compliance.md).

### Audit, Logging, and Traceability
- THE communityPlatform SHALL maintain audit trails for all role changes, content removals, bans, and escalated reports, with tamper resistance and retention for at least 12 months, except where law requires longer storage.
- WHEN reviewing moderation or admin actions, THE communityPlatform SHALL enable authorized reviewers to trace the sequence of events leading to action, while protecting the privacy of non-involved users.
