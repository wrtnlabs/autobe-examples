   * privileges. It references the
   * community_platform_community_moderator_assignments table in the schema,

   * rationale and auditing information.
   *
   * The request body should provide all necessary assignment details (target

   * notes). The system ensures that the member exists, is not already assigned
   * as a moderator with the same role, and is eligible for moderation duties.
   * It checks assignment quotas, avoids duplicates, and ensures compliance with
   * business rules described in requirements analysis (moderator assignment by
   * admins or owner-moderators, per audit/compliance control).
   *
   * Security controls require all assignment actions to be logged. If a
   * community is archived or does not exist, or the actor is not authorized, an
   * appropriate error is returned. The response includes the full assignment
   * entity created, for immediate use (such as interface update or audit
   * view).
