   * Permissions should restrict non-admin/moderator users from retrieving files
   * they do not own or are not allowed to view. Sensitive metadata, such as
   * storage keys or file URLs, are handled according to platform privacy
   * policy, only surfaced if access is warranted by the user's role (such as
   * moderator or admin). Records reflect the Prisma schema's design, including
   * the use of soft delete via the deleted_at field, which supports both active
   * and archived asset queries. The operation validates complex filter input
   * and handles errors for out-of-bounds page/sort specifications.
   *
   * Administrators can use this endpoint for management review, abuse
   * investigations, or media inventory, while users may access it for reviewing
   * their own uploads or download history. Any soft-deleted files should be

   * for audit logging or asset cleanup can reference this operation for
   * evidence gathering and compliance checks.

  /**
   * Permanently erase a file upload record from the platform database
   * (community_platform_file_uploads).
   *
   * The purpose of this operation is to delete a file upload entry from the
   * community_platform_file_uploads table, which tracks all files users have
   * uploaded to the platform (e.g., profile pictures, post images, community
   * banners/icons). The operation takes a fileUploadId as a path parameter and
   * will remove the associated row. This includes enforcing referential
   * integrity, meaning files used in banners, post images, or community images
   * are also removed if they lose their reference, according to onDelete:
   * Cascade.
   *
   * File records contain metadata for file location (storage_key, url),
   * ownership (uploaded_by_member_id), MIME type, and status (active, deleted).
   * The field 'deleted_at' is updated to the current timestamp when a soft
   * deletion occurs; for hard delete, the row is removed entirely. Deleting an
   * upload is a privileged action: only a moderator or admin may erase a file.
   * The operation ensures audit logging and may trigger further cleanups in
   * related image or post tables.
   *
   * Related operations include uploading a new file (POST), restoring
   * (undelete) a soft-deleted file, and listing files for a user or community.
   * Validation includes ensuring the fileUploadId exists, the user has correct
   * role and ownership or admin rights, and that the file is not currently
   * required for non-deletable key entities. Errors include attempting to
   * delete files still referenced as essential in the schema (e.g., a current
   * banner image), lack of permission, or not found (404).
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param fileUploadId Unique identifier for the file upload record to be
   *   deleted, must be UUID format.
