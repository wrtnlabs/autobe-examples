   * Create a new configuration setting for the community platform. The
   * operation inserts a row into the community_platform_system_configs table,
   * establishing a key-value setting used for runtime feature toggles,
   * thresholds, or global switches. This operation is crucial for system
   * flexibility, allowing administrators to dynamically adjust platform
   * behavior (including enable/disable of experimental features, setting
   * posting or karma limits, and more) without requiring code changes or
   * redeployment.
   *
   * Access to this operation is restricted to administrative users, as it
   * impacts platform-wide stability and feature availability. Each
   * configuration entry must have a unique key, a string value (which can
   * represent JSON, numbers, or booleans serialized as strings), and an
   * explanatory description. Fields such as created_at and updated_at are
   * handled automatically by the system. If a duplicate key is submitted, the
   * operation must fail with a clear error message, and no data is inserted.
   *
   * Validation rules include mandatory key uniqueness, non-empty value, and
   * proper descriptive text. Related operations include updating or deleting
   * configs and querying the current system configuration map. Errors may arise
   * from uniqueness violations, forbidden access, or invalid field formats.
