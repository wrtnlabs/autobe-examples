   * The workflow requires precise validation: the associated report must exist

   * admins and tracked for audit purposes to ensure complete transparency of
   * the moderation process.
   *
   * Security and abuse-prevention considerations are critical; only
   * authenticated members, moderators, or admins may create an escalation, and
   * all actions are thoroughly logged. Invalid references, lack of rights, or
   * missing required information results in explicit error responses as per

   * Escalation logs record all transfers of unresolved or complex moderation
   * reports from general moderators to admin review, documenting when and why
   * escalation occurred, who initiated it, and how it was ultimately resolved.
   *
   * The operation provides robust filtering options by escalation status
   * (pending, in_review, resolved, closed), report ID, initiator, assigned
   * admin, and event time range. The response object includes both the
   * paginated list of escalation log summaries and pagination metadata (e.g.,
   * total count, current page). Authorization is restricted to users with
   * appropriate permissions—typically administrators and assigned moderators
   * with community management rights.
   *
   * Additional security considerations include preventing access to escalations
   * unrelated to the requester's scope (e.g., moderators cannot view
   * escalations outside their community assignment, and only admins see all
   * logs). Filtering may also be applied based on time period for audit queries
   * or compliance checks.
   *
   * If no logs match the given criteria or page, the response returns an empty
   * result set with appropriate pagination metadata.
