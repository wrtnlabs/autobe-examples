/**
 * Search and filter platform members (users) with pagination and detailed
 * criteria (community_platform_members).
 *
 * This operation enables administrators and authorized moderators to search the
 * list of registered members (users) of the community platform. It accesses the
 * community_platform_members table and supports advanced filtering by email
 * (partial match), registration date, last updated date, and account status.
 * Paging and sorting options ensure that large user lists are manageable, with
 * results returned as paginated summaries.
 *
 * Each result record contains the member's ID, email, current status, creation
 * and update times, and, if allowed, additional public properties. Sensitive
 * authentication details, such as the password hash, are never returned. Search
 * operations may be rate-limited and are typically used for management,
 * moderation, user analytics, audit logging, or verification flows.
 *
 * Security is enforced via admin or moderator roles: only those roles can
 * retrieve the full user list or see accounts in 'blocked' or 'deleted' status.
 * Usage includes finding potentially abusive accounts, filtering members by
 * verification state, or generating audit/compliance reports. Related endpoints
 * include retrieval of individual member details (GET by ID), status update
 * (PUT), and creation or removal of users (for admin systems). Errors include
 * invalid filter criteria or access denied for insufficient permissions.

 * @param props.body Filter, search, and pagination options for listing members,

/**
 * Permanently delete (hard-delete) a member account from
 * community_platform_members.
 *
 * Delete a member account from the platform by its unique identifier. This
 * endpoint enables administrators to perform hard deletion (irreversible
 * removal) of a user, including all associated posts, comments, votes, and
 * subscriptions. The operation first checks admin-level authorization, verifies
 * that the member ID exists, and enforces all relational cascade deletions as
 * defined in the Prisma schema. This action is critical for fulfilling account
 * erasure and legal compliance requests.
 *
 * The operation is tightly integrated with the community_platform_members
 * table, referencing relational constraints with dependent records in the
 * communities, posts, comments, votes, subscriptions, karma, and reports
 * tables. As the Prisma schema supports a soft delete via 'deleted_at', but
 * this API implements hard deletion, the operation ensures all data is
 * unrecoverable after execution.
 *
 * Expected behavior includes proper audit logging of the action and
 * notification to all affected subsystems. Error handling is implemented for
 * non-existent IDs, insufficient permissions, and failed transactional deletes.
 * The response is empty, indicating successful erasure or returns error details
 * if unsuccessful.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.memberId The UUID of the member to be permanently deleted.
