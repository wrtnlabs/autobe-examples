/**
 * Create a new escalation log entry for moderation/admin review in
 * community_platform_escalation_logs.
 *
 * Create an escalation log to elevate unresolved or special-case moderation
 * reports to administrative review. This operation records a new escalation
 * entry with details including the initiator, target report, escalation reason,
 * destination admin (if any), and initial status.
 *
 * The workflow requires precise validation: the associated report must exist
 * and the requesting user must have a legitimate reason and role to escalate.
 * The Prisma schema assures relational integrity with references to reports,
 * admins, and members. All escalations are subsequently visible to assigned
 * admins and tracked for audit purposes to ensure complete transparency of the
 * moderation process.
 *
 * Security and abuse-prevention considerations are critical; only authenticated
 * members, moderators, or admins may create an escalation, and all actions are
 * thoroughly logged. Invalid references, lack of rights, or missing required
 * information results in explicit error responses as per audit and platform
 * policy.

/**
 * Retrieve and search escalation logs (admin and authorized moderators).
 *
 * This endpoint enables authorized users to search, paginate, and filter
 * escalation log records from the 'community_platform_escalation_logs' table.
 * Escalation logs record all transfers of unresolved or complex moderation
 * reports from general moderators to admin review, documenting when and why
 * escalation occurred, who initiated it, and how it was ultimately resolved.
 *
 * The operation provides robust filtering options by escalation status
 * (pending, in_review, resolved, closed), report ID, initiator, assigned admin,
 * and event time range. The response object includes both the paginated list of
 * escalation log summaries and pagination metadata (e.g., total count, current
 * page). Authorization is restricted to users with appropriate
 * permissions—typically administrators and assigned moderators with community
 * management rights.
 *
 * Additional security considerations include preventing access to escalations
 * unrelated to the requester's scope (e.g., moderators cannot view escalations
 * outside their community assignment, and only admins see all logs). Filtering
 * may also be applied based on time period for audit queries or compliance
 * checks.
 *
 * If no logs match the given criteria or page, the response returns an empty
 * result set with appropriate pagination metadata.
