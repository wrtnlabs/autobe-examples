/**
 * Get detailed information for a specific member ban history record by
 * banHistoryId (community_platform_ban_histories).
 *
 * Retrieve and view a detailed ban history entry for a particular member,
 * moderator, or admin as recorded in the ban histories table.
 *
 * This API operation supports security-critical moderation review and is
 * accessible only to authorized administrators and, as appropriate, to
 * community-level moderators with scope for the affected ban. Path parameter
 * banHistoryId is required and must be a valid UUID matching an existing ban
 * record. The operation returns all properties of the ban including who issued
 * it, for which member, within which community (if applicable), duration, type,
 * whether the ban is active, the reason provided by the moderator or admin, and
 * references to the triggering report if the ban originated from a user
 * report.
 *
 * Data exposure must be carefully controlled: only authorized actors can access
 * ban history, and sensitive information about admin/moderator actors will be
 * displayed according to role and business rules. Error responses are returned
 * if the banHistoryId is not found or the caller lacks permission.
 *
 * This endpoint relates closely to audit and escalation workflows as bans may
 * be referenced in appeal, compliance requests, or moderation dashboards.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.banHistoryId The unique identifier of the ban history record to
 *   retrieve.
