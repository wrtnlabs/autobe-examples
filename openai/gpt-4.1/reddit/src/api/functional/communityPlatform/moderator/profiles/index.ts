/**
 * Search and retrieve paginated user profiles, based on
 * community_platform_profiles.
 *
 * This API operation retrieves a filtered and paginated collection of user
 * profiles from the community_platform_profiles table, supporting discovery,
 * moderation, and analytics scenarios. Profile records include basic details
 * such as username, display name, avatar URI, public visibility flag, short
 * status, bio, and related timestamps.
 *
 * Moderators and admins can use this endpoint to search for suspicious or
 * noteworthy accounts by text, time window, or status. Regular members may have
 * restricted visibility (or none at all) depending on platform settings and
 * their own authentication state; only public profiles are returned unless
 * higher privileges are assigned. Sensitive user data such as email, history,
 * or preferences are omitted or redacted for privacy. Filtering supports
 * username, status, creation and update times, and text search within bios or
 * display names. Sorting by creation, activity, or username is available to
 * help discover new or trending users.
 *
 * Paginated results improve usability for large user bases. Typically, this
 * endpoint would be called by admin dashboards, user search modules, or
 * community moderation tools for managing and analyzing platform communities.
