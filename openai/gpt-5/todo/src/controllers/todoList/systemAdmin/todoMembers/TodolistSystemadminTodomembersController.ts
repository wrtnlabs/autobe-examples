  /**
   * Retrieve a Todo member (todo_list_todo_members) by ID for administrative
   * use.
   *
   * Fetch a todo_list_todo_members record identified by todoMemberId. According
   * to the Prisma schema description, this table represents authenticated
   * members who own personal Todos. Fields include id (UUID primary key), email
   * (unique identifier), password_hash (stored securely and never returned in
   * responses), created_at, updated_at, and a nullable deleted_at column for
   * deactivation. The relationship to business data is explicit: members own
   * multiple todo_list_todos through the owner relation.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Because member records contain sensitive account
   * information, access should be restricted to policy-authorized actors,
   * typically administrative users. The response must exclude credential
   * secrets such as password_hash and should present only safe account metadata
   * (e.g., id, email, created_at, updated_at, and deactivation status if
   * represented). If the target record is not available within the requesterâ€™s
   * authorized scope, return a neutral not-available outcome.
   *
   * Database relationships and consistency: The todo_list_todo_members table
   * has a one-to-many relationship to todo_list_todos. Deleting a member
   * cascades to their Todos (onDelete: Cascade), but this operation is
   * read-only and returns only the member view. If deleted_at is populated per
   * business policy, implementations may treat the member as deactivated for
   * operations, while still allowing administrative reads.
   *
   * Validation and error handling: The path parameter todoMemberId must be a
   * valid UUID string. If the identifier does not correspond to any accessible
   * record, return a not-available result. Validation errors (malformed UUIDs)
   * should be conveyed clearly. The response DTO must intentionally omit
   * password_hash and any similarly sensitive fields.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param todoMemberId Unique identifier of the Todo member to retrieve
