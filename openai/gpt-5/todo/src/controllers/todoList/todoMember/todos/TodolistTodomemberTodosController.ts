   * Search and paginate member-owned Todos from Prisma table todo_list_todos.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered, ordered, and paginated list of Todo records from the
   * Prisma model todo_list_todos. According to the schema comments, each Todo
   * belongs to exactly one member via the foreign key column
   * todo_list_todo_member_id and has fields: id, title, is_completed,
   * completed_at (nullable), created_at, and updated_at. The list is strictly
   * scoped to the requesting member by matching todo_list_todo_member_id to the
   * authenticated member’s identifier. Business filtering includes three states
   * derived from is_completed: All (no additional filter), Active (is_completed
   * = false), and Completed (is_completed = true). The default ordering is
   * created_at descending so that newly created items appear first.
   *
   * Security considerations align with role-based access described in the
   * requirements: only todoMember actors can call this operation. guestVisitor
   * actors are denied. The provider must not return Todos owned by other
   * members and should avoid messages that reveal whether other members’ items
   * exist. Ownership enforcement is performed through the
   * todo_list_todo_member_id relation to the owner table
   * todo_list_todo_members.
   *
   * This operation integrates directly with the underlying database entity
   * todo_list_todos and its relation owner. Validation rules include enforcing
   * allowed pagination bounds (default size 20; allowed 10–50 inclusive) and
   * accepted status filter values. Request parameters should be validated
   * before querying. The response returns a paginated collection optimized for
   * list displays as ITodoListTodo summaries, including page metadata.
   *
   * Related operations include the detail retrieval GET /todos/{todoId}, which
   * returns a single record owned by the requester. Typical error handling
   * includes returning an empty page when the requested page index exceeds
   * available results, and a validation error when pagination or filter
   * parameters violate policy.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search, filter, and pagination parameters for the member’s
   *   Todos

  /**
   * Get a single Todo from Prisma table todo_list_todos by id.

   * Return a single Todo record from the Prisma model todo_list_todos
   * identified by the path parameter todoId. The database schema defines
   * columns id (UUID primary key), title, is_completed, completed_at
   * (nullable), created_at, and updated_at. The record is also linked to the
   * owner via todo_list_todo_member_id with a relation to
   * todo_list_todo_members. Only the owner is permitted to access the record in
   * normal operation; other users must not be able to infer its existence.
   *
   * Security and permissions: This endpoint is available to todoMember actors
   * only. The provider must verify that the requested record’s
   * todo_list_todo_member_id matches the authenticated member’s id. If the
   * record is not owned by the requester or does not exist, respond with a
   * neutral not-available outcome consistent with privacy requirements rather
   * than leaking ownership.
   *
   * Validation and error handling: Validate that todoId is a well-formed UUID
   * before querying. If the item is not found within the requester’s scope,
   * return a not-found response. This operation complements the collection
   * retrieval /todos (PATCH), which provides pagination and filtering.

   * is present only when is_completed is true.

  /**
   * Delete a Todo (todo_list_todos) by ID with ownership enforcement and hard
   * deletion.
   *
   * Delete a specific Todo item identified by todoId from the todo_list_todos
   * table. The Prisma schema comment describes this table as the core entity
   * for the minimal personal task list with a required title, a simple
   * completion state (is_completed), an optional completed_at timestamp
   * recorded when transitioning to completed, and lifecycle timestamps
   * created_at and updated_at. Each record belongs to exactly one member
   * through todo_list_todo_member_id and an owner relation to
   * todo_list_todo_members.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only the owning member is allowed to delete the
   * Todo. The provider must verify that the authenticated
   * todo_list_todo_members.id matches the
   * todo_list_todos.todo_list_todo_member_id for the target record. If the
   * record is not owned by the requester or is not visible, the service should
   * return a privacy-preserving not-available outcome without leaking existence
   * details.
   *
   * Database relationships: The owner relation connects todo_list_todos to
   * todo_list_todo_members with onDelete: Cascade. This operation deletes a
   * single todo_list_todos record by id and does not modify the owner record.
   * The table lacks a deletion marker column; therefore, the deletion here is
   * complete and records are removed from storage.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: The path parameter todoId must be a valid
   * UUID string. The operation should be idempotent from a client perspective:
   * if the record is already absent or inaccessible to the requester, return a
   * neutral not-available result. When the deletion succeeds, subsequent list
   * and detail requests must no longer return the item.
   *
   * Related operations and behavior: Typical client flows include creating
   * Todos, listing per owner with newest-first ordering, updating titles, and
   * toggling completion. After a successful delete, client UIs should refresh
   * lists to reflect removal. Error handling should provide clear messages for
   * validation errors (malformed identifiers) and neutral handling for
   * not-available cases.

   * @param todoId Unique identifier of the Todo to delete
