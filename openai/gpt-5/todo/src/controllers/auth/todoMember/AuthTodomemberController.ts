  /**
   * Register a member in Prisma table todo_list_todo_members and issue JWTs.
   *
   * Purpose: Register a new todoMember account using `email` and a password,
   * persisting to the Prisma table `todo_list_todo_members`. The table defines
   * `id` (PK, UUID), `email` (unique), `password_hash` (hashed credential),
   * `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at` (nullable). Registration
   * inserts a new row with `email` normalized to lowercase and a securely
   * computed `password_hash`. `created_at` and `updated_at` are set to the
   * current time, and `deleted_at` remains null to indicate an active member.
   *
   * Implementation: The provider must hash the incoming password before
   * storage, never persisting plaintext. The unique constraint on `email` (see
   * `@@unique([email])`) requires collision handling. On success, the service
   * generates JWTs for session establishment and returns an authorization DTO
   * representing the authenticated state. The flow does not modify other
   * entities like `todo_list_todos`.
   *
   * Role integration: This operation applies to the member role (business role:
   * todoMember) and results in ownership for future Todos via the relationship
   * from `todo_list_todos.todo_list_todo_member_id` to
   * `todo_list_todo_members.id`. Although Todos are not created here, this
   * account becomes the owner reference for all personal Todo operations.
   *
   * Security: Enforce password strength policies; minimize error detail on
   * `email` uniqueness conflicts to avoid enumeration. Ensure timestamps
   * (`created_at`, `updated_at`) are properly set. `deleted_at` must be null
   * for active accounts; attempts to register an email with a previously
   * deactivated account should follow policy (e.g., restoration) without
   * disclosing sensitive state.
   *
   * Related operations: Use Login to authenticate existing members using
   * `email` and `password_hash` verification, and Refresh to renew tokens using
   * a valid refresh token. Together these endpoints form the authentication
   * lifecycle for `todo_list_todo_members`.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Registration payload including email and password.

  /**
   * Authenticate against Prisma table todo_list_todo_members and issue JWTs.
   *
   * Purpose: Authenticate a todoMember whose identity is recorded in
   * `todo_list_todo_members` with fields `email`, `password_hash`,
   * `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at`. Login verifies that
   * `deleted_at` is null (active account) and the provided password matches
   * `password_hash` using a strong hash verifier.
   *
   * Implementation: Normalize the input email to lowercase before lookup, then
   * perform constant-time password verification against `password_hash`. Do not
   * reveal whether the email exists or whether the password is wrong; return a
   * neutral authentication failure. On success, issue new JWTs and return an
   * authorization payload. Optionally refresh `updated_at` to reflect recent
   * activity per policy.
   *
   * Role integration: Successful login yields authorization for the todoMember
   * role, enabling access to personal Todo operations via the relationship from
   * `todo_list_todos.todo_list_todo_member_id` to `todo_list_todo_members.id`.
   *
   * Security: Enforce lockout or throttling on repeated failures according to
   * policy; ensure safe handling of unique constraint on `email`. Prevent
   * authentication for deactivated accounts where `deleted_at` is not null
   * unless an explicit restore flow is executed.
   *
   * Related operations: Join for initial account creation and Refresh for token
   * renewal. These operations together manage the session lifecycle for

  /**
   * Refresh JWTs for an active member anchored to todo_list_todo_members.
   *
   * Purpose: Renew access for an authenticated todoMember using a valid refresh
   * token. The member identity is anchored to the `todo_list_todo_members`
   * table which defines `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`,
   * `updated_at`, and `deleted_at`. Refresh verifies the token, locates the
   * member, confirms `deleted_at` is null, and returns newly minted JWTs.
   *
   * Implementation: Validate refresh token integrity and expiration, map it to
   * the member `id`, and ensure the corresponding row remains active. Avoid
   * touching `password_hash` or other member fields; only token issuance
   * occurs. Do not disclose account existence or state beyond necessary error
   * semantics.
   *
   * Role integration: Successful refresh maintains the todoMember’s
   * authenticated state required for personal Todo operations whose ownership
   * is tied via `todo_list_todos.todo_list_todo_member_id`.
   *
   * Security: Enforce rotation/invalidation policies on refresh tokens; reject
   * tokens for deactivated accounts where `deleted_at` is not null. Log
   * minimal, non-sensitive telemetry.

   *
   * Purpose: Deactivate the authenticated todoMember account by setting
   * `deleted_at` on the corresponding row in `todo_list_todo_members`. This
   * aligns with the schema’s description of `deleted_at` as a soft deletion
   * marker where null means active.
   *
   * Implementation: Require authentication (role todoMember). Set `deleted_at`
   * to the current timestamp and update `updated_at` to now. Do not modify
   * `email` or `password_hash`. After success, the member should not be able to
   * authenticate or refresh tokens until restored. This operation does not

   * prevent access while deactivated.
   *
   * Role integration: Represents a member-controlled security state change,
