   * Register a new administrator in Prisma table todo_list_system_admins and
   * issue JWT authorization.
   *
   * This endpoint registers a new administrative user by inserting a record
   * into the Prisma model todo_list_system_admins. The core fields relevant to
   * registration are email for unique identity and password_hash for credential
   * storage. At creation time, created_at and updated_at must be set, and
   * deleted_at must remain null to represent an active administrator. The
   * primary key id is a UUID generated by the service layer.
   *
   * Implementation uses the table’s @@unique([email]) constraint to prevent
   * duplicates. The service must normalize email to lowercase prior to
   * validation and persistence, and it must derive password_hash using a strong
   * algorithm such as Argon2id or Bcrypt; plaintext passwords are never stored.
   * On successful creation, the system issues JWT credentials and returns an
   * authorization payload instead of raw database fields. The request body
   * carries the minimal inputs necessary to produce the new admin record
   * (email, password) which are transformed into email and password_hash in
   * persistence.
   *
   * This operation is specific to the systemAdmin role and establishes an
   * account able to administer service-level settings. It does not grant
   * routine access to private member Todos; such access is out of scope and
   * would be separately policy-gated. The returned authorization DTO reflects
   * the authenticated identity and token set for a systemAdmin.
   *
   * Security considerations include enforcing the unique email constraint and
   * rejecting attempts to register an email that already exists in
   * todo_list_system_admins. The service must ensure password hashing is
   * applied before storing to password_hash and should avoid timing leakage in
   * error responses. Records with a non-null deleted_at are deactivated and
   * must not be used to establish new sessions.
   *
   * Related operations include the systemAdmin login for credential-based
   * authentication and the token refresh operation for renewing access tokens.
   * Clients generally call join once for initial setup, then subsequently use
   * login and refresh as needed.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Admin registration payload (e.g., email and password to be
   *   hashed).

  /**
   * Authenticate a system administrator via todo_list_system_admins and issue
   * JWT authorization.
   *
   * This login operation authenticates a system administrator using the
   * todo_list_system_admins schema. The table provides email as the unique
   * login identifier and password_hash for credential verification. Only
   * administrators whose records have deleted_at set to null are eligible to
   * authenticate, ensuring deactivated accounts cannot log in. The service must
   * not expose whether an email exists; responses should remain neutral while
   * still enforcing correctness.
   *
   * Implementation must normalize the incoming email to lowercase before lookup
   * and compare the supplied password to password_hash using a strong password
   * verifier corresponding to the chosen hash algorithm. The operation must
   * update no persistent fields during a normal login, though a separate audit
   * system may record access events outside of this schema. Successful
   * authentication results in issuing JWTs and returning an authorization DTO
   * for the admin identity rather than the raw database entity.
   *
   * This endpoint is role-specific to systemAdmin, aligning with administrative
   * responsibilities without implying access to private member Todo content.
   * The login result embodies permissions appropriate to administrators in the
   * Minimal Todo List service.
   *
   * Security considerations include consistently rejecting invalid credentials,
   * preventing enumeration by using consistent timing/error messages, and
   * denying access when deleted_at is non-null. The underlying Prisma model’s
   * @@unique([email]) ensures a single record per email.
   *
   * Related operations include registration (join) to create the admin account
   * and refresh to renew tokens before expiry. Clients will typically call
   * login after a join or whenever a new session is needed.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Admin login credentials to authenticate (email and password).

  /**
   * Refresh JWT credentials for a system administrator after validating the
   * refresh token and account state in todo_list_system_admins.
   *
   * This operation renews an existing authenticated session for a system
   * administrator without re-supplying primary credentials. While tokens are
   * typically validated independently of the database, the service should
   * ensure the referenced administrator still exists in todo_list_system_admins
   * and remains active (deleted_at is null) before issuing new tokens. This
   * aligns token lifecycle with the authoritative account state defined by the
   * Prisma model.
   *
   * Implementation accepts a refresh token in the request body, validates its
   * integrity and expiry, and, on success, generates a fresh access token (and,
   * if applicable, a rotated refresh token). No changes are made to fields in
   * todo_list_system_admins during a standard refresh; created_at and
   * updated_at remain as originally persisted. The id and email from the admin
   * record inform claims appropriate to the systemAdmin role.
   *
   * The endpoint’s role context is systemAdmin, ensuring that the renewed
   * session continues to carry administrator permissions relevant to
   * service-level actions and excluding routine access to private member Todo
   * content.
   *
   * Security considerations include invalidating refresh tokens when
   * deactivation occurs (deleted_at non-null), enforcing token rotation
   * policies where applicable, and returning neutral errors on invalid or
   * expired tokens. Validation should be performed without leaking whether a
   * given token corresponds to a specific account.
   *
   * Related operations are login for initial credential-based authentication
   * and join for first-time account creation. Clients should prefer refresh
   * prior to token expiry to maintain a consistent administrative session.
