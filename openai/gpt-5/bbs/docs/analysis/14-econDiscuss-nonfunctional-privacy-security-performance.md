# econDiscuss Non-Functional Requirements: Privacy, Security, Compliance, Performance, Scalability & Availability

The requirements in this specification govern the econDiscuss platform end-to-end, including profiles and expertise verification, bookmarks and voting history, advanced search and trending, polls and sentiment, real-time discussions and notifications, drafts, follows/subscriptions, and the reputation system. All statements are business-level, implementation-agnostic, and expressed in testable terms using EARS.

## 1) Scope and Principles
- THE econDiscuss platform SHALL uphold professional discourse quality and user trust through rigorous, measurable non-functional standards applied uniformly across all features and roles.
- THE econDiscuss platform SHALL avoid prescriptive technical choices, allowing the development team to select architectures and vendors that satisfy these requirements.
- WHERE conflicts arise between functionality and privacy/security, THE econDiscuss platform SHALL favor user safety and lawful processing.

## 2) Data Classification & Privacy Defaults
### 2.1 Data Categories (Business Definitions)
- Personal Data (PII): email address, display name, profile images, affiliation statements, IP/session metadata.
- Sensitive Personal Data: government IDs, phone numbers, recovery codes, legal identity documents submitted during verification.
- Public Content: published posts/comments, public profiles, public topic follows, featured items.
- Private Content: drafts, bookmarks/collections (unless the owner shares), voting history (to the voter only), private moderation notes.
- Derived Data: reputation scores, trending signals, abuse risk scores, engagement aggregates.

EARS
- THE econDiscuss platform SHALL maintain and publish a data classification inventory describing categories, examples, and default visibility.
- THE econDiscuss platform SHALL minimize collection of Sensitive Personal Data and restrict its processing to verification, security, and legal obligations.

### 2.2 Visibility Defaults
- Profiles: badges and display names are public by default; emails and legal identities are private.
- Voting: individual vote choices are private to the voter; only aggregates are public.
- Bookmarks/Collections: private by default; collection-level sharing requires explicit opt-in by the owner.
- Drafts: private to the author; visible to staff only where policy requires.

EARS
- THE econDiscuss platform SHALL default bookmarks/collections to private, voting histories to private-to-self, and drafts to private.
- WHERE a user opts to share a collection, THE econDiscuss platform SHALL expose a read-only view without private notes and SHALL allow revocation at any time.
- WHERE poll results are segmented, THE econDiscuss platform SHALL suppress any segment that does not meet minimum k-thresholds to protect anonymity.

### 2.3 Data Subject Rights (DSR)
EARS
- WHEN a user requests data export, THE econDiscuss platform SHALL provide a machine-readable export within 15 calendar days after verifying identity.
- WHEN a user requests deletion, THE econDiscuss platform SHALL delete or irreversibly pseudonymize personal data within 30 calendar days, subject to legal holds and safety exceptions.
- WHEN a user requests correction or portability, THE econDiscuss platform SHALL complete within 30 calendar days after identity verification.
