### `econ_discuss_polls`

Poll entity attached to a post with explicit support for multiple
question types (single choice, multiple choice, Likert, ranking, numeric
estimate), visibility modes, expert-only eligibility, vote-change policy,
and per-type configuration. One-to-one with [econ_discuss_posts](#econ_discuss_posts).
Options are stored in [econ_discuss_poll_options](#econ_discuss_poll_options). Responses reside
in [econ_discuss_poll_responses](#econ_discuss_poll_responses) with selections in {@link
econ_discuss_poll_response_options} for multi-select and ranking.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `econ_discuss_post_id`: Host post's [econ_discuss_posts.id](#econ_discuss_posts). Exactly one poll per post.
- `question`: Poll prompt shown to voters.
- `question_type`
  > Type of question: single_choice, multiple_choice, likert, ranking,
  > numeric_estimate. Application enforces valid values.
- `visibility_mode`
  > Visibility mode: hidden_until_close (default), visible_after_vote,
  > always_visible (policy may disallow for expert-only).
- `expert_only`: Whether voting/participation is restricted to verified experts and staff.
- `allow_vote_change`
  > Whether respondents may change their vote prior to poll closure. Default
  > business policy: enabled.
- `min_voter_reputation`
  > Optional minimum voter reputation required to participate (members below
  > are ineligible).
- `min_account_age_hours`: Optional minimum account age in hours for eligibility (e.g., 48).
- `min_selections`: For multiple_choice: minimum number of selections required.
- `max_selections`
  > For multiple_choice: maximum number of selections allowed (â‰¤ number of
  > options).
- `scale_points`: For likert: number of scale points (commonly 5 or 7).
- `scale_min_label`: For likert: label for the minimum endpoint.
- `scale_max_label`: For likert: label for the maximum endpoint.
- `scale_mid_label`: For likert: optional midpoint label.
- `unit_label`: For numeric_estimate: unit label (e.g., %, index points).
- `numeric_min`: For numeric_estimate: minimum allowed value.
- `numeric_max`: For numeric_estimate: maximum allowed value.
- `numeric_step`: For numeric_estimate: step size/precision for rounding.
- `start_at`: Scheduled start time when the poll opens for responses (optional).
- `end_at`: Scheduled end time after which responses are closed (optional).
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp for audit and ordering.
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp for audit and cache invalidation.
- `deleted_at`
  > Soft deletion timestamp. When set, the poll is considered removed from
  > active use.

### `econ_discuss_poll_options`

Answer options for a given poll. Each option belongs to one {@link
econ_discuss_polls} and participates in per-poll uniqueness and display
ordering. Managed through the parent poll lifecycle.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `econ_discuss_poll_id`: Owner poll's [econ_discuss_polls.id](#econ_discuss_polls).
- `option_text`: Display text for the option. Must be unique within the same poll.
- `position`
  > Zero- or one-based position for deterministic display ordering within a
  > poll.
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp.
- `deleted_at`: Soft deletion timestamp to retire an option without losing history.

### `econ_discuss_poll_responses`

One response per (poll, user) capturing lifecycle status, timestamps, and
type-specific values. Option selections are recorded in {@link
econ_discuss_poll_response_options} to support multiple choice and
ranking. Likert responses use likert_value; numeric estimate uses
numeric_value. Withdrawals and integrity actions are modeled via status
and withdrawn_at.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `econ_discuss_poll_id`: Target poll's [econ_discuss_polls.id](#econ_discuss_polls).
- `econ_discuss_user_id`: Respondent user's [econ_discuss_users.id](#econ_discuss_users).
- `status`
  > Response status: active, withdrawn, quarantined, invalidated. Used for
  > moderation and integrity flows.
- `likert_value`: For likert: selected integer value within the defined scale points.
- `numeric_value`: For numeric_estimate: submitted numeric value (unit and bounds on poll).
- `withdrawn_at`: Timestamp when the respondent withdrew their vote (if applicable).
- `created_at`
  > Response creation timestamp used for user history and time-window
  > analytics.
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp (e.g., when editing within allowed window).
- `deleted_at`
  > Soft deletion timestamp. When set, the response is removed from active
  > tallies; moderation may also use status to indicate reason.

### `econ_discuss_poll_response_options`

Junction table linking a response to one or more options, enabling
multiple choice and ranking support. When ranking is used, the position
field stores the order assigned by the respondent (1 = highest). For
single-choice questions, there will be exactly one row per response.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `econ_discuss_poll_response_id`: Linked response's [econ_discuss_poll_responses.id](#econ_discuss_poll_responses).
- `econ_discuss_poll_option_id`: Selected option's [econ_discuss_poll_options.id](#econ_discuss_poll_options).
- `position`: For ranking questions: position order (1..N). Null for non-ranking types.
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp for the selection record.
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp for the selection record.
- `deleted_at`: Soft deletion timestamp to remove a selection without losing audit trail.

### `econ_discuss_live_threads`

Represents a live discussion thread (room) attached to a specific post.
One-to-one with [econ_discuss_posts](#econ_discuss_posts). Tracks lifecycle state
(scheduled, waiting, live, paused, ended, archived), configuration flags
(e.g., expert-only), access scope governance, and key timestamps for
operations. Messages are stored in [econ_discuss_live_messages](#econ_discuss_live_messages).

  > (application-enforced): scheduled, waiting, live, paused, ended,
