  /**
   * Search and paginate posts from econ_discuss_posts with rich filters and
   * sorting.
   *
   * This collection operation reads from econ_discuss_posts, which includes id
   * (UUID), econ_discuss_user_id (author), title, body, summary, published_at,
   * scheduled_publish_at, created_at, updated_at, and deleted_at. Results
   * exclude rows where deleted_at is not null and typically prefer published_at
   * for ordering when available. Topic filtering leverages
   * econ_discuss_post_topics (unique per post/topic), and expert-only filtering
   * is implemented by joining author ids to econ_discuss_verified_experts
   * (verified_at and optional badge_valid_until) to restrict results to
   * verified expert authors.
   *
   * The request body (IEconDiscussPost.IRequest) should provide pagination
   * fields (page, pageSize), free-text query, optional authorId, array of
   * topicIds, expertOnly boolean, dateFrom/dateTo targeting published_at, and
   * sort options such as new or trending. Trending may consider recent weighted
   * interactions using econ_discuss_post_votes (vote_type up/down and status)
   * alongside recency; exact ranking is provider-defined but consistent with
   * business policies. The response returns a paginated container
   * (IPageIEconDiscussPost.ISummary) optimized for list views, containing
   * summaries rather than full text where appropriate.
   *
   * Security-wise, this is a public read endpoint, so authorizationRole is
   * null. Validation enforces UUID formats for identifiers, ensures
   * page/pageSize bounds, normalizes date ranges, and rejects queries
   * referencing archived topics. Errors include 400 for invalid filters, 404
   * only when a strictly scoped filter yields a missing referenced entity, and
   * 429 when rate limits apply. Related endpoints include GET /posts/{id} to
   * fetch a single post and topic subscription operations that influence
   * personalization but not the search scope directly.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search, filter, and pagination parameters for post discovery.

  /**
   * Get a single post from econ_discuss_posts by ID.
   *
   * Retrieve a specific post from econ_discuss_posts using its UUID. The model
   * defines title, body, optional summary, publication timestamps
   * (published_at, scheduled_publish_at), and lifecycle timestamps (created_at,
   * updated_at). For public callers, only posts that are currently visible
   * should be returnedâ€”typically those with published_at set and deleted_at
   * null. Implementations may enforce exclusion of scheduled or hidden items
   * per policy.
   *
   * This operation relates to taxonomy and authoring: topic associations are in
   * econ_discuss_post_topics referencing econ_discuss_topics, and author
   * attribution uses econ_discuss_users via econ_discuss_user_id. Interaction
   * aggregates (votes/bookmarks) live in econ_discuss_post_votes and
   * econ_discuss_post_bookmarks, but they do not alter the core post entity.

   * not exist or is not visible to the caller.
