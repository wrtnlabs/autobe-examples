  /**
   * Create a new draft in econ_discuss_post_drafts for the authenticated user.
   *
   * This endpoint creates a new draft for long-form authoring using the
   * econ_discuss_post_drafts table. Per the schema comments, drafts are
   * private, autosaved artifacts that support cross-device workflows before
   * publication. The model provides optional title and body fields so early
   * autosave can occur before the author determines final content. Ownership is
   * recorded through econ_discuss_user_id and the created_at/updated_at
   * timestamps are populated for ordering and concurrency behaviors.
   *
   * Security and permissions follow the business rules: only authenticated
   * members may create drafts. The draft is private to the owner; it is not
   * discoverable through public content surfaces until published. The operation
   * writes to econ_discuss_post_drafts and does not touch publication entities
   * such as econ_discuss_posts. If a client needs to publish later, use the
   * dedicated publish endpoint which will create the post and link it back
   * using econ_discuss_post_id.
   *
   * The database relationship is explicit: econ_discuss_post_drafts.author
   * references econ_discuss_users, and an optional publishedPost relation
   * references econ_discuss_posts through econ_discuss_post_id. No soft
   * deletion occurs during creation; however, the model supports soft deletion
   * via deleted_at for future discard operations.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: title and body are optional in the draft
   * stage by design (see schema comments) to support early autosave. Clients
   * typically include minimal fields on first save and expand during editing.
   * The API must ensure the created draft belongs to the authenticated user by
   * setting econ_discuss_user_id accordingly.
   *
   * Related operations: clients usually call PUT /drafts/{draftId} to update
   * content, DELETE /drafts/{draftId} to discard via soft deletion, and POST
   * /drafts/{draftId}/publish to create a post from the draft. Error handling
   * includes 401 for unauthenticated requests and 429 per platform rate limits
   * during burst autosaves.

   *
   * Security and permissions: only authenticated users may access their own
   * drafts. Business rules should ensure that records are filtered by
   * econ_discuss_user_id matching the requester. The endpoint supports advanced
   * search use cases such as partial title matching (leveraging trigram indexes
   * on title/body noted in schema), updated_at ranges for recent work, and
   * default sorting by updated_at desc unless otherwise specified in the
   * request body.
   *
   * Validation and behavior: the request body IEconDiscussPostDraft.IRequest
   * should include pagination properties (page, pageSize) and optional filters
   * such as q (keyword against title/body), updatedFrom/updatedTo (ISO 8601),
   * and publishedLink (boolean indicating whether econ_discuss_post_id is
