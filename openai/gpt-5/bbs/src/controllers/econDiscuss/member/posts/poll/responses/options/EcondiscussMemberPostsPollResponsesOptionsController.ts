   * Fetch a single poll response option entry associated with a respondent’s
   * selection. According to the Prisma schema,
   * econ_discuss_poll_response_options is a junction table that links a
   * response (econ_discuss_poll_responses.id) to one selected option
   * (econ_discuss_poll_options.id), with an optional position field used when
   * the question type is ranking. Each row represents either one of multiple
   * selections (multiple_choice) or the sole selection (single_choice), and
   * persists even if the author’s account is anonymized, per auditability rules
   * in the schema comments.
   *
   * Security and privacy considerations: the schema for
   * econ_discuss_poll_responses explicitly models response status states
   * (active, withdrawn, quarantined, invalidated), and the platform’s business
   * rules require that individual selections are private. Implementations must
   * restrict access so that only the response owner (econ_discuss_users.id
   * matching the authenticated user), or authorized moderation/admin roles, can
   * read raw selection rows. This endpoint should therefore be protected for
   * authenticated users and perform ownership checks; public aggregation is
   * exposed via the separate results endpoint.
   *
   * Entity relationships: the path requires a valid postId that owns a poll
   * (econ_discuss_polls with unique econ_discuss_post_id), then a responseId
   * that belongs to that poll (econ_discuss_poll_responses with unique
   * (poll,user)), then a responseOptionId that belongs to that response
   * (econ_discuss_poll_response_options). The provider should verify these
   * relationships to prevent IDOR issues. The returned object corresponds to
   * IEconDiscussPollResponseOption, reflecting fields from
   * econ_discuss_poll_response_options (ids, foreign keys, position,
   * created_at/updated_at).
   *
   * Validation and errors: return 404 if the response or option does not exist
   * under the specified post’s poll; 403 if the caller is not permitted to see
   * raw response content; 409 if state prohibits reading (e.g., response
   * invalidated and hidden by policy). Timestamps are ISO 8601 strings; follow
