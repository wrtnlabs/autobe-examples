  /**
   * List public curated topics from econ_discuss_topics with pagination.
   *
   * This operation reads from the econ_discuss_topics table, which the Prisma
   * schema describes as a curated taxonomy of economics subjects used across
   * the platform. The table defines a unique code (immutable slug-like
   * identifier), a human-readable name, optional description, and temporal
   * columns (created_at, updated_at). The deleted_at column indicates a record
   * is retired from active use and should not appear in user-facing lists.
   * Clients should expect that only records with a null deleted_at value are
   * returned.
   *
   * Security-wise, this is a public discovery endpoint that does not require
   * authentication. Administrative creation and maintenance of topics are
   * handled by separate restricted endpoints. Consumers can cache responses
   * briefly; however, administrators may update topic names or descriptions, so
   * clients should handle eventual consistency.
   *
   * In relation to other database entities, topics are referenced by
   * econ_discuss_post_topics (post-to-topic junction),
   * econ_discuss_user_topic_subscriptions (user subscriptions), and
   * econ_discuss_expert_domain_badges (per-domain expert badges). Changes in
   * topics may affect discovery and personalization surfaces. The list endpoint
   * is optimized for read scenarios and can be paired with GET
   * /topics/{topicId} for detailed retrieval.
   *
   * Validation and behavior: the endpoint returns a paginated container
   * (IPageIEconDiscussTopic). Although pagination and search filters are
   * implemented at the application level, the response always conforms to the
   * page wrapper. Server-side errors include 500 for unexpected failures. If
   * the catalog is empty, the data array is empty with appropriate pagination
   * metadata.

  /**
   * Search/paginate topics (econ_discuss_topics) with keyword and sorting.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of economics topics for discovery
   * based on the econ_discuss_topics entity.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: Clients use this endpoint to power topic search,
   * selection dialogs, and topic pages. It supports free-text search across
   * name and description and returns a page of concise records.
   *
   * Security considerations: This endpoint is public read and does not require
   * authentication. It must only return non-archived topics by default (i.e.,
   * exclude records whose archival timestamp is set). Administrative creation
   * or modification of topics is out of scope here.
   *
   * Database relationship: The econ_discuss_topics table defines id (UUID PK),
   * code (unique slug), name, optional description, created/updated timestamps,
   * and an archival timestamp used to hide topics from user-facing lists. This
   * endpoint transforms those rows into summary DTOs suitable for list
   * presentation.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: Validate pagination bounds (page â‰¥ 1,
   * reasonable pageSize limits). Apply keyword filtering to name/description
   * fields. Sorting may include name asc/desc or recency by
   * created_at/updated_at. Exclude archived records by default, with no way to
   * include them via this public endpoint to avoid exposing retired topics.
   *
   * Related operations: Topic detail retrieval (e.g., GET /topics/{topicId})
   * and subscription endpoints are separate concerns. This endpoint focuses
   * solely on list/search.

   * @param body Search, pagination, and sorting parameters for topics listing

  /**
   * Get a single topic from econ_discuss_topics by its UUID.
   *
   * This operation targets the econ_discuss_topics table, which holds the
   * curated taxonomy used throughout the platform. The schema defines the
   * following notable columns: id (UUID primary key), code (unique slug-like
   * business identifier), name (display name), description (optional),
   * created_at, updated_at, and an archival marker deleted_at. When deleted_at
   * is non-null, the record is considered retired from active use and should
   * not be served to end users.
   *
   * Authorization: public read access. Administrative writes occur through
   * restricted endpoints. The operation should be safe to use across pages that
   * need to show topic details, including topic pages and post authoring
   * flows.
   *
   * Relationships: topics are joined from econ_discuss_post_topics for
   * filtering posts, from econ_discuss_user_topic_subscriptions for
   * personalization, and from econ_discuss_expert_domain_badges for expert
   * domain badges. If the requested topic does not exist or is retired, the
   * server returns 404. Validation consists of verifying that the provided
   * topicId is a valid UUID and that the record is present and active.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param topicId Unique identifier of the target topic.
