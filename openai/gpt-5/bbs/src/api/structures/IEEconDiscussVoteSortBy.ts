 * Use createdAt to order results by econ_discuss_post_votes.created_at,

 * by econ_discuss_post_votes.updated_at, capturing the most recent lifecycle
 * transition (e.g., switched, withdrawn).
 *
 * The values map directly to Prisma timestamps on the vote table to ensure
 * deterministic ordering without adâ€‘hoc field names.
