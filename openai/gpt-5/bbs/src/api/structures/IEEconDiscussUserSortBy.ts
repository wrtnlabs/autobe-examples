/**
 * User/followee sort keys for discovery and relationship listings.
 *
 * Allowed values:
 *
 * - Created_at: sort by creation time of the relationship or user record
 *   depending on context.
 * - Display_name: sort by econ_discuss_users.display_name (GIN trigram index
 *   supports search/sort operations).
 * - Reputation: sort by derived score from econ_discuss_user_reputations.score
 *   when exposed by the endpoint.
 *
 * Schema alignment:
 *
 * - Display_name maps to econ_discuss_users.display_name
 * - Created_at maps to either econ_discuss_user_follows.created_at or
 *   econ_discuss_users.created_at per endpoint semantics
 * - Reputation is derived from econ_discuss_user_reputations.score
