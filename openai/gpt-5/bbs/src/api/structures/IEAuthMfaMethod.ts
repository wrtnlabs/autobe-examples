/**
 * Multi-factor authentication method enumeration for enrollment and
 * verification flows.
 *
 * Permitted value:
 *
 * - Totp: Time-based One-Time Password using a shared secret stored
 *   (encrypted/managed) in Actors.econ_discuss_users.mfa_secret and one-time
 *   recovery codes hashed/encrypted in
 *   Actors.econ_discuss_users.mfa_recovery_codes. Clients submit TOTP or
 *   recovery codes for verification; secrets are never returned in responses.
 *
 * This enum is used by authentication endpoints to indicate the factor method
 * in use. Additional methods (e.g., WebAuthn) can be added in the future by
 * extending this enumeration without breaking existing contracts.
