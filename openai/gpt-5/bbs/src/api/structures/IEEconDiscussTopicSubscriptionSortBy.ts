/**
 * Sort keys for listing a user’s topic subscriptions that join

 *
 * Use createdAt to order by the subscription’s creation timestamp in
 * econ_discuss_user_topic_subscriptions.created_at. Use name to order by the
 * curated topic’s human‑readable name in econ_discuss_topics.name.
 *
 * This enumeration supports default and user‑selected ordering modes in
 * list/search endpoints. It does not alter data; it only defines permitted sort
 * fields aligned with the underlying Prisma columns.
