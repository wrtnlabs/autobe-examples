/**
 * Validate community creation rejects invalid values while honoring allowed
 * visibility set.
 *
 * Background and constraints:
 *
 * - Visibility is strictly typed as IECommunityVisibility ("public" |
 *   "restricted" | "private"). Therefore, attempting to send an invalid
 *   visibility like "hidden" is a compile-time error and MUST NOT be tested by
 *   breaking type safety.
 *
 * Test flow (type-safe rewrite for invalid case):
 *
 * 1. Join as a member user to obtain an authenticated session.
 * 2. Attempt to create a community with auto_archive_days < 30 (business rule
 *    violation) and expect an error. This validates server-side input
 *    constraints without violating types.
 * 3. Create a community with the SAME name but valid fields to confirm no record
 *    was created by the failed attempt (name uniqueness guarantees this
 *    check).
 * 4. Additionally, create one community for each allowed visibility value (public,
 *    restricted, private) to ensure the allowed set is accepted.
