/**
 * Community visibility mode as stored in Prisma model
 * community_platform_communities.visibility.
 *
 * Allowed values reflect business access semantics:
 *
 * - Public: Anyone can view; participation may still require eligibility.
 * - Restricted: Readable by all, but posting/commenting restricted per community
 *   policy.
 * - Private: Membership approval required to view and participate.
 *
 * This enum supplies a stable vocabulary for API schemas; the underlying Prisma
 * column is a String field constrained by application logic.
