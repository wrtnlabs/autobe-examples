/**
 * Enumerated status values representing high-level outcomes for administrator
 * email verification flows.
 *
 * This enumeration summarizes results for either an email verification
 * confirmation or a resend request without exposing sensitive internals.
 *
 * - Verified: The administrator’s email has been successfully verified during
 *   this operation.
 * - Already_verified: The administrator’s email was already verified prior to
 *   this operation.
 * - Sent: A verification email has been (re)sent successfully to the
 *   administrator.
 *
 * Business context: These outcomes align with lifecycle semantics stored on
 * community_platform_users (email_verified boolean and account_state string).
 * This is a response-layer construct and does not map directly to any Prisma
 * column.
