# 02 ‚Äì User Roles and Permissions Requirements (shoppingMall)

Business requirements for authentication, authorization, user roles, and permissions for the shoppingMall platform. Describes WHAT must happen in business terms; technical details (APIs, schemas, vendor endpoints, UI) are intentionally excluded. JWT/session behaviors are expressed in business language to remove ambiguity for backend developers.

## 1. Introduction and Scope
- Purpose: Define authentication concepts, sessions, roles, permission boundaries, evaluation principles, address/identity rules, audit/compliance, and performance targets for access control.
- Audience: Backend developers, QA, product managers, operations and security stakeholders.
- Scope: All business rules determining who may perform which action, under which conditions, and with what validations. Out of scope: UI layouts, database design, API specifications, or infrastructure choices.

## 2. Authentication Concepts and Sessions

### 2.1 Core Authentication Functions
- THE shoppingMall platform SHALL support: registration, login, logout, email verification, password reset, password change, session revocation, and optional two-factor authentication (2FA).
- THE shoppingMall platform SHALL support guest sessions and authenticated sessions with clear upgrade from guest to customer upon login/registration.
- THE shoppingMall platform SHALL treat checkout, payout, role assignment, and policy changes as high-risk actions that may require step-up verification.

### 2.2 JWT Token Management (Business Requirements)
- THE shoppingMall platform SHALL issue access and refresh tokens using JWT semantics in business terms.
- THE access token SHALL expire within 20 minutes of issuance.
- THE refresh token SHALL expire within 14 days of issuance.
- THE JWT payload SHALL include userId, role, effective permissions, and where applicable sellerId for seller accounts.
- WHEN role or permissions change materially (e.g., seller onboarding approved, admin promotion), THE shoppingMall platform SHALL invalidate outstanding refresh tokens and require fresh login.
- WHEN a password is changed or account recovery completes, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL revoke all existing sessions and refresh tokens immediately.
- IF a refresh token is invalid, expired, or revoked, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL deny refresh and require interactive login.
- WHERE 2FA is enabled, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL require a valid second factor at login and before high-risk actions.

### 2.3 Sessions and Devices
- THE shoppingMall platform SHALL allow concurrent sessions across devices and SHALL track device metadata for audit and security notifications.
- WHERE an account is flagged for risk (unusual geo/velocity), THE shoppingMall platform SHALL require step-up verification before granting access.
- WHEN a user logs out, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL invalidate the corresponding access token and revoke its refresh token immediately.

### 2.4 Email Verification and Password Policies
- WHEN a user registers by email, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL send a verification message and mark the account as unverified until successful verification.
- IF an unverified user attempts actions requiring verified identity (e.g., placing an order), THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL block the action and prompt verification.
- THE password policy SHALL require a minimum length of 10 characters and a mix of character classes per business policy.
- IF failed login attempts exceed 10 within 10 minutes, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL rate-limit or lock the account for 15 minutes.

### 2.5 Error Handling and Messaging (Authentication)
- IF credentials are invalid, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL respond with an authentication failure message without revealing which field was incorrect.
- IF the account is temporarily locked, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL inform the user of remaining lockout duration.
- WHEN a password reset is initiated, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL send a reset link valid for 30 minutes.

## 3. Role Hierarchy and Kinds

### 3.1 Role Kinds
- guest (kind: guest)
- customer (kind: member)
- seller (kind: member)
- supportAgent (kind: admin)
- operationsManager (kind: admin)
- financeManager (kind: admin)
- contentModerator (kind: admin)
- systemAdmin (kind: admin)

### 3.2 Principles (Least-Privilege and Separation of Duties)
- THE shoppingMall platform SHALL enforce least-privilege: roles receive only necessary permissions.
- THE shoppingMall platform SHALL avoid implicit inheritance across roles unless explicitly defined by policy.
- WHERE financial, privacy, or platform-integrity risk exists, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL require admin roles with scoped authority and, where configured, maker-checker approvals.

## 4. Role Definitions and Capabilities

### 4.1 guest (guest)
- Browses catalog and product details; reads reviews.
- Creates a transient cart and device-scoped wishlist; cannot checkout by default.
- May register and verify an account.

EARS examples:
- WHEN a guest browses, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL allow search, filter, and sort within public catalog rules.
- IF a guest attempts checkout, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL require registration/login.

### 4.2 customer (member)
- Manages profile and addresses; maintains persistent cart and wishlist.
- Places orders, pays, tracks shipments; views order history.
- Initiates cancellations and refund requests per policy.
- Submits reviews and ratings per eligibility rules.

EARS examples:
- WHEN a customer places an order, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL validate a verified email and at least one valid shipping address.
- IF a customer attempts to access another user‚Äôs order, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL deny access.
- WHILE a customer is logged in, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL persist wishlist and cart server-side and sync across sessions.

### 4.3 seller (member)
- Manages store profile, products/SKUs, inventory, pricing, and promotions.
- Processes orders (own items), updates shipping status, and handles cancellations/refunds.
- Views performance metrics and payout summaries for own store.

EARS examples:
- WHEN a seller updates inventory for a SKU, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL constrain the change to SKUs owned by that seller.
- IF a seller attempts to modify another seller‚Äôs product, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL deny the change.
- WHILE an order contains multiple sellers, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL limit each seller‚Äôs view to their own line items.

### 4.4 supportAgent (admin)
- Views and manages customer orders within thresholds; assists with cancellations/refunds and disputes.

EARS examples:
- WHEN a supportAgent processes a customer cancellation within policy, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL allow order or line-level cancellation subject to payment state.
- IF a supportAgent attempts a refund above threshold, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL require financeManager approval.

### 4.5 operationsManager (admin)
- Oversees catalog integrity, categories, policy enforcement, feature flags, and order monitoring.

EARS examples:
- WHEN an operationsManager archives a category, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL ensure no active products remain unassigned.
- IF an operationsManager changes a policy with financial impact, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL require maker-checker approval by financeManager or systemAdmin.

### 4.6 financeManager (admin)
- Approves and processes refunds and chargebacks; manages payouts and reconciliation; views/export financial reports.

EARS examples:
- WHEN a financeManager approves a refund, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL capture a reason code and link the approval to the initiator in the audit trail.
- IF a financeManager modifies seller payout banking details, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL require verification steps and dual control where configured.

### 4.7 contentModerator (admin)
- Moderates reviews and seller-generated content per policy.

EARS examples:
- WHEN a contentModerator flags a review as violating policy, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL hide it from public view and retain it for audit.
- IF a contentModerator removes content, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL notify the content owner with policy references.

### 4.8 systemAdmin (admin)
- Manages users and roles; has global configuration authority under audit.

EARS examples:
- WHEN a systemAdmin assigns or revokes roles, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL update effective permissions immediately and invalidate tokens as required.
- IF a systemAdmin exports audit logs, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL enforce export constraints and record the export with justification.

## 5. Permission Evaluation Principles
- THE shoppingMall platform SHALL evaluate authorization using role, explicit permissions, resource ownership, data sensitivity, and policy configuration.
- WHERE ownership applies, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL match requester identity (userId or sellerId) to the resource owner identifiers.
- WHEN multiple policies apply, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL apply the most restrictive policy unless a higher-priority exception is configured.
- IF no policy grants access, THEN THE shoppingMall platform SHALL deny by default.
- WHERE time/state constraints apply (e.g., cancellation windows), THE shoppingMall platform SHALL enforce them consistently.

Performance target:
- WHEN a user requests access to a resource, THE shoppingMall platform SHALL decide within 100 ms under normal load.
