/**
 * Test deletion of a specific moderation report action by a community moderator
 * user.
 *
 * Business Context: A community moderator user must be able to delete
 * moderation report actions associated with reports in their managed
 * communities. The test ensures proper role authentication and access control.
 * The workflow involves multiple authenticated roles: community moderator,
 * admin, and member.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Community moderator user joins and logs in.
 * 2. Admin user joins and logs in.
 * 3. Member user joins and logs in.
 * 4. Admin creates a report status to associate with reports.
 * 5. Member creates a community.
 * 6. Member creates a post in the community.
 * 7. Member creates a comment on the post.
 * 8. Member creates a report about the post using the created report status.
 * 9. Admin assigns the community moderator to the community.
 * 10. Community moderator creates a moderation report action on the report.
 * 11. Community moderator deletes the report action.
 * 12. Confirm the delete operation succeeds without error.
 *
 * The test ensures that only authorized community moderators can delete report
 * actions.
