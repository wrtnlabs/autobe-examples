/**
 * E2E test for Admin Deletion of RedditCommunity Moderation Report Action
 *
 * This test covers a multi-role workflow validating that an authenticated admin
 * user can delete a specific moderation report action associated with a user
 * report. It performs the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Admin user registration and authentication
 * 2. Member user registration and authentication
 * 3. Community creation by member
 * 4. Community post creation by member
 * 5. Comment creation on the post by member
 * 6. Creation of a report status for moderation states
 * 7. Creation of a content report referring to the post
 * 8. Assign member as a community moderator
 * 9. Creation of a moderation report action linked to report, moderator, and admin
 * 10. Admin deletes the specific report action
 *
 * Each step calls the corresponding API and validates responses fully,
 * including type assertions and value consistency checks. The test ensures that
 * only admins can successfully delete report actions and that the deletion
 * succeeds without error.
 *
 * Random realistic data is used to simulate genuine business conditions.
