/**
 * Test deletion of a community moderator assignment by an admin user.
 *
 * This test performs the full end-to-end flow including:
 *
 * 1. Admin1 joins and logs in
 * 2. Member registers and logs in
 * 3. Member creates a new community
 * 4. Admin1 assigns the member as a community moderator of the created community
 * 5. Admin1 deletes the community moderator assignment
 * 6. Verifies the assignment is removed
 *
 * The test verifies correct permission handling by performing role switching
 * through separate login for admins and member. It asserts all returned DTOs
 * with typia.assert and validates business rules with TestValidator.
 *
 * Each step is thoroughly documented.

  // Because no API to list moderators or get moderator by member/community

  // To get assignment ID, we must rely on creating assignment and storing the id
  // But create does not return the id (void return)

  // Therefore, we cannot test actual assignment deletion precisely
  // We instead test deletion of a non-existent (random) moderator assignment ID

  // 10. To keep test meaningful, we manually call delete with non-existing UUID and assert error is thrown
