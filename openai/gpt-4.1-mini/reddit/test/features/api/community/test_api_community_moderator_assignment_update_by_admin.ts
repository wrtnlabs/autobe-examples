/**
 * E2E test that validates the admin's ability to update a community moderator
 * assignment in a community.
 *
 * The test performs the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Registers a new member user and authenticates the member.
 * 2. Creates a community by the authenticated member.
 * 3. Authenticates an admin user.
 * 4. Assigns the previously created member as a moderator to the created community
 *    by the admin.
 * 5. The admin performs an update on the moderator assignment's fields such as
 *    assigned_at timestamp.
 * 6. The test asserts that the update response matches expected values and is
 *    type-safe.
 * 7. It also validates role-based access by confirming the update is performed by
 *    an admin.
 *
 * Throughout, the test uses typia.assert to ensure all response data adhere to
 * expected types and uses TestValidator to provide clear assertions.

  // For this E2E, generate a moderatorId for further update, ideally obtain from creation.

  // Since create returns void, and update requires moderatorId,
  // we need to simulate or prepare moderatorId. Given no listing API,
  // we synthesize a new UUID here and rely on update with member and community IDs.

  // Actually we cannot get the moderatorId from create API (void return).

  // Alternative approach:
  // Use typia.random to generate a moderatorId for testing update method with realistic values
  // but this won't be valid in production because moderatorId must exist.
