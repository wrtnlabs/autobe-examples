/**
 * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of redditCommunity community
 * moderators.
 *
 * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of redditCommunity community
 * moderators from the system. This operation allows clients to query moderators
 * assigned to various communities with capabilities to filter and sort results
 * based on member IDs, community IDs, and assignment timestamps.
 *
 * Security considerations restrict this operation to administrative users or
 * community personnel with sufficient privileges to view moderation
 * assignments. Unauthorized users should not access detailed moderator data.
 *
 * This operation maps to the reddit_community_community_moderators table in the
 * Prisma schema. The moderators represent members (users) assigned moderation
 * roles within communities, including the timestamp they were assigned. The
 * response includes key identifiers and timestamps useful for management and
 * auditing.
 *
 * Validation rules require the request body to include pagination parameters
 * and optional filters. The response returns corresponding moderator summaries
 * with paging information.
 *
 * Related operations include retrieval of individual moderators by ID,
 * creation, updating, and deletion of moderator assignments.
 *
 * Errors related to invalid filters, pagination parameters, or access
 * violations are handled explicitly in the API implementation.
