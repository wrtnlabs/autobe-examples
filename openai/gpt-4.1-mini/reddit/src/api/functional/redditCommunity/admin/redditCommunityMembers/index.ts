/**
 * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of reddit community members.
 *
 * Retrieve and search through reddit community members with filtering,
 * pagination, and sorting capabilities.
 *
 * This operation enables clients to specify detailed search criteria such as
 * filtering by email, verification status, and creation date ranges, allowing
 * efficient querying of member accounts. The query supports pagination for
 * manageable data retrieval and sorts results to meet various viewing
 * requirements.
 *
 * Security considerations include restricting access to admin and moderator
 * roles to protect sensitive member information. Unauthorized users cannot
 * perform this operation.
 *
 * The operation interacts directly with the reddit_community_members table in
 * the database, which stores member authentication and account status details.
 * It filters results based on the existing fields such as email,
 * is_email_verified, and timestamps.
 *
 * Validation rules include ensuring supplied filter parameters conform to valid
 * formats such as correct email patterns and ISO date-time standards.
 *
 * Related operations include retrieving single member details (`GET
 * /redditCommunityMembers/{id}`) and member account management endpoints.
 *
 * Error handling covers invalid filter parameters, unauthorized access, and
 * general server errors.
