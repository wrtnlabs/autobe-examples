/**
 * Search and retrieve paginated summary of redditCommunity guests.
 *
 * This operation provides the capability to search and retrieve a paginated
 * list of redditCommunity guests from the system. Guests represent
 * unauthenticated visitors who have session tracking within the platform.
 *
 * The operation accepts search criteria including session identifiers, IP
 * addresses, and creation dates to filter guests appropriately. It also
 * supports pagination and sorting to efficiently handle potentially large
 * datasets.
 *
 * Security considerations include restricting access to this operation to
 * administrative roles only due to the potentially sensitive nature of guest
 * session data. Public or regular user access is not permitted.
 *
 * This operation connects to the reddit_community_guests database table as
 * defined in the Prisma schema. It returns summarized guest records including
 * session_id and IP address but excludes sensitive user agent details unless
 * authorized.
 *
 * Clients can use this to monitor guest activity, security auditing, and
 * performance analysis. The implementation must ensure compliance with data
 * privacy standards when handling user agent and IP information.

 *
 * This operation relates directly to the `reddit_community_guests` table in the
 * database, which enforces uniqueness on sessionId and has indexes on IP
 * address and creation timestamp.
 *
 * Inputs requiring validation:
 *
 * - Path parameter `id`: must be a valid UUID corresponding to an existing guest
 * - Request body: must comply with input schema for guest updates
 *
 * Expected errors include 404 for unknown guest ID, 400 for invalid input, and
