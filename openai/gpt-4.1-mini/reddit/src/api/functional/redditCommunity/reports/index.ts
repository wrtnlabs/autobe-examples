/**
 * Create a content moderation report for posts, comments, or users.
 *
 * Create a report about a post, comment, or user in the redditCommunity
 * platform for content moderation purposes.
 *
 * This operation allows both guests and authenticated members to submit
 * reports. Guests must provide their guest ID if available. Members provide
 * their member ID. Reports can reference the content being reported by post ID,
 * comment ID, or user ID.
 *
 * The report category must be specified following the allowed types such as
 * spam, abuse, or other violation categories. An optional description can
 * provide additional context for moderators.
 *
 * Security checks ensure only valid identifiers and statuses are accepted.
 * Successful creation results in a report record with creation timestamp and
 * initial status.
 *
 * Related operations include updating report status or assigning moderators to
 * reports.
 *
 * Errors occur if required fields are missing or identifiers do not exist in
 * the system. Validation enforces proper data types and formats.
