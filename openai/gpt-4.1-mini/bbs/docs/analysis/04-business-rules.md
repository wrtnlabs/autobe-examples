# Business Rules and Validation Logic for Economic/Political Discussion Board

## 1. Introduction
This document provides detailed business rules and validation logic governing the economic and political discussion board. It defines precise, measurable constraints and workflows to enable backend developers to implement robust management of content, user moderation, and compliance with community standards.

## 2. Content Length Limits

### 2.1 Post Length Requirements
WHEN a user creates a new discussion post, THE system SHALL enforce that the post content length is at least 20 characters and no more than 2000 characters.
IF the submitted post content violates these length constraints, THEN THE system SHALL reject the submission and respond with a clear error message specifying the minimum and maximum character limits.

### 2.2 Reply Length Requirements
WHEN a user submits a reply to an existing post, THE system SHALL enforce that the reply content length is at least 5 characters and no more than 1000 characters.
IF the submitted reply content violates these length constraints, THEN THE system SHALL reject the submission and respond with a clear error message specifying the minimum and maximum character limits.

## 3. Profanity Filtering Rules

WHEN a user submits post or reply content, THE system SHALL scan the submitted text for profane or inappropriate language using a predefined, regularly updated list of banned words.
IF the content contains profane language, THEN THE system SHALL reject the submission and notify the user that their content violates community guidelines and must be modified.
WHERE the content passes the profanity filter, THE system SHALL proceed with normal processing.

## 4. Post and Reply Moderation Rules

### 4.1 Moderator Privileges
WHEN a moderator reviews user-generated posts or replies, THE system SHALL allow the moderator to edit or delete any post or reply deemed inappropriate or violating community guidelines.
WHEN a moderator deletes a post, THE system SHALL also delete all replies associated with that post.
WHEN a moderator edits a post or reply, THE system SHALL log the modification event with moderator identity, timestamp, and changes made for audit purposes.

### 4.2 Post Approval Process
IF the discussion board is configured to require post approval before public visibility, THEN THE system SHALL mark new posts as "Pending Approval" status and make them invisible to general users until approved by a moderator.
WHEN a moderator approves a pending post, THE system SHALL change its status to "Public" and make it immediately visible.
WHEN a moderator rejects a pending post, THE system SHALL delete the post and notify the submitting user.

## 5. User Account Restrictions

### 5.1 Posting Permissions
WHEN a guest (unauthenticated user) attempts to create a post or reply, THEN THE system SHALL deny the action and prompt the user to register or log in.
WHEN an authenticated member in good standing submits posts or replies, THE system SHALL allow the action subject to content validation rules.

### 5.2 Banning and Restrictions
WHEN a user violates content rules repeatedly as determined by moderator review, THEN THE system SHALL allow administrators to impose temporary or permanent bans restricting the user's ability to post.
IF a user is banned, THEN THE system SHALL reject all post and reply submissions from the user until the ban is lifted.

## 6. Error Handling and Recovery

WHEN content submission fails due to length or profanity validation, THEN THE system SHALL return a detailed error message including reasons for rejection and guidance for correction.
WHEN a moderator action such as editing or deleting content fails due to system error, THEN THE system SHALL log the error and notify the moderator to retry the action.

## 7. Performance Expectations

WHEN validating user-submitted content for length and profanity, THE system SHALL complete validation and respond to the user within 2 seconds to maintain a responsive user experience.

## 9. Summary
This collection of business rules and validation logic specifically governs user content creation, moderation, and community compliance within the economic and political discussion board. The requirements ensure measurable, enforceable standards suitable for implementation by backend developers. Each rule includes clear error handling and performance expectations to foster a robust and user-friendly platform.
