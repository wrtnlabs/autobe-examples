# Error Handling and Recovery Processes for discussionBoard

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the business requirements for error handling and recovery processes from a user perspective within the discussionBoard service. The focus is on ensuring clear, consistent handling of typical error situations during authentication, content management, user session management, and related operations. These requirements aim to ensure a robust and user-friendly discussion board experience centered around economic and political topics.

## 2. Authentication Errors

### 2.1 Invalid Login Credentials
WHEN a user (member or moderator) submits invalid login credentials, THE discussionBoard system SHALL respond with an authentication failure message within 2 seconds explaining that credentials are invalid without revealing sensitive information.

### 2.2 Unverified Email Attempt
WHEN a user who has registered but not verified their email attempts to log in, THE system SHALL deny access and instruct the user to verify their email before login.

### 2.3 Account Locked Due to Failed Attempts
WHEN a user exceeds 5 consecutive failed login attempts, THE system SHALL lock the account for 15 minutes and notify the user of the temporary lockout with clear instructions on next steps.

### 2.4 Password Reset Failures
WHEN a user requests password reset with an unregistered or invalid email address, THE system SHALL respond with a generic message stating the reset request was processed without revealing whether the email exists.

## 3. Content Violation Handling

### 3.1 Profanity Filter Detection
WHEN a user submits a post or reply containing profane or banned words, THE system SHALL reject the submission and display an error message instructing the user to remove inappropriate content.

### 3.2 Post Length Limit Exceeded
WHEN a user submits a post or reply that exceeds the maximum allowed length (e.g., 1000 characters for posts, 500 characters for replies), THE system SHALL reject the submission and display an error message with the character limit.

### 3.3 Moderator Content Removal
WHEN a post or reply is flagged or reviewed by a moderator and deemed inappropriate, THE system SHALL allow moderators to delete or edit the content and notify the user of removal with a reason if applicable.

### 3.4 Handling Invalid Categories
WHEN a user tries to create a discussion topic in an unsupported category (anything other than "economic" or "political"), THE system SHALL reject the request and provide an error message listing valid categories.

## 4. Post and Reply Management Errors

### 4.1 Post Creation Failures
WHEN a member submits a new discussion topic and a system error occurs (e.g., database connectivity), THE system SHALL respond with a retry message and log the failure for administrative review.

### 4.2 Unauthorized Post Edit Attempts
WHEN a user attempts to edit or delete posts/replies they do not own and are not moderators or admins, THE system SHALL deny the action and return an authorization error message.

### 4.3 Concurrent Edit Conflicts
WHEN multiple moderators attempt to edit the same post or reply at the same time, THE system SHALL implement locking or conflict detection and notify the second user attempting to save with a conflict message.

### 4.4 Post Not Found
WHEN a user attempts to view, edit, or reply to a post or reply that has been deleted or does not exist, THE system SHALL return a not found error and a user-friendly message.

## 5. User Session Issues

### 5.1 Session Expiration
WHEN a user's session expires (inactivity beyond configured timeout), THE system SHALL require re-authentication before allowing posting or replying.

### 5.2 Concurrent Sessions
WHEN a user logs in from a new device or browser causing concurrent session detection, THE system SHALL allow concurrent sessions but notify the user of active logins on multiple devices.

### 5.3 Session Revocation
WHEN a user changes their password or logs out from all devices, THE system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions immediately.

### 5.4 Session Tampering Detected
WHEN session token tampering or invalidity is detected during any authenticated request, THE system SHALL terminate the session and prompt the user to log in again.

## 6. Summary

This document provides detailed business requirements for error handling in the discussionBoard service. It covers authentication failures, content violations, post and reply management errors, and user session issues with clear directives for user messaging and recovery procedures. The consistent application of these requirements will ensure a resilient and user-friendly environment for economic and political discourse.
