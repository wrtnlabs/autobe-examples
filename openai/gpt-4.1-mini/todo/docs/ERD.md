## Tasks

```mermaid

  DateTime created_at
  DateTime updated_at
  DateTime deleted_at "nullable"
}
```

### `todo_list_tasks`

Represents individual todo tasks created and managed by authenticated
users. Each task is linked to a user (todo_list_users) by foreign key
todo_list_user_id. Tasks have a description text, a boolean completion

task management requiring CRUD operations.
