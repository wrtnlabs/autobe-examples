   *
   * The update request allows authorized users, such as the refund request

   * request and ensuring data integrity.

   * This operation enables refund request management as part of the order
   * lifecycle, supporting workflows like approval, rejection, or processing
   * progress updates.

   * attempts are made.

   * Validation ensures that both orderId and refundRequestId are valid UUIDs
   * corresponding to existing records, rejecting invalid or unauthorized access
   * requests. Related order and customer information can be queried separately

   * This operation deletes a refund request record in the shopping mall

   * uniquely identify the refund request to delete. Upon execution, the refund
   * request linked to the specified order is permanently removed from the
   * database and cannot be recovered.

   * Authorization is required: typically, only customers linked to the order or
