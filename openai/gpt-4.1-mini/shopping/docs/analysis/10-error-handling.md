# Error Handling and Recovery Requirements for E-commerce Shopping Mall Platform

## 1. Introduction
This document specifies the business requirements for error handling, user notification, and recovery processes in the shopping mall e-commerce platform. It ensures that errors are managed in a way that maintains system reliability, guides users appropriately, and facilitates problem resolution.

## 2. Error Types and Responses

### 2.1 User Input Validation Errors
WHEN a user submits invalid or incomplete information (e.g., during registration, address entry, or checkout), THE shoppingMall SHALL reject the submission and return a specific error code and message describing the validation failure.

IF user input fails format or required field validation, THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL provide field-level error details to facilitate user correction.

### 2.2 Authentication and Authorization Errors
WHEN a user attempts to log in with invalid credentials, THE shoppingMall SHALL respond with an authentication failure error and limit retry attempts to 5 times within 15 minutes to mitigate brute force attacks.

WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access features restricted to authenticated roles, THE shoppingMall SHALL respond with an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error and prompt the user to log in.

WHEN a user tries to perform an action without appropriate permissions (e.g., a guest trying to manage products), THE shoppingMall SHALL respond with an HTTP 403 Forbidden error indicating insufficient permissions.

### 2.3 Business Logic Errors
WHEN a user attempts to add to cart a product SKU that is out of stock, THE shoppingMall SHALL reject the request and notify the user of the unavailability.

WHEN a user attempts to place an order but inventory levels are insufficient for one or more SKUs, THE shoppingMall SHALL decline the order with a clear message specifying affected products.

WHEN a user tries to submit a product review without having purchased the product, THE shoppingMall SHALL reject the submission and notify the user of review eligibility criteria.

### 2.4 System and Infrastructure Errors
WHEN the shoppingMall encounters internal errors such as database failures, network issues, or third-party service outages, THE shoppingMall SHALL return a generic error message to the user and log detailed error information.

IF the system detects repeated failures of a service or component, THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL trigger alerts to system administrators for investigation.

### 2.5 Payment and Order Processing Errors
WHEN a payment transaction fails (e.g., declined card, gateway error), THE shoppingMall SHALL notify the user with an error message explaining the reason if available and prompt for retry.

WHEN order confirmation fails after payment success due to system errors, THE shoppingMall SHALL initiate an automatic retry up to 3 times and notify the user of delay.

## 3. User Notification Mechanisms

### 3.1 Notification Types
THE shoppingMall SHALL support the following notification types:
- Real-time in-app notifications
- Email notifications
- SMS notifications (where phone number is provided and verified)

### 3.2 Notification Triggers
WHEN important events occur such as order placement, payment failure, shipping status updates, or refund approvals, THE shoppingMall SHALL trigger notifications to the affected users.

### 3.3 Notification Delivery Methods
THE shoppingMall SHALL attempt delivery of notifications via all enabled channels for the user, defaulting to in-app notification first.

IF a notification fails to deliver via one channel, THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL retry or fallback to alternative channels where configured.

### 3.4 User-facing Error Messages
WHEN errors occur, THE shoppingMall SHALL display concise, non-technical error messages that guide the user towards next steps.

IF an error is caused by user actions (e.g., invalid input), THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL provide specific feedback pinpointing the issue.

IF an error is caused by system failure, THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL display a generic apology message and recommend retrying later.

## 4. Retry and Recovery Processes

### 4.1 Automatic Retry Policies
WHEN transient errors occur during order confirmation or payment processing, THE shoppingMall SHALL implement automatic retry attempts up to 3 times with exponential backoff.

### 4.2 Manual Recovery Actions
WHEN automatic retries fail, THE shoppingMall SHALL notify system administrators and provide tools to manually intervene and resolve the issue.

### 4.3 Escalation Procedures
IF critical system failures persist beyond configured thresholds, THEN THE shoppingMall SHALL escalate alerts to higher-level support teams.

## 5. Logging and Monitoring

### 5.1 Logging Requirements
THE shoppingMall SHALL log all errors with timestamp, affected user ID, operation context, error codes, and detailed stack traces where applicable.

### 5.2 Monitoring & Alerting
THE shoppingMall SHALL monitor error rates and system health metrics continuously and generate alerts when error thresholds exceed predefined limits.

## 6. Summary
This document provides clear and actionable business requirements to ensure robust error handling, effective user notification, and comprehensive recovery mechanisms for the shopping mall platform. These requirements aim to deliver reliability and transparency, improving user trust and system maintainability.
