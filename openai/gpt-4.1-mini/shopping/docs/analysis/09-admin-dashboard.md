## 4. User Management Tools

- THE system SHALL permit administrators to search and filter users by role (customer, seller, admin), registration date, account status, and activity.
- THE system SHALL provide details for individual users, including profile information, order history, and activity logs.
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to suspend, reactivate, or delete user accounts.
- THE system SHALL provide mechanisms to reset passwords or resend account verification emails.
- THE system SHALL enable administrators to moderate and remove inappropriate reviews or ratings submitted by users.

## 5. Reporting and Analytics

- THE system SHALL provide dashboards for administrators to view key performance indicators such as total sales, number of orders, active users, and top-selling products.
- THE system SHALL allow generation of detailed reports based on selectable criteria like date ranges, product categories, and user segments.
- THE system SHALL offer visualization of data through charts, graphs, and tables to support business analysis and decision-making.

## 6. Security and Access Control

- THE system SHALL restrict access to the admin dashboard exclusively to users with the admin role authenticated through secure login and token validation.
- THE system SHALL implement role-based access control ensuring only authorized administrators can perform sensitive operations.
- THE system SHALL record audit logs of administrative actions on orders, products, and user accounts for accountability and troubleshooting.
- THE system SHALL enforce session management policies including automatic session expiration and multi-factor authentication support as per security guidelines.

## 7. Error Handling and Performance Expectations

- IF any data retrieval or update fails in the admin dashboard, THEN THE system SHALL display a clear error message indicating the failure reason and suggested next steps.
- THE system SHALL ensure all admin dashboard requests respond within 3 seconds under normal operating conditions even during peak loads.
