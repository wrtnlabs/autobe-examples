/**
 * This test validates the complete workflow of an administrator creating a new
 * order status record.
 *
 * Business Context: An order lifecycle status update is critical for tracking
 * shipping and payment statuses. Only authorized admin users should be able to
 * create these status entries.
 *
 * Step-by-step:
 *
 * 1. Register (join) an admin user and authenticate login.
 * 2. Register and authenticate a customer user.
 * 3. Register and authenticate a seller user.
 * 4. Create a customer order linked to the created customer and seller.
 * 5. Authenticate the admin user again to ensure correct session.
 * 6. Create a new order status record with a status like "Paid" and validate the
 *    successful creation.
 *
 * The test asserts all returned data with typia.assert() and confirms values
 * and process logic using TestValidator.
