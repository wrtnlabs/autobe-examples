/**
 * Test updating order status by seller with valid status transitions.
 *
 * This test ensures a seller can log in, a customer can log in and place an
 * order, and the seller can update the order status through legitimate
 * lifecycle statuses. It validates that the status is recorded correctly,
 * previous status persists, and invalid statuses cause errors.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Seller joins (authentication)
 * 2. Customer joins (authentication)
 * 3. Admin creates seller record
 * 4. Admin creates customer record
 * 5. Customer creates an order associated with seller
 * 6. Seller updates order status through the valid statuses
 * 7. Verification of updated statuses
 * 8. Attempt invalid status update and expect error
