# Business Rules and Constraints for Todo List Application

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document defines the comprehensive business rules, validation requirements, and operational constraints that govern the behavior of the Todo List Application. These rules ensure data integrity, maintain system reliability, and provide consistent user experience while supporting the minimal functionality requirements for personal task management.

### 1.1 Document Scope
This specification covers all business rules and constraints for the todo list application, focusing on input validation, business logic constraints, data integrity requirements, and operational rules. These requirements ensure the system behaves predictably and reliably while maintaining data consistency.

### 1.2 Business Context
The Todo List Application serves as a simple, single-user task management tool designed for personal productivity. The business rules defined herein ensure that users can reliably manage their todo items with confidence that their data will remain consistent and accessible.

## 2. Input Validation Rules

### 2.1 Todo Item Creation Validation

**WHEN** a user attempts to create a new todo item, **THE** system **SHALL** validate the following constraints:

**Text Content Validation:**
- **WHEN** creating a todo item, **THE** system **SHALL** require the todo text to be a non-empty string
- **WHEN** processing todo text input, **THE** system **SHALL** trim leading and trailing whitespace
- **WHEN** the trimmed todo text is empty, **THE** system **SHALL** reject the creation attempt
- **THE** todo text **SHALL** have a minimum length of 1 character
- **THE** todo text **SHALL** have a maximum length of 500 characters
- **WHEN** todo text exceeds 500 characters, **THE** system **SHALL** truncate it to 500 characters

**Character Validation:**
- **THE** todo text **SHALL** accept alphanumeric characters, spaces, punctuation, and common symbols
- **THE** system **SHALL** reject todo text containing only whitespace characters
- **THE** system **SHALL** sanitize input to prevent injection attacks

### 2.2 Status Validation Rules

**WHEN** updating todo item status, **THE** system **SHALL** enforce the following constraints:

**Status Value Constraints:**
- **THE** todo status **SHALL** only accept "pending" or "completed" as valid values
- **WHEN** an invalid status value is provided, **THE** system **SHALL** reject the update
- **THE** system **SHALL** default new todo items to "pending" status

**Status Transition Rules:**
- **WHEN** marking a todo as completed, **THE** system **SHALL** validate that the todo exists and is currently pending
- **WHEN** marking a todo as pending, **THE** system **SHALL** validate that the todo exists and is currently completed
- **THE** system **SHALL** prevent status transitions for non-existent todo items

### 2.3 User Input Sanitization Requirements

**Input Cleaning Rules:**
- **THE** system **SHALL** remove or escape HTML tags from todo text input

## 9. Implementation Guidelines

These business rules and constraints provide the foundation for building a reliable, consistent, and user-friendly todo list application. Developers should implement these rules to ensure the system behaves predictably and maintains data integrity under all operating conditions.

All validation rules should be implemented with user experience in mind, providing clear feedback when constraints are violated while maintaining the simplicity and ease of use that characterizes the minimal todo list application.
