# Todo List Application - Event Processing Requirements

## 1. Introduction to System Events

This document defines how the Todo list application processes various business events triggered by user interactions. The system operates as a single-user application where all events are initiated by the user's actions on their personal todo items.

### 1.1 Event Processing Philosophy
The system follows a straightforward event-driven architecture where:
- User actions trigger business events
- Each event follows a predictable processing sequence
- Data consistency is maintained through atomic operations
- Error handling ensures graceful failure recovery

### 1.2 Business Event Categories
The application processes four primary event categories:
- **Creation Events**: Adding new todo items to the system
- **Status Events**: Changing completion status of existing todos
- **Modification Events**: Updating todo text content
- **Deletion Events**: Removing todo items from the system

## 2. Core Business Event Definitions

### 2.1 Todo Creation Event
**Event Trigger**: WHEN a user creates a new todo item
**Event Payload**: Todo text content
**Processing Goal**: Add new todo to the user's list

**Event Flow**:
```mermaid
graph LR
  A["User Enters Todo Text"] --> B["Validate Input"]
  B --> C{"Valid Text?"}
  C -->|"Yes"| D["Generate Unique ID"]
  C -->|"No"| E["Show Validation Error"]
  D --> F["Create Todo Object"]
  F --> G["Save to Storage"]
  G --> H["Update UI Display"]
  G --> I["Return Success"]
```

**Business Requirements**:
- WHEN a user provides todo text, THE system SHALL validate the text is not empty
- WHEN todo text validation passes, THE system SHALL generate a unique identifier
- THE system SHALL create a todo object with default "incomplete" status
- THE system SHALL persist the new todo to storage
- THE system SHALL update the user interface to display the new todo
- THE system SHALL provide visual confirmation of successful creation

### 2.2 Todo Completion Event
**Event Trigger**: WHEN a user marks todo as completed
**Event Payload**: Todo ID, completion status
**Processing Goal**: Update todo completion status

**Event Flow**:
```mermaid
graph LR
  A["User Clicks Complete"] --> B["Find Todo by ID"]
  B --> C{"Todo Exists?"}
  C -->|"Yes"| D["Update Status"]
  C -->|"No"| E["Show Not Found Error"]
  D --> F["Save Updated Todo"]
  F --> G["Update UI Display"]
  F --> H["Return Success"]
```

**Business Requirements**:
- WHEN a user marks a todo as completed, THE system SHALL validate the todo exists
- THE system SHALL update the todo status to "completed"
- THE system SHALL record the completion timestamp
- THE system SHALL persist the status change to storage
- THE system SHALL update the visual appearance to reflect completion
- THE system SHALL provide immediate feedback confirming the status change

### 2.3 Todo Deletion Event
**Event Trigger**: WHEN a user deletes a todo item
**Event Payload**: Todo ID
**Processing Goal**: Remove todo from user's list

**Event Flow**:
```mermaid
graph LR
  A["User Requests Delete"] --> B["Find Todo by ID"]
  B --> C{"Todo Exists?"}
  C -->|"Yes"| D["Remove from Storage"]
  C -->|"No"| E["Show Not Found Error"]
  D --> F["Update UI Display"]
  D --> G["Return Success"]
```

**Business Requirements**:
- WHEN a user requests todo deletion, THE system SHALL validate the todo exists
- THE system SHALL display a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
- WHEN the user confirms deletion, THE system SHALL remove the todo from storage
- THE system SHALL update the user interface to reflect the removal
- THE system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming successful deletion
- THE system SHALL recalculate todo list statistics after deletion

### 2.4 Todo List Retrieval Event
**Event Trigger**: WHEN application loads or refreshes
**Event Payload**: None (user context)
**Processing Goal**: Retrieve all user's todos

**Event Flow**:
```mermaid
graph LR
  A["Application Loads"] --> B["Load All Todos"]
  B --> C{"Data Found?"}
  C -->|"Yes"| D["Sort by Creation Time"]
  C -->|"No"| E["Return Empty List"]
  D --> F["Display Todos"]
  D --> G["Return Success"]
```

**Business Requirements**:
- WHEN the application starts, THE system SHALL attempt to load saved todos
- THE system SHALL validate the integrity of loaded data
- WHEN data loading succeeds, THE system SHALL sort todos by creation time
- THE system SHALL display todos in the sorted order
- WHEN no data exists, THE system SHALL initialize with an empty list
- THE system SHALL handle data corruption gracefully with user notification

## 3. Event Handling Procedures

### 3.1 Input Validation Sequence
WHEN processing any user input, THE system SHALL validate the data according to the following rules:

**Validation Requirements**:
- THE todo text SHALL be between 1 and 500 characters in length
- THE todo text SHALL not contain only whitespace characters
- THE todo ID SHALL be a valid identifier when provided
- THE completion status SHALL be a boolean value

**Validation Flow**:
```mermaid
graph LR
  A["Receive User Input"] --> B["Check Text Length"]
  B --> C{"Valid Length?"}
  C -->|"No"| D["Reject: Too Long/Short"]
  C -->|"Yes"| E["Check Content"]
  E --> F{"Has Content?"}
  F -->|"No"| G["Reject: Empty Content"]
  F -->|"Yes"| H["Validate ID Format"]
  H --> I{"Valid ID?"}
  I -->|"No"| J["Reject: Invalid ID"]
  I -->|"Yes"| K["Accept Input"]
```

### 3.2 Data Storage Procedures
WHEN saving or updating todo data, THE system SHALL follow these storage procedures:

**Storage Requirements**:
- THE system SHALL maintain data persistence across application sessions
- THE system SHALL ensure data integrity during save operations
- THE system SHALL provide immediate feedback on save success or failure
- THE system SHALL handle storage errors gracefully without data loss

### 3.3 UI Update Procedures
WHEN completing any event processing, THE system SHALL update the user interface:

**UI Update Requirements**:
- THE system SHALL reflect changes immediately in the display
- THE system SHALL provide visual feedback for completed actions
- THE system SHALL maintain consistent state between storage and display
- THE system SHALL handle UI update failures without disrupting user workflow

## 4. Data Flow Management
