# User Roles and Authentication Requirements

## Introduction

This document defines the complete user roles, authentication system, and authorization requirements for the Todo list application. The authentication system is designed to provide secure access control while maintaining simplicity for a single-user focused application.

## User Role Definitions

### User Role
THE user SHALL be the primary role responsible for managing personal todo items. This role represents individual users who interact with the application to organize their tasks.

**Capabilities:**
- Create new todo items
- View all personal todo items
- Mark todo items as completed or incomplete
- Delete personal todo items
- Edit existing personal todo items
- Filter todo items by completion status

**Limitations:**
- Cannot access other users' todo items
- Cannot modify system settings
- Cannot perform administrative functions

### Admin Role
THE admin SHALL be the system administrator role with comprehensive access to all application functions and settings.

**Capabilities:**
- All capabilities available to user role
- Access system-wide settings and configurations
- View application usage statistics
- Perform system maintenance operations
- Reset user data when necessary
- Configure application preferences

## Authentication Flow Requirements

### User Registration
WHEN a new user accesses the application for the first time, THE system SHALL automatically create a user account with default settings.

### Login Process
WHEN a user opens the application, THE system SHALL automatically authenticate the user without requiring manual login credentials.

### Session Management
WHILE a user is actively using the application, THE system SHALL maintain an authenticated session.

### Automatic Authentication
THE system SHALL automatically authenticate users upon application startup using stored session tokens.

## Permission Matrix

| Action | User | Admin |
|--------|------|-------|
| Create todo item | ✅ | ✅ |
| Read own todo items | ✅ | ✅ |
| Read all todo items | ❌ | ✅ |
| Update own todo items | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update all todo items | ❌ | ✅ |
| Delete own todo items | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete all todo items | ❌ | ✅ |
| Mark todo as complete | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mark todo as incomplete | ✅ | ✅ |
| Filter todos by status | ✅ | ✅ |
| Access system settings | ❌ | ✅ |
| View usage statistics | ❌ | ✅ |
| Perform system maintenance | ❌ | ✅ |

## Token Management Strategy

### JWT Token Structure
THE system SHALL use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication with the following payload structure:

```json
{
  "userId": "unique-user-identifier",
  "role": "user",
  "permissions": ["create_todo", "read_todo", "update_todo", "delete_todo"],
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

### Token Expiration
THE access token SHALL expire after 24 hours of inactivity.
THE refresh token SHALL expire after 30 days of inactivity.

### Token Storage
THE system SHALL store JWT tokens securely in localStorage for persistence across browser sessions.

### Token Refresh
WHEN an access token expires, THE system SHALL automatically refresh the token using the stored refresh token.

## Session Management Requirements

### Session Creation
WHEN a user successfully authenticates, THE system SHALL create a new session with a unique session identifier.

### Session Persistence
THE system SHALL persist user sessions across browser restarts and application reloads.

### Session Timeout
WHILE a user is inactive for more than 30 minutes, THE system SHALL maintain the session but may require re-authentication for sensitive operations.

### Session Termination
WHEN a user explicitly logs out, THE system SHALL terminate the current session and clear all authentication tokens.

## Security Requirements

### Data Isolation
THE system SHALL ensure that users can only access and modify their own todo items.

### Input Validation
WHEN processing authentication requests, THE system SHALL validate all input parameters to prevent injection attacks.

### Token Security
THE system SHALL implement proper JWT signature verification to prevent token tampering.

### Secure Storage
THE system SHALL store authentication tokens securely to prevent unauthorized access.

## Error Handling Scenarios

### Authentication Failures
IF the authentication token is invalid or expired, THEN THE system SHALL redirect the user to the login screen.

### Permission Denied
IF a user attempts to perform an action without sufficient permissions, THEN THE system SHALL return an appropriate error message.

### Session Expiration
IF a user session expires during an active operation, THEN THE system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate.

### Token Refresh Failure
IF token refresh fails due to network issues, THEN THE system SHALL allow the user to manually re-authenticate.

## Performance Requirements

### Authentication Response Time
THE system SHALL authenticate users within 500 milliseconds.

### Token Validation
THE system SHALL validate JWT tokens within 100 milliseconds.

### Session Restoration
THE system SHALL restore user sessions within 1 second of application startup.

## Business Rules

### User Data Ownership
Each user SHALL have exclusive ownership of their todo items.

### Role-Based Access Control
Access to application functions SHALL be determined by the user's assigned role.

### Automatic Session Management
THE system SHALL automatically manage user sessions without requiring manual intervention for routine operations.

## Implementation Considerations

### Single-User Focus
The authentication system is designed for a single-user application with minimal complexity.

### Persistent Storage
User authentication state SHALL be preserved across application restarts.

### Minimal User Interaction
The authentication process SHALL require minimal user interaction for routine usage.

This authentication system provides a secure foundation for the Todo list application while maintaining the simplicity required for a single-user focused application. The role-based access control ensures that users can only perform authorized actions on their own data, while administrators have the necessary access for system maintenance and oversight.
