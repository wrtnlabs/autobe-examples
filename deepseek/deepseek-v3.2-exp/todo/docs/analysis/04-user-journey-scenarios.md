# User Journey Scenarios for Todo List Application

## Introduction

This document defines the complete user journey scenarios for the Todo List application, focusing on minimum functionality requirements. These scenarios provide backend developers with comprehensive understanding of user workflows, business processes, and system interactions required to implement the core todo management features.

### Document Scope and Purpose
This document covers all user interaction workflows for the single-user Todo List application, including authentication flows, todo management operations, error handling scenarios, and performance expectations. The scenarios ensure that developers understand the complete user experience from initial access through daily usage patterns.

### Business Context
The Todo List application serves individual users who need simple, reliable task management without complex features or authentication barriers. The user journeys focus on immediate usability, data persistence, and intuitive operation for personal productivity.

## User Registration and Setup Flow

### First-Time User Experience Journey

**Scenario**: User accesses the Todo application for the first time

1. **Initial Access**: WHEN a user opens the Todo application for the first time, THE system SHALL display a clean, intuitive interface with clear todo creation elements and an empty state message.

2. **Automatic User Setup**: THE system SHALL automatically create a single-user session without requiring authentication credentials or registration forms.

3. **Session Initialization**: THE system SHALL initialize a persistent user session that survives browser restarts and application reloads.

4. **Data Storage Setup**: THE system SHALL initialize local data storage and verify persistence capabilities are available.

5. **Welcome Experience**: THE system SHALL provide clear visual cues and minimal onboarding instructions for first-time users.

### Returning User Experience Journey

**Scenario**: User returns to the application after previous usage

1. **Session Restoration**: WHEN a user returns to the application, THE system SHALL automatically restore their previous session state.

2. **Data Loading**: THE system SHALL load all previously saved todo items with their exact completion status and creation order.

3. **Interface Restoration**: THE system SHALL display the todo list exactly as it appeared during the last session.

4. **State Recovery**: THE system SHALL recover any pending operations or unsaved changes from the previous session.

```

## Todo Creation Process

### Complete Todo Creation Journey

**Scenario**: User creates a new todo item

1. **Initiation**: WHEN a user clicks the "Add Todo" button or enters text in the new todo input field, THE system SHALL display the input field with clear visual focus.

2. **Input Validation**: WHILE the user is entering todo text, THE system SHALL validate input in real-time and provide immediate feedback.

3. **Character Limit Monitoring**: THE system SHALL display remaining character count and enforce the 500-character maximum limit.

4. **Todo Submission**: WHEN the user submits the new todo (via Enter key or Add button), THE system SHALL:
   - Validate the todo text contains at least 1 non-whitespace character
   - Validate the todo text does not exceed 500 characters
   - Create a new todo item with unique identifier
   - Set default "incomplete" status
   - Record creation timestamp
   - Add the todo to the current list in creation order
   - Persist the updated todo list to storage
   - Clear the input field for the next todo
   - Update the display to show the new todo
   - Provide visual success feedback

5. **Order Preservation**: THE system SHALL maintain the creation order of todos and display them chronologically.

### Todo Creation Error Handling

**Scenario**: User attempts to create invalid todo

1. **Empty Todo Validation**: IF the user attempts to submit an empty todo or todo containing only whitespace, THEN THE system SHALL display the error message: "Todo text cannot be empty. Please enter a task description."

2. **Maximum Length Validation**: IF the user attempts to submit a todo exceeding 500 characters, THEN THE system SHALL display the error message: "Todo text cannot exceed 500 characters. Current length: X/500."

3. **Input Preservation**: WHEN validation fails, THE system SHALL preserve the user's input to allow correction rather than forcing re-entry.

4. **Error Recovery**: THE system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to fix the validation error and allow immediate retry.

## Todo Management Workflows

### Viewing Todo List Journey

**Scenario**: User views their todo list

1. **List Display**: WHEN the application loads or the user navigates to the main screen, THE system SHALL display all existing todos in a clear, readable list with visual distinction between completed and incomplete items.

2. **Status Visualization**: THE system SHALL use clear visual indicators (checkboxes, strikethrough text, color coding) to distinguish completed and incomplete todos.

3. **Empty State Handling**: WHERE no todos exist, THE system SHALL display an encouraging empty state message with clear guidance for creating the first todo.

4. **Order Presentation**: THE system SHALL display todos in creation order by default, with newest items appearing at the bottom of the list.

5. **Statistics Display**: THE system SHALL show real-time statistics including total count, completed count, and completion percentage.

### Todo Status Management Journey

**Scenario**: User marks a todo as complete or incomplete

1. **Status Toggle Initiation**: WHEN a user clicks on a todo's completion status indicator (checkbox), THE system SHALL:
   - Identify the target todo item
   - Verify the todo exists in the current list
   - Toggle the completion status between "incomplete" and "completed"
   - Update the completion timestamp for completed items
   - Remove completion timestamp for incomplete items

2. **Immediate Feedback**: THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback showing the status change, including:
   - Checkbox state update
   - Text styling change (strikethrough for completed)
   - Color transition animation
   - Status confirmation message

3. **Persistence**: THE system SHALL immediately persist the status change to storage and confirm successful save.

4. **Statistics Update**: THE system SHALL recalculate and update completion statistics in real-time.

5. **Error Handling**: IF the status toggle fails, THE system SHALL revert the visual change and display an appropriate error message.

### Todo Deletion Journey

**Scenario**: User deletes a todo item

1. **Deletion Initiation**: WHEN a user clicks the delete button associated with a todo, THE system SHALL:
   - Highlight the todo item being considered for deletion
   - Display a confirmation dialog with the todo text
   - Provide clear "Confirm Delete" and "Cancel" options
   - Ensure the confirmation prevents accidental deletion

2. **Confirmation Processing**: IF the user confirms deletion, THEN THE system SHALL:
   - Remove the todo from the current list
   - Update list statistics
   - Persist the updated list to storage
   - Remove the todo from the display
   - Provide visual feedback confirming deletion
   - Show updated todo count

3. **Cancellation Handling**: IF the user cancels deletion, THEN THE system SHALL:
   - Close the confirmation dialog
   - Remove highlighting from the todo
   - Continue normal operation without changes

4. **Bulk Deletion Consideration**: WHERE multiple deletion operations occur rapidly, THE system SHALL process them sequentially to maintain data integrity.
