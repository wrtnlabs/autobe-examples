# Todo List Application - Functional Requirements

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Business Purpose
The Todo List Application provides a minimal, single-user task management system designed for personal productivity. The application addresses the fundamental need for simple, distraction-free task organization without the complexity of feature-rich productivity tools. By focusing exclusively on core CRUD operations and eliminating authentication barriers, the system delivers immediate value through streamlined task management.

### 1.2 Application Vision
This application serves users who seek immediate access to basic todo functionality without account creation, learning curves, or feature overload. The vision centers on providing reliable, persistent task management that requires zero setup time and minimal cognitive overhead for daily use.

### 1.3 Scope Definition
The application scope is deliberately constrained to four essential operations:
- **Create**: Add new todo items to the list
- **Read**: View all existing todo items
- **Update**: Mark items as completed/incomplete
- **Delete**: Remove items from the list

**Excluded by Design**: User authentication, task categorization, due dates, prioritization, collaboration features, advanced filtering, and notification systems.

### 1.4 Success Criteria
- Users can perform all core operations within 30 seconds of first use
- 99.9% uptime for core functionality
- Sub-second response time for all CRUD operations
- Consistent daily usage patterns indicating user adoption
- Zero data loss incidents in normal operation
