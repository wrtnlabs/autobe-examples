# Primary User Scenarios - Economic/Political Discussion Board

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the primary user scenarios and success paths for the economic/political discussion board platform. These scenarios represent the most common and critical user interactions that form the core user experience of the discussion platform. Each scenario is documented using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format to provide clear, unambiguous requirements for backend development.

## 2. User Registration and Authentication Flow

### 2.1 User Registration Scenario

**Scenario Goal**: Enable new users to create accounts and join the discussion community.

**Primary Flow**:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A["User Accesses Registration Page"] --> B["User Enters Registration Information"]
  B --> C["System Validates Input Data"]
  C --> D{"Validation Successful?"}
  D -->|"Yes"| E["Create User Account"]
  E --> F["Send Email Verification"]
  F --> G["Show Success Message"]
  D -->|"No"| H["Show Validation Errors"]
  H --> B
```

**Business Requirements**:

- WHEN a user provides valid registration information (email, username, password), THE system SHALL create a new user account with "member" role.
- WHEN a user account is created, THE system SHALL send an email verification link to the provided email address.
- WHERE email verification is required, THE system SHALL restrict posting privileges until email verification is completed.
- IF email verification fails (invalid link, expired), THE system SHALL allow the user to request a new verification email.
- THE system SHALL validate that email addresses are unique across all user accounts.
- THE system SHALL validate that usernames are unique and meet format requirements (3-30 characters, alphanumeric only).
- THE system SHALL enforce password complexity requirements (minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number).

**User Journey**:
1. User navigates to registration page
2. User enters email, username, and password
3. System validates inputs and checks for duplicates
4. System creates user account with "pending verification" status
5. System sends verification email with secure link
6. User clicks verification link in email
7. System activates account and grants "member" role permissions
8. System redirects user to dashboard with success message

### 2.2 User Login Scenario

**Scenario Goal**: Allow registered users to authenticate and access the discussion platform.

**Primary Flow**:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A["User Accesses Login Page"] --> B["User Enters Credentials"]
  B --> C["System Validates Credentials"]
  C --> D{"Credentials Valid?"}
  D -->|"Yes"| E["Create User Session"]
  E --> F["Generate JWT Token"]
  F --> G["Redirect to Dashboard"]
  D -->|"No"| H["Show Authentication Error"]
  H --> B
```

**Business Requirements**:

- WHEN a user provides valid credentials (username/email and password), THE system SHALL create an authenticated session.
- WHEN authentication succeeds, THE system SHALL generate a JWT token containing user ID, role, and permissions.
- THE system SHALL maintain user sessions for 30 days unless explicitly logged out.
- IF authentication fails due to invalid credentials, THE system SHALL return an appropriate error message without revealing whether username or password was incorrect.
- IF a user account is suspended or banned, THE system SHALL deny login access and display the appropriate message.
- WHERE "Remember Me" is selected, THE system SHALL extend session duration to 30 days.

**User Journey**:
1. User navigates to login page
2. User enters username/email and password
3. System validates credentials against stored hash
4. System generates JWT token with user information
5. System creates session and sets authentication cookie
6. User is redirected to personalized dashboard
7. System logs the login event for security monitoring

### 2.3 Password Recovery Scenario

**Scenario Goal**: Enable users to regain access to their accounts when passwords are forgotten.

**Business Requirements**:

- WHEN a user requests password reset, THE system SHALL send a password reset link to the registered email.
- THE password reset link SHALL expire after 24 hours for security.
