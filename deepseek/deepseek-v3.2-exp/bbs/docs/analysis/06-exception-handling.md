# Exception Handling and Error Recovery for Economic/Political Discussion Board

## 1. Introduction and Error Management Philosophy

This document defines the comprehensive error handling and recovery strategy for the economic/political discussion board platform. Given the sensitive nature of economic and political discourse, the platform must maintain user trust through transparent, helpful error handling that guides users toward resolution while preserving their work and maintaining system integrity.

### 1.1 Error Management Principles
- **WHEN** system errors occur, **THE system SHALL** prioritize user experience by preserving user data and providing clear recovery paths
- **WHERE** user input causes errors, **THE system SHALL** provide specific, actionable guidance to resolve the issue
- **IF** system failures prevent normal operation, **THEN THE system SHALL** implement graceful degradation to maintain core functionality

### 1.2 Error Severity Classification
- **Critical Errors**: System unavailable, data corruption, security breaches
- **High Severity Errors**: Major features unavailable, authentication failures
- **Medium Severity Errors**: Partial functionality loss, performance degradation
- **Low Severity Errors**: Minor inconveniences, cosmetic issues

## 2. Authentication and Session Management Errors

### 2.1 User Authentication Failures

**WHEN** a user provides invalid login credentials, **THE system SHALL** display: "The email or password you entered is incorrect. Please check your credentials and try again. If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it using the 'Forgot Password' link."

**IF** a user account is temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts, **THEN THE system SHALL** display: "Your account has been temporarily locked for security reasons after 5 unsuccessful login attempts. Please wait 15 minutes and try again, or use the 'Forgot Password' option to reset your password immediately."

**WHEN** JWT token validation fails during session continuation, **THE system SHALL** automatically attempt token refresh and display: "Your session has expired. We're attempting to renew your session automatically. If this continues, please log in again."

**IF** multi-factor authentication fails after 3 attempts, **THEN THE system SHALL** lock the account for 30 minutes and notify the user via email: "Multiple failed MFA attempts detected. Your account has been temporarily locked for security. You'll be able to try again in 30 minutes."

### 2.2 Session Management Recovery

**WHILE** a user's session expires during content creation, **THE system SHALL** automatically save their draft and redirect to login with: "Your session expired while you were working. We've saved your draft. Please log in again to continue where you left off."

**WHEN** concurrent session limits are exceeded, **THE system SHALL** terminate the oldest session and notify: "You've reached the maximum of 5 concurrent sessions. Your oldest session has been terminated to allow this login."

**IF** suspicious session activity is detected, **THEN THE system SHALL** require re-authentication and send security notification: "Unusual activity detected from your account. For security, we've logged you out. Please log in again and verify your identity."

### 2.3 Registration and Account Management Errors

**WHEN** email verification fails due to expired links, **THE system SHALL** provide: "This verification link has expired. We've sent a new verification email to your address. Please check your inbox and click the new link within 24 hours."

**IF** username validation fails during registration, **THEN THE system SHALL** display: "Username must be 3-30 characters containing only letters, numbers, and underscores. Please choose a different username."

**WHEN** password strength requirements are not met, **THE system SHALL** provide specific feedback: "Password must be at least 8 characters and include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Your password is missing: [specific requirements not met]."

## 3. Content Creation and Management Errors

### 3.1 Discussion Topic Validation Failures

**WHEN** a user attempts to create a topic with an empty title, **THE system SHALL** display: "Topic title cannot be empty. Please provide a descriptive title between 10-200 characters that clearly summarizes your discussion point."

**IF** topic content exceeds 5000 characters, **THEN THE system SHALL** show: "Topic content exceeds the 5000 character limit. Your current content is [character count] characters. Please shorten your content or consider breaking it into multiple posts."

**WHEN** duplicate topic detection triggers, **THE system SHALL** suggest: "A similar discussion already exists: '[similar topic title]'. Would you like to contribute to the existing discussion instead of creating a new one?"

**IF** content contains prohibited terms, **THEN THE system SHALL** provide: "Your content contains language that violates our community guidelines. Please review our content policy and revise your submission. The flagged terms are: [specific terms]."

### 3.2 Comment and Reply System Errors

**WHEN** comment nesting exceeds 5 levels, **THE system SHALL** display: "Reply nesting limit reached. Please start a new discussion thread or reply to a higher-level comment to continue the conversation."

**IF** comment posting rate limits are exceeded, **THEN THE system SHALL** enforce: "You've reached the posting limit of 20 comments per hour. Please wait [time remaining] before posting again to ensure quality discussions."

**WHEN** users attempt to edit comments beyond the 1-hour window, **THE system SHALL** explain: "The 1-hour editing window for this comment has expired. If you need to make significant changes, consider posting a follow-up comment with your corrections or clarifications."

### 3.3 File Upload and Media Handling Errors

**IF** uploaded files exceed 10MB size limits, **THEN THE system SHALL** reject with: "File size exceeds the 10MB limit. Your file is [current size]. Please compress your file or choose a smaller version."

**WHEN** unsupported file types are uploaded, **THE system SHALL** specify: "File type not supported. Please upload images (JPG, PNG, GIF) or documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX) under 10MB. Your file type [file type] is not currently supported."

**IF** image processing fails during upload, **THEN THE system SHALL** attempt recovery: "We couldn't process your image. The file may be corrupted or in an unsupported format. Please try uploading a different file or contact support if the problem persists."

## 4. Permission and Authorization Errors

### 4.1 Role-Based Access Control Failures

**WHEN** guests attempt content creation, **THE system SHALL** redirect with: "Please register or log in to create discussion topics and comments. Creating an account takes less than 2 minutes and unlocks full participation."

**IF** members attempt moderator functions, **THEN THE system SHALL** display: "This feature is available to moderators only. If you're interested in helping moderate discussions, please contact the administrator team."

**WHEN** users attempt to modify others' content, **THE system SHALL** enforce: "You can only edit or delete content that you created. This [post/comment] was created by [username] on [date]."

### 4.2 Content Moderation Restriction Errors

**IF** moderators attempt to approve their own content, **THEN THE system SHALL** prevent: "Moderators cannot approve their own content. Please ask another moderator to review your submission to maintain impartiality."

**WHEN** users repeatedly report the same content, **THE system SHALL** inform: "You have already reported this content. Our moderation team will review it shortly. Duplicate reports don't expedite the process."

## 5. System Performance and Scalability Errors

### 5.1 High Load Degradation Scenarios

**WHILE** the system experiences high traffic during peak political events, **THE system SHALL** implement graceful degradation: "We're experiencing unusually high traffic. Some features may respond slower than usual. We're working to maintain service quality during this busy period."

**IF** database connection limits are reached, **THEN THE system SHALL** queue requests: "System is processing high volume. Your request is queued and will be processed shortly. Please don't refresh the page."

**WHEN** search functionality becomes overloaded, **THE system SHALL** provide alternatives: "Search is temporarily slowed due to high demand. You can browse categories directly or try your search again in a few moments."

### 5.2 Resource Exhaustion Recovery

**IF** memory limits are approached, **THEN THE system SHALL** prioritize critical functions: "System resources are strained. Non-essential features are temporarily limited to ensure core discussion functionality remains available."

**WHEN** cache systems fail, **THE system SHALL** maintain basic functionality: "Performance may be temporarily reduced while we restore system optimization. All features remain available but may respond slower than usual."

## 6. Third-Party Service Integration Errors

### 6.1 External API Failures

**WHEN** authentication service becomes unavailable, **THE system SHALL** maintain read-only access: "Authentication service is temporarily unavailable. You can continue browsing discussions, but posting requires login. Service should be restored within [estimated time]."

**IF** payment processing fails during subscription, **THEN THE system SHALL** retry with user guidance: "We're having trouble processing your payment. Please check your payment information and try again. If problems continue, contact our support team."

**WHEN** email delivery services experience outages, **THE system SHALL** queue notifications: "Email delivery is temporarily delayed. Your notifications are queued and will be sent as soon as service is restored. No action is needed from you."

### 6.2 Content Moderation Service Errors

**IF** automated content filtering service fails, **THEN THE system SHALL** default to manual review: "Content review is taking longer than usual. All posts are undergoing manual moderation to ensure community guidelines are maintained."

**WHEN** spam detection services are unavailable, **THE system SHALL** increase manual monitoring: "Spam protection is temporarily reduced. Our moderation team is actively monitoring for inappropriate content. Please report any suspicious activity."

## 7. Data Integrity and Recovery Scenarios

### 7.1 Data Corruption Recovery

**WHEN** data inconsistency is detected, **THE system SHALL** attempt automatic repair: "We've detected a data inconsistency and are automatically repairing it. This should only take a moment. Your data remains safe during this process."

**IF** automatic recovery fails, **THEN THE system SHALL** guide manual resolution: "We need your help to resolve a data issue. Please [specific action] to restore your content. Our support team is available if you need assistance."

### 7.2 Backup Restoration Procedures

**WHEN** data restoration from backup is required, **THE system SHALL** communicate clearly: "We're restoring from backup to ensure data integrity. Recent changes may be temporarily unavailable. Normal service will resume within [time estimate]."
