# Economic/Political Discussion Board - Project Documentation Overview

## Project Vision

This project aims to create a modern, user-friendly discussion platform specifically designed for economic and political discourse. The platform will facilitate thoughtful conversations, enable knowledge sharing, and provide a structured environment for users to engage in meaningful discussions about important societal topics.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation set provides comprehensive guidance for backend developers to implement a robust discussion board platform. The documents are organized to progressively build understanding from business requirements to technical implementation details.

### Core Documentation

1. **[Service Overview](./01-service-overview.md)** - Defines the business foundation, market opportunity, and strategic vision for the economic/political discussion platform.

2. **[User Roles and Authentication](./02-user-roles.md)** - Identifies and describes all user personas and their roles within the discussion board ecosystem.

3. **[Service Operation Workflow](./03-service-operation.md)** - Documents the complete operational workflow of the discussion board from user perspective.

4. **[Primary User Scenarios](./04-primary-scenarios.md)** - Defines the primary user scenarios and success paths for the discussion platform.

5. **[Secondary User Flows](./05-secondary-scenarios.md)** - Documents secondary user flows, edge cases, and alternative interaction patterns.

6. **[Exception Handling](./06-exception-handling.md)** - Defines error handling, exception scenarios, and system recovery processes from user perspective.

7. **[Performance Requirements](./07-performance-requirements.md)** - Specifies performance expectations, response time requirements, and user experience standards.

8. **[Security and Compliance](./08-security-compliance.md)** - Defines security requirements, data protection standards, and compliance considerations.

9. **[External Integrations](./09-external-integrations.md)** - Documents external service integrations, payment systems, and third-party dependencies.

10. **[Business Rules](./10-business-rules.md)** - Defines business rules, validation constraints, and operational limitations.

- Review, approve, or remove content
- Manage user reports
- Maintain discussion quality
- Enforce community guidelines

### Administrator Users
System administrators with full access to:
- Manage users and permissions
- Create and manage categories
- Configure system settings

## Document Purpose and Audience

### Primary Audience
- **Backend Developers**: Engineers responsible for implementing the core platform functionality
- **System Architects**: Technical leads designing the system architecture
- **DevOps Engineers**: Team members handling deployment and infrastructure

### Secondary Audience
- **Product Managers**: Stakeholders defining product requirements and roadmap
- **Business Analysts**: Professionals translating business needs to technical requirements
- **QA Engineers**: Testers validating system functionality against requirements

### Documentation Goals
- Provide clear, unambiguous business requirements
- Enable efficient development with minimal clarification needed
- Establish consistent terminology and system behavior expectations
- Support parallel development across multiple teams
- Serve as authoritative reference throughout development lifecycle

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Backend Developers
1. Start with the [Service Overview](./01-service-overview.md) to understand business context
2. Review [User Roles](./02-user-roles.md) to understand authentication and authorization requirements
3. Study [Service Operation](./03-service-operation.md) for core workflow understanding
4. Implement features based on [Primary Scenarios](./04-primary-scenarios.md) and [Secondary Scenarios](./05-secondary-scenarios.md)
5. Reference [Business Rules](./10-business-rules.md) for validation logic and constraints
6. Consult [Performance Requirements](./07-performance-requirements.md) and [Security Compliance](./08-security-compliance.md) for non-functional requirements

### For Project Managers
1. Use [Service Overview](./01-service-overview.md) for stakeholder communication
2. Reference [User Roles](./02-user-roles.md) for permission planning
3. Review [Primary Scenarios](./04-primary-scenarios.md) for user experience planning

### Development Approach
- All requirements are written in natural language focusing on business logic
- Technical implementation decisions are left to development team discretion
- EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format used for clarity
- Mermaid diagrams provided for complex workflows
- Cross-references maintained between related documents

### Document Navigation Tips
- Use descriptive link text (not raw filenames) for better readability
- Follow logical progression from business to technical requirements
- Reference related documents when implementing interconnected features
- Check [Exception Handling](./06-exception-handling.md) for error scenario guidance
- Consult [External Integrations](./09-external-integrations.md) for third-party service requirements

> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**. All technical implementations (architecture, APIs, database design, etc.) are at the discretion of the development team.*
