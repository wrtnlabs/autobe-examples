## Integration Points with Other System Components

This document complements the primary scenarios described in [Primary Scenarios Documentation](./04-primary-scenarios.md) and builds upon the user role definitions in [User Roles Documentation](./02-user-roles.md). The business rules governing these scenarios are detailed in the [Business Rules Documentation](./10-business-rules.md).

## Success Criteria

Successful implementation of these secondary scenarios will be measured by:
- Users can efficiently manage their profiles and preferences
- Content editing and deletion workflows are intuitive and reliable
- Category navigation and search functionality provides accurate results
- Bulk operations perform efficiently even with large datasets
- System maintains data integrity during all secondary operations
- Error recovery mechanisms provide graceful degradation
