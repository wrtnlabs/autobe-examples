# User Roles and Authentication System Requirements

## Introduction

This document defines the comprehensive user role structure and authentication system for the shopping mall e-commerce platform. The platform operates as a multi-vendor marketplace where different user types interact with distinct capabilities and permissions. The authentication system must securely manage user identities while providing appropriate access controls based on user roles.

## Authentication System Requirements

### User Registration Process

**WHEN** a user registers for a new account, **THE** system **SHALL** collect the following mandatory information:
- Email address (must be unique and validated)
- Password (minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character)
- First name and last name
- Phone number for order notifications

**WHERE** email verification is required, **THE** system **SHALL** send a verification link to the provided email address that expires within 24 hours.

**IF** email verification is not completed within 24 hours, **THEN** **THE** system **SHALL** automatically delete the pending registration and require restarting the process.

**WHEN** a user attempts to register with an existing email, **THE** system **SHALL** display error message: "This email address is already registered. Please use a different email or reset your password."

### User Login Process

**WHEN** a user attempts to login, **THE** system **SHALL** validate credentials against stored user data using secure password hashing algorithms.

**IF** login attempts exceed 5 failures within 15 minutes, **THEN** **THE** system **SHALL** temporarily lock the account for 30 minutes and notify the user via email.

**THE** system **SHALL** generate JWT tokens for authenticated sessions with the following specifications:
- Access token expiration: 15 minutes
- Refresh token expiration: 7 days
- Token payload includes userId, role, permissions array, and session metadata
- Token validation against cryptographic signature for all authenticated requests

### Password Management Requirements

**WHEN** a user requests password reset, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Send reset instructions to the verified email address
- Generate a time-limited reset token valid for 1 hour
- Require password confirmation during reset process
- Invalidate all active sessions after password change
- Prevent reuse of recent passwords (last 5 passwords)

**THE** system **SHALL** enforce password complexity requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters length
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
- No common passwords or dictionary words

### Multi-Factor Authentication

**WHEN** users enable multi-factor authentication, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Require MFA for sensitive operations (password changes, payment updates)
- Support time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) via authenticator apps
- Provide backup codes for account recovery
- Allow trusted device registration for 30 days

**WHERE** high-risk activities are detected, **THE** system **SHALL** require additional authentication verification.

## User Role Hierarchy

### Role Definitions and Relationships

The platform supports four distinct user roles with hierarchical relationships:
