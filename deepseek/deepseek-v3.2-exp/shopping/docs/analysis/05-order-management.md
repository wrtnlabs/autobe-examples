# Order Management System Specification

## Introduction and Business Context

### Order Management System Overview
The Order Management System serves as the central nervous system of the shopping mall platform, orchestrating the complete lifecycle of customer orders from placement through delivery and post-purchase support. This system enables multi-vendor order fulfillment while providing customers with transparent tracking and reliable service.

- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamline order processing across multiple sellers
- **Scalability**: Support high-volume order processing during peak periods
- **Customer Retention**: Enable seamless order management and issue resolution

### System Scope and Boundaries
The order management system handles:
- Order creation and validation
- Payment verification and confirmation
- Shipping carrier integration
- Real-time order tracking
- Customer service workflows
- Multi-seller coordination

**Excluded from scope**: Payment gateway implementation details, inventory management backend, seller product listing interfaces
