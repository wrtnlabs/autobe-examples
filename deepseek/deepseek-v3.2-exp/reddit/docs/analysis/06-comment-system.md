# Comment System Requirements

## 1. Introduction and System Overview

The comment system is a fundamental component of the Reddit-like community platform, enabling threaded discussions and user interactions around content. This system facilitates democratic conversation through nested replies, voting mechanisms, and community-driven content curation. The comment system integrates with user authentication, content ranking, karma calculation, and moderation systems to create a comprehensive discussion platform.

### 1.1 Business Context
Comments drive user engagement and community interaction by allowing users to express opinions, ask questions, and participate in discussions. The system balances free expression with content quality through voting mechanisms and moderation tools.

### 1.2 Scope and Purpose
This document specifies the complete business requirements for comment creation, nested replies, voting systems, ranking algorithms, moderation capabilities, and integration points with other platform components.

## 2. Comment Creation Requirements

```

### 2.2 Comment Creation Business Rules

**WHEN** a user creates a comment, **THE** system **SHALL** require the user to be authenticated with valid member status.

**WHEN** a user submits a comment, **THE** system **SHALL** validate comment content meets the following requirements:
- Comment text contains between 1 and 10,000 characters
- Comment does not contain prohibited content (spam, harassment, illegal material)
- User has not exceeded daily comment limit (100 comments per day)
- User has posting permissions in the target community

**WHERE** comment validation fails, **THE** system **SHALL** display specific error messages indicating the validation failure reason.

**WHEN** comment creation succeeds, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Create comment record with author, timestamp, and parent references
- Update post comment count immediately
- Display comment in the appropriate thread position
- Send notification to post author about new comment
- Update user comment statistics

### 2.3 Comment Editing and Deletion

**WHEN** a user edits their comment, **THE** system **SHALL** allow edits within 24 hours of original posting.

**WHEN** a user deletes their comment, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Remove comment content but preserve comment structure
- Display "[deleted]" placeholder with author information
- Maintain reply threads and voting history
- Update comment counts appropriately

**WHERE** a moderator removes a comment, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Remove comment content immediately
- Preserve removal reason and moderator information
- Notify comment author of removal with specific reason
- Log moderation action for audit purposes

## 3. Nested Reply System

### 3.1 Reply Structure Requirements

**THE** system **SHALL** support nested comment replies up to 6 levels deep to maintain readable conversation threads.

**WHEN** a user replies to a comment, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Create nested reply with proper parent-child relationship
- Maintain thread integrity and conversation flow
- Update parent comment reply count
- Display visual indentation to indicate nesting level

**WHERE** comment nesting reaches the maximum depth (6 levels), **THE** system **SHALL** prevent further nested replies and suggest starting a new thread.

### 3.2 Thread Management

**THE** system **SHALL** provide thread management features including:
- Collapse/expand comment threads
- "Load more replies" functionality for long threads
- Visual indicators for hidden replies
- Keyboard navigation through comment threads

**WHEN** viewing comment threads, **THE** system **SHALL**:

## 4. Comment Voting System

### 4.1 Voting Mechanism

**WHEN** an authenticated user views a comment, **THE** system **SHALL** display upvote and downvote buttons.

**WHEN** a user upvotes a comment, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Increment comment vote score by +1
- Update comment author karma by +1 point
- Record vote in user voting history
- Recalculate comment ranking position

**WHEN** a user downvotes a comment, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Decrement comment vote score by -1
- Update comment author karma by -1 point
- Record vote in user voting history
- Recalculate comment ranking position

**THE** system **SHALL** prevent users from voting on their own comments.

**THE** system **SHALL** allow users to change their vote on a comment:
- Changing from upvote to downvote: -2 to vote score
- Changing from downvote to upvote: +2 to vote score
- Removing vote: reverse previous vote impact

### 4.2 Vote Validation Rules

**THE** system **SHALL** ensure each user can only vote once per comment.

**THE** system **SHALL** track vote history to prevent vote manipulation.

**WHILE** processing votes, **THE** system **SHALL** update comment scores in real-time.

## 5. Comment Ranking Algorithms

### 5.1 Sorting Methods

**THE** system **SHALL** provide multiple comment sorting options:
- **Best**: Comments with highest positive engagement using Wilson score
- **Top**: Comments with highest net vote score
- **New**: Comments sorted by creation time (newest first)
- **Old**: Comments sorted by creation time (oldest first)
- **Controversial**: Comments with high vote counts but close scores

### 5.2 Best Comment Algorithm

**THE** system **SHALL** use Wilson score confidence interval for "Best" sorting:
- Considers both upvotes and downvotes
- Prioritizes comments with high positive engagement
- Balances new comments with established high-scoring comments
- Uses confidence interval to handle low vote counts

**THE** Wilson score formula **SHALL** be implemented as:
```
score = (p + z²/2n) / (1 + z²/n) ± z * sqrt((p(1-p) + z²/4n) / n) / (1 + z²/n)
Where:
- p = upvote ratio
- n = total votes
- z = confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence)
```

### 5.3 Top Comment Algorithm

**THE** system **SHALL** sort comments by net vote score (upvotes - downvotes) for "Top" sorting.

**WHERE** multiple comments have identical scores, **THE** system **SHALL** use creation time as tiebreaker (newer comments first).

### 5.4 Controversial Comment Algorithm

**THE** system **SHALL** identify controversial comments using the formula:
```
controversy_score = min(upvotes, downvotes) * total_votes / abs(upvotes - downvotes)
```

**WHERE** upvotes equal downvotes, **THE** system **SHALL** maximize controversy score.

## 6. Comment Karma System

### 6.1 Karma Calculation

**THE** system **SHALL** calculate comment karma based on net vote score.

**THE** system **SHALL** cap daily karma gain/loss per user to prevent manipulation:
- Maximum karma gain per day: 1000 points
- Maximum karma loss per day: 500 points

### 6.2 Karma Display

**THE** system **SHALL** display total user karma on user profiles.
