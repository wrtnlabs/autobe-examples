# Security and Compliance Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction and System Overview

This document defines the comprehensive security and compliance requirements for the Reddit-like community platform. The platform handles sensitive user data including personal information, authentication credentials, user-generated content, and community interactions, requiring robust security measures and compliance with global privacy regulations.
