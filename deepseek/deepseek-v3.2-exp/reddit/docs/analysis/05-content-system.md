# Content System Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary

This document defines the complete content system for the Reddit-like community platform, including post creation, voting mechanisms, karma calculation, and content ranking algorithms. The system enables users to create and share content within communities while providing community-driven content curation through voting and reputation systems.

```

### Vote Requirements

**WHEN a user votes on a post, THE system SHALL:**
- Verify user authentication and voting permissions
- Prevent self-voting on own content
- Allow only one vote per user per post
- Enable vote changing (upvote to downvote or vice versa)
- Prevent vote manipulation through multiple accounts

**THE voting system SHALL implement the following rules:**
- Upvote increases post score by +1
- Downvote decreases post score by -1
- Vote removal cancels previous vote effect
- Vote changes update the score accordingly
- Users can see their own vote status on each post

### Vote Validation Rules

**IF a user attempts to vote on their own content, THEN THE system SHALL:**
- Reject the vote with appropriate error message
- Maintain the post score unchanged
- Log the attempted self-vote for moderation

**WHILE a post is in removed or archived state, THE system SHALL:**
- Disable voting functionality
- Display appropriate status message
- Maintain existing vote counts for historical reference

### Vote Weighting System

**WHERE a user has high karma, THE system SHALL:**
- Apply karma-based vote weighting for controversial sorting
- Use karma as a trust metric in ranking algorithms
- Consider user reputation in spam detection

## Karma Calculation

### Karma Definition
User karma represents reputation earned through community participation and content quality.

### Karma Calculation Formulas

**Post Karma Calculation:**
```
post_karma = (upvotes - downvotes) * karma_multiplier
```

**Comment Karma Calculation:**
```
comment_karma = (upvotes - downvotes) * comment_multiplier
```

**Total User Karma:**
```
total_karma = sum(post_karma) + sum(comment_karma) - penalty_points
```

### Karma Multipliers

**THE karma calculation system SHALL apply the following multipliers:**
- Post karma multiplier: 1.0
- Comment karma multiplier: 0.5
- Award multiplier: 2.0 (for special community awards)
- Penalty multiplier: -1.0 (for removed content)

### Karma Update Triggers

**WHEN a post receives votes, THE system SHALL:**
- Update post author's karma in real-time
- Apply karma changes immediately
- Maintain karma history for auditing
- Cap negative karma at 0 for new users

**WHEN a comment receives votes, THE system SHALL:**
- Update comment author's karma
- Apply comment-specific multiplier
- Track comment karma separately from post karma

### Karma Display Rules

**THE system SHALL display karma as follows:**
- User profile shows total karma
- Post and comment pages show author karma
- Karma rounded to nearest whole number
- Negative karma displayed as 0 for new users (first 30 days)
- Karma breakdown available in user profile

## Content Ranking Algorithms

### Sorting Methods Overview

The platform provides multiple sorting algorithms to surface relevant content:

### Hot Sorting Algorithm

**THE hot sorting algorithm SHALL prioritize posts based on:**
- Vote score (upvotes - downvotes)
- Time decay factor (exponential)
- Comment activity
- View count engagement

**Hot Score Formula:**
```
hot_score = (log10(vote_score + 1) * sign(vote_score)) + 
            (comment_count * 0.1) + 
            (view_count * 0.001) - 
            (time_decay_factor)
```

**WHERE time_decay_factor = (current_time - post_time) / 45000**

### New Sorting Algorithm

**THE new sorting algorithm SHALL:**
- Sort posts by creation timestamp (newest first)
- Apply minimal time-based filtering
- Display posts within last 30 days by default
- Allow custom time range selection

### Top Sorting Algorithm

**THE top sorting algorithm SHALL:**
- Sort by highest net vote score (upvotes - downvotes)
- Apply time-based filtering options:
  - Past hour
  - Past 24 hours
  - Past week
  - Past month
  - Past year
  - All time
- Consider vote velocity for trending content

### Controversial Sorting Algorithm

**THE controversial sorting algorithm SHALL identify posts with:**
- High number of both upvotes and downvotes
- Significant comment engagement
- Polarizing community reaction

**Controversial Score Formula:**
```
controversial_score = (upvotes * downvotes) / (upvotes + downvotes) * 
                      (comment_count ^ 0.5) * 
                      karma_weight_factor
```

**WHERE karma_weight_factor considers voter reputation**

### Rising Sorting Algorithm

**THE rising sorting algorithm SHALL identify:**
- Posts with recent vote acceleration
- Content gaining popularity quickly
- Emerging community discussions

**Rising Score Formula:**
```
rising_score = (recent_votes / time_since_post) * 
               vote_velocity_factor * 
               comment_engagement_factor
```
