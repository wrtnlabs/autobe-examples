# Authentication Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the complete authentication requirements for the Reddit-like community platform. The authentication system serves as the foundation for user identity management, secure access control, and session management across all platform features. This system enables users to register, verify their identity, and securely access platform features based on their assigned roles.

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope
The authentication system provides secure user registration, login, and account management capabilities. It ensures that only authorized users can access platform features while maintaining data privacy and security compliance.

### 1.2 Relationship to User Roles
The authentication system works in conjunction with the defined user roles:
- **Guest**: Limited to registration and login access
- **Member**: Full authenticated user capabilities
- **Moderator**: Enhanced permissions within assigned communities
- **Admin**: System-wide administrative access

## 2. User Registration Process

### 2.1 Registration Requirements
WHEN a user attempts to register for the platform, THE system SHALL require the following information:
- Valid email address
- Unique username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only)
- Secure password (minimum 8 characters, containing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters)
- Agreement to platform terms of service and privacy policy

THE system SHALL validate username uniqueness in real-time during registration.
THE system SHALL validate email format and domain validity.
THE system SHALL prevent registration if any required field is invalid or missing.

### 2.2 Registration Validation
WHEN a user submits registration information, THE system SHALL:
- Validate email format and ensure it's not already registered
- Check username availability and format compliance
- Verify password meets security requirements
- Store user information in a pending state until email verification

THE system SHALL send an email verification link to the provided email address immediately after successful registration submission.

### 2.3 Account Activation
WHEN a user clicks the email verification link, THE system SHALL:
- Validate the verification token
- Activate the user account
- Assign the default "member" role
- Create the user's initial profile
- Redirect to the login page with success message

THE email verification link SHALL expire after 24 hours.
THE system SHALL allow users to request a new verification email if the original expires.

## 3. Login and Authentication Workflow

### 3.1 Credential-Based Authentication
WHEN a user attempts to log in, THE system SHALL accept either:
- Registered email address
- Registered username

THE system SHALL validate credentials against stored user information.
THE system SHALL implement secure password hashing using industry-standard algorithms.

### 3.2 Session Creation
WHEN authentication succeeds, THE system SHALL:
- Generate a JWT access token with 15-minute expiration
- Generate a refresh token with 7-day expiration
- Store session information securely
- Log the login event for security monitoring
- Redirect user to their personalized dashboard

THE JWT payload SHALL include:
- User ID
- Username
- Email address
- Assigned roles
- Permissions array
- Session creation timestamp

### 3.3 Login Attempt Security
THE system SHALL implement account lockout after 5 consecutive failed login attempts.
THE system SHALL automatically unlock accounts after 30 minutes.
THE system SHALL notify users via email after 3 failed login attempts.
THE system SHALL log all login attempts for security monitoring.

## 4. Password Management System

### 4.1 Password Security Requirements
THE system SHALL enforce password requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters length
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character
- Cannot contain the username or email address
- Must be different from previous 5 passwords

THE system SHALL store passwords using secure hashing with salt.
THE system SHALL never store passwords in plain text.

### 4.2 Password Reset Process
WHEN a user requests password reset, THE system SHALL:
- Validate the provided email address exists in the system
- Generate a secure, time-limited reset token
- Send password reset instructions to the registered email
- Log the password reset request for security monitoring

THE password reset token SHALL expire after 1 hour.
THE system SHALL allow only one active reset token per user at a time.

### 4.3 Password Change Process
WHEN an authenticated user changes their password, THE system SHALL:
- Require current password verification
- Validate new password meets security requirements
- Update password hash in the database
- Invalidate all existing sessions (force re-login)
- Send confirmation email to the user
- Log the password change event

## 5. Email Verification System

### 5.1 Initial Email Verification
THE system SHALL require email verification before granting full platform access.
THE system SHALL send verification emails immediately after registration.
THE email verification message SHALL include:
- User's username
- Verification link with secure token
- Instructions for completing verification
- Support contact information for issues

### 5.2 Verification Expiration and Resend
THE email verification token SHALL be valid for 24 hours.
WHEN a verification token expires, THE system SHALL allow users to request a new verification email.
THE system SHALL limit verification email resends to 3 per hour per email address.

### 5.3 Account Status Management
WHILE an account is unverified, THE system SHALL restrict user capabilities to:
- Accessing the login page
- Requesting new verification emails
- Viewing public content (read-only)

WHEN an account becomes verified, THE system SHALL grant full member capabilities.

## 6. Account Recovery and Security

### 6.1 Password Recovery Workflow
WHEN a user initiates password recovery, THE system SHALL:
- Send recovery instructions to the registered email
- Provide a secure recovery link with time-limited token
- Allow password reset upon token validation
- Require the user to log in with new credentials
- Send confirmation of successful password change

### 6.2 Account Security Features
THE system SHALL provide users with security features:
- View recent login activity and locations
- See active sessions and devices
- Ability to terminate specific sessions
- Option to log out from all devices
- Security event notifications

### 6.3 Session Termination
WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL:
- Invalidate the current session token
- Clear session data from the client
- Redirect to the login page
- Log the logout event

WHEN a user terminates all sessions, THE system SHALL:
- Invalidate all active tokens for the user
- Require fresh login on next access
- Send email notification of session termination
- Log the security event

## 7. User Session Management

### 7.1 JWT Token Implementation
THE system SHALL use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
THE access token SHALL expire after 15 minutes of inactivity.
THE refresh token SHALL expire after 7 days of inactivity.

WHEN an access token expires, THE system SHALL:
- Automatically refresh using the refresh token
- Generate new access token without requiring user interaction
- Maintain user session continuity

### 7.2 Session Refresh Mechanism
THE system SHALL implement secure token refresh:
- Refresh tokens can only be used to obtain new access tokens

- New refresh tokens are issued with each refresh cycle
- Refresh tokens have longer expiration than access tokens

### 7.3 Device and Location Tracking
THE system SHALL track session information:
- Device type and browser information
- IP address and approximate location
- Session creation and last activity timestamps
- Login success/failure history

THE system SHALL display active sessions to users in their security settings.

- Role upgrades (to moderator/admin) require additional verification
- Role-based permissions are enforced in JWT tokens
- Session tokens are reissued when roles change

## 9. Error Handling and User Experience

### 9.1 Registration Errors
IF registration validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL:
- Display specific error messages for each validation failure
- Preserve entered form data (except passwords)
