# Reddit-like Community Platform
## Comprehensive Table of Contents

## Document Overview

### Introduction
This document provides the complete table of contents and navigation guide for the Reddit-like community platform project documentation. The platform aims to create a community-driven content sharing and discussion system where users can create communities, share content, engage through voting and commenting, and build reputation through participation.

### Core Value Proposition
The platform enables users to:
- Create and participate in niche communities (subreddits)
- Share diverse content types (text, links, images)
- Engage through democratic voting systems
- Build reputation through karma accumulation
- Discover content through intelligent sorting algorithms
- Moderate communities through user-driven governance

### Target Audience
The platform serves three primary user segments:
1. **Content Consumers**: Users who browse, vote, and comment on content
2. **Content Creators**: Users who create posts and build communities
3. **Community Moderators**: Users who manage and maintain community standards

### Business Goals
- Build a scalable community platform with viral growth potential
- Establish user-driven content moderation and governance
- Create sustainable engagement through karma and reputation systems
- Enable niche community formation around diverse interests
- Generate value through user-generated content and interactions

### Success Metrics
- Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Daily Active Users (DAU)
- User engagement metrics (posts, comments, votes per user)
- Community growth and diversity
- User retention and churn rates
- Content quality and moderation effectiveness
