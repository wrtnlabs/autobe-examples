# User Roles and Authentication Requirements

## Introduction and Overview

This document establishes the complete user role structure and authentication requirements for the Reddit-like community platform. The authentication system forms the foundation for all user interactions, content management, and community governance within the platform.

### Purpose and Scope

The user role system defines hierarchical permissions that enable scalable community management while maintaining platform security. Each role represents a distinct level of responsibility and capability within the system, from anonymous browsing to full administrative control.

### Business Context

User authentication and role management are critical for maintaining community quality, enforcing content guidelines, and providing appropriate user experiences based on participation level and responsibilities.

## User Role Hierarchy

The platform implements a four-tier role hierarchy that balances user empowerment with responsible content management:

    B --> D["Platform Administrator"]

        E["Unauthenticated Guest"] --> F["Registered Member"]
        F --> G["Community Moderator"]
        F --> H["Platform Administrator"]
    end
```
