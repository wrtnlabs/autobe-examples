# Community Moderation and Reporting System Requirements

## Introduction & System Overview

The moderation system provides comprehensive tools for maintaining community safety, enforcing content guidelines, and managing user behavior across the Reddit-like platform. This system enables both automated and human-driven content moderation through a structured workflow that balances community autonomy with platform-wide standards.

### Business Context
A robust moderation system is essential for maintaining platform quality, preventing abuse, and ensuring a positive user experience. The system must support both community-level moderation by designated moderators and platform-level oversight by administrators.

## Content Reporting System

### Reportable Content Types
Users can report various types of inappropriate content through a standardized reporting interface:

**WHEN** a user identifies inappropriate content, **THE** system **SHALL** provide reporting options for:
- Spam or unwanted commercial content
- Harassment or personal attacks
- Hate speech or discriminatory content
- Illegal content or activities
- Personal information exposure
- Impersonation or fake accounts
- Content that violates community-specific rules

### Reporting Workflow

  F --> G["Notify Moderators"]
  G --> H["Add to Moderation Queue"]
  H --> I["Prioritize Based on Severity"]
  I --> J["Await Moderator Review"]
```

**WHEN** a user submits a report, **THE** system **SHALL**:
1. Record the report timestamp, reporter identity, and reported content
2. Assign a unique report ID for tracking
3. Add the report to the appropriate moderation queue
4. Notify relevant moderators based on community assignment
5. Maintain reporter anonymity from the reported user

**WHEN** multiple users report the same content, **THE** system **SHALL** consolidate reports and increase priority in the moderation queue.

### Report Categories and Severity Levels
| Report Category | Severity Level | Response Time Target | Auto-Action Threshold |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Spam/Commercial | Medium | 24 hours | 5+ reports triggers auto-removal |
| Harassment | High | 4 hours | 3+ reports triggers review priority |
| Hate Speech | Critical | 1 hour | 2+ reports triggers immediate review |
| Illegal Content | Critical | 15 minutes | 1 report triggers immediate review |
| Personal Info | High | 2 hours | 2+ reports triggers auto-removal |
| Impersonation | Medium | 12 hours | Manual review required |
