/**
 * Test that an employee can soft-delete their own draft timesheet.
 *
 * Validates the timesheet erase operation for the happy path where an employee deletes their own timesheet while it is still in draft status. The erase endpoint returns void — the server internally sets the deleted_at timestamp, unlinks all associated timelogs by clearing their timesheet_id references, and excludes the timesheet from future listing and retrieval operations.
 *
 * Since the endpoint returns no response body, this test verifies that the operation completes without throwing an error, confirming that the timesheet was accepted for soft deletion under valid conditions.
 *
 * 1. Register a new member and authenticate with JWT tokens.
 * 2. Create a draft timesheet for a calendar week via the generation utility.
 * 3. Delete the draft timesheet using the erase endpoint — verify no error occurs.
