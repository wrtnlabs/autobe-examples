 * Test successful project deletion when no timelogs are associated.
 *
 * Verifies that a project with no associated timelogs can be successfully deleted by a member holding project:manage permission. The test creates a clean project with no time entries or child data, then deletes it and confirms the operation succeeds without errors.
 *
 * 1. Member authenticates via join to establish a session with project:manage permissions within the default organization.
 * 2. Member creates a project in active status with a random name, hex color code, and optional description.
 * 3. Member deletes the project by its ID and confirms the operation completes without throwing.
