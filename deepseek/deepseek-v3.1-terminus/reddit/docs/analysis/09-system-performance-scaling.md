# Reddit-style Community Platform - System Performance and Scaling Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document defines comprehensive performance requirements, scalability strategies, and system architecture constraints for the Reddit-like community platform. The platform must deliver responsive user experiences under varying load conditions while supporting exponential growth through robust scaling mechanisms and performance optimization techniques.
