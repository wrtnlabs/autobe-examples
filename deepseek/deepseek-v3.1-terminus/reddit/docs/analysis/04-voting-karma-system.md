## Core Voting System Requirements

### Voting Interface and User Interaction

**WHEN** a member views a post or comment, **THE** system **SHALL** display voting buttons with clear upvote/downvote indicators and current score display.

**WHEN** a member clicks the upvote button on content, **THE** system **SHALL** immediately increment the score by 1 and provide visual feedback confirming the vote.

**WHEN** a member clicks the downvote button on content, **THE** system **SHALL** immediately decrement the score by 1 and provide visual feedback confirming the vote.

**IF** a member attempts to vote on their own content, **THEN THE** system **SHALL** prevent the vote and display the message: "You cannot vote on your own content."

### Vote State Management

**WHILE** a user is viewing content, **THE** system **SHALL** visually indicate the user's current vote state using distinct colors and icons for upvoted, downvoted, and neutral states.

**WHEN** a user changes their vote from upvote to downvote or vice versa, **THE** system **SHALL** update the vote state immediately and recalculate the total score with a net change of 2 points.

**THE** system **SHALL** maintain vote history for each user-content interaction, tracking vote timestamps and changes for moderation and analytics purposes.

### Voting Access Control

**IF** a user attempts to vote on content they cannot access due to community restrictions, **THEN THE** system **SHALL** deny the vote and log the unauthorized access attempt for security monitoring.

**WHERE** content has been deleted or removed by moderators, **THE** system **SHALL** preserve existing vote records but prevent new votes from being cast.

**WHEN** a user's voting privileges are suspended due to community rules violations, **THE** system **SHALL** disable voting functionality and display the suspension duration to the user.

## Karma Calculation and Management

### Karma Accumulation Rules

**WHEN** a user's post receives an upvote from another user, **THE** system **SHALL** add 1 karma point to the post author's total karma score.

**WHEN** a user's post receives a downvote from another user, **THE** system **SHALL** subtract 1 karma point from the post author's total karma score.

**WHEN** a user's comment receives an upvote from another user, **THE** system **SHALL** add 1 karma point to the comment author's total karma score.

**WHEN** a user's comment receives a downvote from another user, **THE** system **SHALL** subtract 1 karma point from the comment author's total karma score.

### Karma Calculation Algorithm

**THE** system **SHALL** calculate total karma using the formula: 
```
Total Karma = (Post Upvotes - Post Downvotes) + (Comment Upvotes - Comment Downvotes) - Penalty Points
```

**THE** system **SHALL** maintain separate karma totals for post karma and comment karma, providing users with detailed breakdowns of their contribution types.

**WHERE** a user receives multiple votes on the same piece of content, **THE** system **SHALL** count each individual vote toward the karma calculation, regardless of when the votes occur.

### Karma Display and Visibility

**WHEN** displaying user profiles to other users, **THE** system **SHALL** show the user's total karma score prominently near the username.

**WHILE** users view their own profile statistics, **THE** system **SHALL** display detailed karma breakdowns showing post karma, comment karma, and award karma separately.

**THE** system **SHALL** update karma scores in real-time as votes are cast, ensuring users see immediate feedback on their reputation changes.

## Reputation and Achievement System

### Reputation Tiers and User Classification

    A["New User<br/>0-99 Karma"] --> B["Active Member<br/>100-999 Karma"]
    B --> C["Trusted Member<br/>1,000-4,999 Karma"]
    C --> D["Community Leader<br/>5,000+ Karma"]
    
    A --> E["Basic Voting Rights"]
    B --> F["Community Creation"]
    C --> G["Moderation Priority"]
    D --> H["Platform Influence"]
```

**WHILE** a user's total karma remains below 100 points, **THE** system **SHALL** classify them as "New User" with basic platform access privileges.

**WHILE** a user's total karma is between 100 and 999 points, **THE** system **SHALL** classify them as "Active Member" with community creation capabilities.

**WHILE** a user's total karma is between 1,000 and 4,999 points, **THE** system **SHALL** classify them as "Trusted Member" with priority in content moderation queues.

**WHERE** a user's total karma exceeds 5,000 points, **THE** system **SHALL** grant them "Community Leader" status with platform-wide influence recognition.

### Achievement Badges and Recognition

**WHEN** a user reaches 100 total karma points, **THE** system **SHALL** automatically award the "Contributor" badge and notify the user of this milestone achievement.

**WHEN** a user receives 10 or more upvotes on a single post, **THE** system **SHALL** award the "Popular Post" badge and highlight the achievement in the user's profile.

**WHEN** a user maintains positive karma (above 0) for 30 consecutive days, **THE** system **SHALL** award the "Consistent Contributor" badge recognizing their sustained quality contributions.

**THE** system **SHALL** provide visual badge displays on user profiles, with hover-over tooltips explaining the achievement criteria for each badge earned.

### Reputation-Based Privileges

**WHERE** a user achieves "Trusted Member" status with 1,000+ karma, **THE** system **SHALL** enable advanced community management features including custom community styles and enhanced moderation tools.

**WHERE** a user attains "Community Leader" status with 5,000+ karma, **THE** system **SHALL** grant them priority access to new platform features and inclusion in community feedback programs.

**WHEN** high-karma users participate in content discussions, **THE** system **SHALL** visually distinguish their contributions with special reputation indicators that build trust with other community members.

## User Incentive Mechanisms

### Content Quality Incentives

**THE** system **SHALL** prioritize content from high-karma users in recommendation algorithms, giving quality contributors increased visibility for their posts and comments.

**WHEN** a user's content receives significant positive engagement, **THE** system **SHALL** provide temporary visibility boosts that increase the content's reach within relevant communities.

**WHERE** users consistently contribute valuable content, **THE** system **SHALL** feature their best contributions in community highlight sections and trending topic displays.

### Participation Rewards and Gamification

**WHEN** users maintain active participation through regular voting and commenting, **THE** system **SHALL** increase their voting weight incrementally based on participation consistency.

**THE** system **SHALL** implement karma milestones with special visual recognition, including profile flair changes and exclusive achievement badges for significant karma thresholds (100, 1k, 5k, 10k, etc.).

**WHERE** users demonstrate expertise in specific community topics, **THE** system **SHALL** award topic-specific badges that recognize their specialized knowledge and contributions.

### Anti-Gaming and Manipulation Protections

**IF** the system detects coordinated vote manipulation patterns between users, **THEN THE** system **SHALL** automatically nullify suspicious votes and apply karma penalties to involved accounts.

**WHERE** users engage in reciprocal voting (you upvote me, I upvote you), **THE** system **SHALL** detect these patterns using relationship analysis and reduce the karma impact of such votes.

**WHEN** the system identifies vote bot activity or artificial engagement, **THE** system **SHALL** immediately suspend voting privileges and initiate account review procedures.

## Vote Weighting and Impact Algorithms

### Vote Weight Calculation System

**THE** system **SHALL** calculate vote weight based on a combination of user karma and account maturity factors using the formula:
```
Vote Weight = Base Weight × Karma Multiplier × Account Age Factor
```

**WHILE** a user account is less than 30 days old, **THE** system **SHALL** apply a reduced vote weight of 0.5 to prevent new account manipulation.

**WHILE** a user has moderate karma (100-999 points), **THE** system **SHALL** apply the standard vote weight of 1.0 for balanced community influence.

**WHILE** a user has high karma (1,000+ points), **THE** system **SHALL** apply an increased vote weight of 1.5 to recognize their established community credibility.

### Content Score Calculation

**THE** system **SHALL** calculate post and comment scores using the formula:
```
Content Score = Σ(Upvotes × Voter Weight) - Σ(Downvotes × Voter Weight)
```

**WHERE** content receives rapid engagement shortly after posting, **THE** system **SHALL** apply velocity multipliers that temporarily boost content visibility in sorting algorithms.

**THE** system **SHALL** use weighted voting in content sorting algorithms to ensure that votes from credible users have greater impact on content positioning.

### Hot Algorithm Implementation

**THE** system **SHALL** implement a Reddit-style hot algorithm for content sorting using the formula:
```
Hot Score = (log10(Score) + (Seconds Since Submission / 45000)) × Gravity Factor
```

**WHERE** Gravity Factor decreases over time, **THE** system **SHALL** balance vote score with time decay to promote recent popular content while maintaining quality older content visibility.

**THE** hot algorithm **SHALL** update scores every 15 minutes to ensure real-time accuracy in content positioning across community feeds.

## Performance and Scalability Requirements
