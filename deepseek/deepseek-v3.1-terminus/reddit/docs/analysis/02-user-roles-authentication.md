# User Roles and Authentication System Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document defines the complete authentication and authorization system for the Reddit-like community platform. The system implements a role-based access control (RBAC) model with four distinct user roles: Guest, Member, Moderator, and Administrator. The authentication system uses JWT tokens for secure session management and provides comprehensive permission matrices to enforce access control across all platform features.

## User Role Definitions

### Guest Role
Unauthenticated users who access the platform without registration. Guests have limited read-only access to public content.
