## Content Reporting System Requirements

### User Reporting Interface

**WHEN** a user identifies inappropriate content, **THE** system **SHALL** provide reporting options with the following capabilities:

**WHEN** reporting a post or comment, **THE** system **SHALL** present a modal interface with:
- Report reason selection (harassment, spam, rule violation, etc.)
- Additional context text field for user explanation
- Preview of the reported content
- Optional evidence upload (screenshots, links)
- Anonymous reporting option for sensitive cases

**WHERE** the reporting user is the content author, **THE** system **SHALL** provide self-reporting options for content removal requests.

### Reporting Workflow

**WHEN** a report is submitted, **THE** system **SHALL**:
1. Log the report with timestamp, reporter information, and content reference
2. Assign initial priority based on report type and severity
3. Notify appropriate moderators based on community assignment
4. Create moderation ticket in the moderation queue

**IF** multiple users report the same content, **THEN THE** system **SHALL** aggregate reports and increase priority level.

**WHILE** a report is pending review, **THE** system **SHALL** track the following metrics:
- Time since report submission
- Number of similar reports
- Content engagement metrics
- User history of the content author

## Moderation Workflows

### Moderator Dashboard Requirements

**THE** moderation dashboard **SHALL** provide moderators with:
- Prioritized queue of reported content
- Quick action buttons (approve, remove, escalate, ignore)
- Content preview with full context
- User history and previous moderation actions
- Community-specific guidelines reference
- Bulk moderation capabilities for similar content

### Moderation Decision Process

**WHEN** a moderator reviews reported content, **THE** system **SHALL** require:
1. **Content Evaluation**: Review of the actual content and context
2. **Guideline Assessment**: Comparison against community and platform rules
3. **User History Check**: Review of content author's previous violations
4. **Action Selection**: Choose appropriate moderation action
5. **Reason Documentation**: Record detailed reason for the decision

**Moderation Action Options**:
- **Approve**: Content remains visible, report marked as resolved
- **Remove**: Content hidden from public view with removal reason
- **Warning**: Content remains visible with warning to author
- **Temporary Ban**: User restricted from posting for specified duration
- **Permanent Ban**: User account suspended from the community
- **Escalate**: Send to higher-level moderators or administrators

### Escalation Procedures

**IF** a moderator receives content that violates platform-wide rules, **THEN THE** system **SHALL** provide escalation to platform administrators.

**WHERE** content involves legal or safety concerns, **THE** system **SHALL** implement immediate escalation protocols with highest priority.

## Automated Content Filtering

### Rule-Based Filtering System

**THE** system **SHALL** implement automated filtering for:
- **Spam Detection**: Pattern matching for spam content and links
- **Banned Words**: Keyword filtering for prohibited content
- **Duplicate Content**: Detection of repeated or copied content
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of content flooding from single users

**WHEN** automated filtering identifies potential violations, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Flag content for moderator review
- Apply temporary visibility restrictions if high confidence
- Log filtering decisions for transparency
- Provide appeal mechanisms for false positives

### Machine Learning Detection

**WHERE** machine learning models are implemented, **THE** system **SHALL**:
- Continuously train on moderator decisions
- Provide confidence scores for automated actions
- Maintain human oversight for all automated removals
- Regularly audit model performance and bias

**IF** ML models achieve high confidence scores, **THEN THE** system **SHALL** allow automated actions with mandatory post-review.

## Community Guidelines Enforcement

### Guideline Hierarchy

**THE** system **SHALL** maintain a hierarchical guideline structure:
1. **Platform-Wide Rules**: Universal content policies
2. **Community-Specific Guidelines**: Rules defined by community moderators
3. **Content-Type Restrictions**: Limitations based on content format

**WHEN** community guidelines conflict with platform rules, **THEN THE** system **SHALL** enforce the stricter standard.

### Transparency and Documentation

**THE** system **SHALL** provide public documentation of:
- All platform-wide rules and guidelines
- Moderation statistics for each community
- Appeal success rates and common reasons
- Guideline update history and change logs

**WHERE** content is removed, **THE** system **SHALL** display removal reasons to users when appropriate.

## Appeal and Review Process

### User Appeal System

**WHEN** a user receives moderation action, **THE** system **SHALL** provide appeal options:
- **Appeal Form**: Structured form for explaining appeal reasons
- **Evidence Upload**: Capability to provide additional context
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time tracking of appeal progress
- **Communication Channel**: Direct messaging with moderators

### Appeal Review Workflow

**WHEN** an appeal is submitted, **THE** system **SHALL**:
1. Notify original moderators of the appeal
2. Escalate to senior moderators if unresolved
3. Provide full context of original moderation decision
4. Track response time and resolution metrics

**IF** an appeal is successful, **THEN THE** system **SHALL**:
- Restore content with appropriate visibility
- Remove moderation strikes from user record
- Document the appeal resolution for future reference
- Notify all involved parties of the outcome

### Moderator Review System

**THE** system **SHALL** implement moderator performance monitoring:
- Decision consistency metrics
- Appeal success rates by moderator
- Response time tracking
- User satisfaction with moderation
