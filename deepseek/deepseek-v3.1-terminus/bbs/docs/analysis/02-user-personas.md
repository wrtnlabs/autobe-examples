# User Personas Documentation - Economic/Political Discussion Board

## Document Overview

This document defines the complete user personas and authentication requirements for the economic/political discussion board platform. It provides detailed profiles for each user role, their interaction patterns, and the authentication system specifications required for backend implementation.

## Executive Summary

The economic/political discussion board supports four distinct user roles with progressively increasing permissions. Each role has specific capabilities and limitations designed to maintain discussion quality while ensuring platform security. The authentication system uses JWT tokens to manage user sessions and role-based access control.

## User Role Definitions and Hierarchy

### Role Hierarchy Structure

The system implements a hierarchical role structure where each role inherits all permissions from lower roles:

    A["Guest"] --> B["Member"]
    B --> C["Moderator"]
    C --> D["Administrator"]
```

### Detailed User Role Specifications

## Integration with Other Documents

This user persona document integrates with:
- [Service Vision Document](./01-service-vision.md) for business context alignment
- [User Journey Documentation](./03-user-journey.md) for detailed interaction flows
- [Functional Requirements](./04-functional-requirements.md) for implementation specifications
- [Business Rules Document](./05-business-rules.md) for permission enforcement logic

Each persona definition provides the foundation for corresponding features in the functional requirements document, ensuring consistent user experience across all platform interactions.

## Success Metrics

User persona implementation success will be measured by:
- **User Registration Conversion Rate**: Target 15% conversion from guest to member
- **Member Engagement Metrics**: Target 5+ posts per active user monthly
- **Moderation Effectiveness**: Target <2% of content requiring moderator intervention
- **Administrator Efficiency**: Target <15 minutes average user management time
- **Authentication Success Rate**: Target 99.5% successful login attempts

These metrics will validate that the persona definitions accurately reflect user needs and support effective platform operation.

## Authentication System Performance Requirements

**Response Time Standards**:
- WHEN user attempts login, THE system SHALL respond within 2 seconds
- WHERE JWT token validation is required, THE system SHALL complete within 500ms
- WHEN session refresh is initiated, THE system SHALL provide new token within 1 second

**Security Requirements**:
- THE authentication system SHALL prevent brute force attacks with rate limiting
- WHERE suspicious activity is detected, THE system SHALL implement additional security checks
- THE system SHALL maintain audit logs of all authentication attempts

**Recovery Processes**:
- WHEN password reset is requested, THE system SHALL send secure reset link within 1 minute
- IF account recovery fails, THE system SHALL provide customer support escalation path
- WHERE authentication tokens are compromised, THE system SHALL support token revocation
