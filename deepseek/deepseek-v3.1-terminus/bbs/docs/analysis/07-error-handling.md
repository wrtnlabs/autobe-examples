# 07-error-handling.md - Comprehensive Error Handling Requirements

## 1. Error Handling Framework Overview

This document defines the comprehensive error handling strategy for the economic/political discussion board. The platform must provide clear, helpful error messages and recovery paths that maintain user confidence even when technical issues occur.

### 1.1 Error Handling Philosophy
- **Transparency**: Users should understand what went wrong and why
- **Guidance**: Every error should provide clear next steps for resolution
- **Consistency**: Error handling patterns should be predictable across the platform
- **Graceful Degradation**: The system should remain partially functional during errors

## 2. Authentication Error Scenarios

### 2.1 Login Failures

**WHEN a user attempts to login with invalid credentials, THE system SHALL display appropriate error messages without revealing whether the username or password is incorrect.**

**Error Scenarios and Recovery Requirements:**
- **Invalid username/email format**: 
  - WHEN email format is invalid, THE system SHALL display: "Please check your email format and try again."
  - THE system SHALL provide email format examples: "name@example.com"

- **Incorrect password**:
  - WHEN password is incorrect, THE system SHALL display: "The credentials you entered are incorrect. Please try again."
  - THE system SHALL provide "Forgot Password" link with immediate access

- **Account not found**:
  - WHEN account doesn't exist, THE system SHALL display: "No account found with this email. Would you like to create one?"
  - THE system SHALL offer registration option with pre-filled email

- **Account temporarily locked**:
  - AFTER 5 failed login attempts, THE system SHALL implement 15-minute account lockout

  - WHEN token validation fails, THE system SHALL immediately invalidate session
  - THE system SHALL redirect to login with security message: "Security verification failed. Please log in again."

- **Concurrent session conflicts**:
  - WHEN multiple sessions detected, THE system SHALL allow user to choose active session
  - THE system SHALL provide option to log out other sessions

### 2.3 Registration and Account Validation Errors

**IF user registration data fails validation, THEN THE system SHALL provide specific feedback for each field.**

**Registration Validation Flow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A["User Submits Registration"] --> B["Validate Email Format"]
    B --> C["Check Password Strength"]
    C --> D["Verify Username Availability"]
    D --> E["Check Email Uniqueness"]
    E --> F{"All Validations Pass?"}
    F -->|"Yes"| G["Create Account Successfully"]
    F -->|"No"| H["Display Field-Specific Errors"]
    H --> I["Preserve Valid Form Data"]
    I --> J["Highlight Problem Fields"]
    J --> K["Allow Immediate Correction"]
    K --> A
```

**Specific Validation Requirements:**
