# Data Entities and Relationships Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all data entities and their relationships for the Economic/Political Discussion Board platform. The system manages four core business entities: Users, Posts, Comments, and Categories, with supporting entities for moderation and analytics. All entities are designed to support robust discussion capabilities while maintaining data integrity and business rule enforcement.

## Core Business Entities Overview

### Primary Entities
1. **User Entity**: Manages user authentication, profiles, and permissions
2. **Post Entity**: Handles discussion topics and content management
3. **Comment Entity**: Supports threaded discussions and replies
4. **Category Entity**: Organizes content by economic/political topics

### Supporting Entities
5. **Moderation Entity**: Tracks content reviews and user reports
6. **Analytics Entity**: Monitors platform usage and engagement metrics

## Enhanced User Entity Analysis

### User Attributes and Business Requirements

**THE system SHALL maintain user profiles with the following attributes:**
- User ID (unique identifier, format: UUIDv4)
- Username (display name, 3-30 characters, alphanumeric only)
- Email address (valid format, used for authentication and notifications)
- Registration date and time (ISO 8601 format)
- Last login timestamp (tracked for security monitoring)
- User role (guest, member, moderator, admin with hierarchical permissions)
- Profile status (active, suspended, banned with status duration)
- Email verification status (pending, verified, expired)
- Profile completion percentage (tracked for user onboarding)

**User Lifecycle Management Business Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: New User Registration**
- WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL validate email format and send verification within 2 seconds
- WHERE email verification succeeds, THE system SHALL grant full member privileges immediately
- IF email verification fails, THEN THE system SHALL allow resend attempts every 5 minutes

**Scenario 2: User Role Promotion**
- WHEN a member demonstrates consistent quality contributions, THE system SHALL consider role promotion
- WHERE moderation needs increase, THE system SHALL automatically flag active members for moderator training
- IF promotion criteria are met, THEN THE system SHALL notify administrators for final approval

**Scenario 3: Account Suspension Process**
- WHEN a user violates community guidelines, THE system SHALL apply progressive suspension periods
- WHERE repeated violations occur, THE system SHALL escalate from warning to temporary suspension
- IF severe violations are detected, THEN THE system SHALL implement immediate account suspension pending review
