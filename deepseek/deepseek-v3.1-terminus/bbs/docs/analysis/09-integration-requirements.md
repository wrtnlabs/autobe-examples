## Data Export and Compliance

### Data Portability Requirements

**WHEN users request their data, THE system SHALL provide comprehensive export functionality.**

**Export Requirements:**
- THE data export SHALL include all user posts, comments, and preferences in JSON format
- WHERE large datasets exceed 10MB, THE system SHALL provide cloud storage download links
- THE export process SHALL complete within 24 hours for standard requests
- WHEN GDPR compliance is required, THE system SHALL provide data deletion within 30 days of request

**Backup Integration:**
