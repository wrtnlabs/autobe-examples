# Order Tracking and Fulfillment System Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive order tracking system for the e-commerce shopping mall platform. The system provides real-time visibility into order status from placement through final delivery, ensuring customers receive accurate tracking information while enabling sellers to efficiently manage order fulfillment. The tracking system integrates with shipping carriers, payment processors, and customer communication channels to deliver a seamless post-purchase experience.

### Business Value Proposition
WHEN customers place orders, THE system SHALL provide transparent tracking that builds trust and reduces customer service inquiries. THE platform SHALL deliver real-time status updates that keep customers informed throughout their purchasing journey.

## Order Status Lifecycle Management

### Comprehensive Status Definitions

THE order tracking system SHALL maintain the following order status progression with clear business rules:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A["Order Placed"] --> B["Payment Processing"]
    B --> C["Payment Confirmed"]
    C --> D["Order Processing"]
    D --> E["Ready for Shipment"]
    E --> F["Shipped"]
    F --> G["In Transit"]
    G --> H["Out for Delivery"]
    H --> I["Delivered"]
    
    C -.->|"Payment Failed"| J["Payment Error"]
    D -.->|"Inventory Issues"| K["On Hold"]
    E -.->|"Shipping Delay"| L["Delivery Exception"]
    H -.->|"Failed Delivery"| M["Delivery Attempt Failed"]

    J --> O["Payment Retry Required"]
    O --> B
    K --> P["Inventory Restocked"]
    P --> D
    L --> Q["Carrier Investigation"]
    Q --> G
```

### Status Transition Rules

**WHEN an order transitions between statuses, THE system SHALL enforce the following business rules:**

- **FROM "Order Placed" TO "Payment Processing"**: Automatically triggered upon order submission
- **FROM "Payment Processing" TO "Payment Confirmed"**: Requires successful payment authorization
- **FROM "Payment Confirmed" TO "Order Processing"**: Inventory reservation and seller notification
- **FROM "Order Processing" TO "Ready for Shipment"**: Seller marks order as prepared for shipping
- **FROM "Ready for Shipment" TO "Shipped"**: Tracking number generated and carrier pickup confirmed
- **FROM "Shipped" TO "In Transit"**: Carrier confirms package movement in their system
- **FROM "In Transit" TO "Out for Delivery"**: Package on final delivery vehicle
- **FROM "Out for Delivery" TO "Delivered"**: Carrier confirms successful delivery

**IF status transitions violate business rules, THEN THE system SHALL prevent the transition and log the violation attempt.**

## Real-Time Tracking Integration

### Tracking Data Architecture

THE tracking system SHALL maintain real-time synchronization with carrier systems through API integration:
