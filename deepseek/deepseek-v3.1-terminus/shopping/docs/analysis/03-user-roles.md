# User Roles and Authentication System

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the comprehensive user authentication and role management system for the e-commerce shopping mall platform. The system provides secure, role-based access to platform features while maintaining user privacy and data protection.

## 2. User Authentication System

### 2.1 Core Authentication Functions

**User Registration Process**

  A["Start Registration"] --> B["Collect User Information"]
  B --> C["Validate Email Address"]
  C --> D["Create User Account"]
  D --> E["Send Verification Email"]
  E --> F["Account Activation"]
  F --> G["Complete Profile Setup"]
  G --> H["Access Granted"]
```

**EARS Requirements for Authentication:**
- WHEN a user attempts to register, THE system SHALL validate email format and uniqueness
- THE system SHALL require email verification before account activation
- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL authenticate credentials within 2 seconds
