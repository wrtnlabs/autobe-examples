### Information Flow

The documentation follows a logical progression from business strategy to technical implementation:

1. **Business Foundation** (Documents 01-02): Establishes why the platform exists and how it generates revenue
2. **Platform Core** (Documents 03-05): Defines who uses the platform and what they manage
3. **Transaction Engine** (Documents 06-10): Specifies how buying and selling operations work
4. **Customer Experience** (Documents 11-13): Details post-purchase engagement and support
5. **Administration & Integration** (Documents 14-15): Covers platform management and external connections

### Cross-Referencing Conventions

All documents follow consistent linking patterns:
- **Business requirements** reference foundational documents
