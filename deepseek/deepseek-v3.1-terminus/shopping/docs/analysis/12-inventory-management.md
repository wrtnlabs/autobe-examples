# Inventory Management System Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive inventory management system for the e-commerce shopping mall platform. The system provides real-time SKU-level inventory tracking, automated stock alerts, multi-location inventory management, and robust reporting capabilities to ensure optimal stock levels and prevent overselling while maintaining complete integration with order processing, seller management, and customer experience systems.

### Business Context
Inventory management serves as the critical bridge between customer demand and product availability. The system must maintain perfect synchronization between physical stock levels and digital product availability while supporting complex business operations including supplier management, seasonal demand fluctuations, and multi-channel sales integration.

## Core Inventory System
