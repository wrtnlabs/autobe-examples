# E-commerce Shopping Mall Platform - User Management System Requirements

## 1. Executive Summary and Business Context

This document defines the complete user management system for the e-commerce shopping mall platform. The system supports comprehensive user lifecycle management from registration through account management, personalization, and eventual account closure. The platform serves four distinct user roles: Guests, Customers, Sellers, and Administrators, each with tailored account management capabilities.

### Business Justification
A robust user management system is essential for building customer trust, enabling personalized shopping experiences, and ensuring secure transactions. The system must handle complex scenarios including address management, communication preferences, and security features while maintaining regulatory compliance and data privacy standards.
