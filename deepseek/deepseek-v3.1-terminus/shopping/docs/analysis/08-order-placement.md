# Order Placement System Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive business requirements for the order placement system within the e-commerce shopping mall platform. The order placement process represents the critical transition from shopping intent to binding transaction, requiring robust validation, real-time inventory management, and seamless user experience across all customer scenarios.

### Business Context
Order placement serves as the central transaction engine connecting customers, sellers, and platform operations. The system must handle complex scenarios including multi-seller orders, inventory validation, payment processing, and customer communication while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Core Order Placement Workflow

### Order Initiation Process

**WHEN a customer initiates checkout from their shopping cart, THE system SHALL validate cart contents and customer readiness for purchase.**
