```

### 2.2 Feature Justification
WHEN considering feature inclusion, THE system SHALL prioritize simplicity by including only features that are essential for basic todo functionality, excluding any advanced functionality that would create complexity for beginners.

## 3. Todo Creation Requirements

### 3.1 Basic Todo Creation Process
WHEN a user wants to add a new todo item, THE system SHALL provide an intuitive interface for creating todos with text descriptions.

**Creation Workflow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A["User Clicks Add"] --> B["Show Input Field"]
    B --> C["User Types Text"]
    C --> D{"Validate Input"}
    D -->|"Invalid"| E["Show Error Message"]
    E --> C
    D -->|"Valid"| F["Create Todo Item"]
    F --> G["Assign Unique ID"]
    G --> H["Set Initial State"]
    H --> I["Add to List"]
    I --> J["Update Display"]
```

### 3.2 Todo Text Validation Rules
THE system SHALL implement comprehensive validation to ensure todo text quality and consistency.

**RULE TRV-001: Todo Text Minimum Length**
WHEN a user attempts to create a todo, IF the text contains fewer than 1 character, THEN THE system SHALL display an error message: "Todo text must contain at least 1 character."

**RULE TRV-002: Todo Text Maximum Length**
WHEN a user enters todo text exceeding 500 characters, THEN THE system SHALL automatically truncate the text to 500 characters and display a notification: "Todo text was truncated to 500 characters."

**RULE TRV-003: Whitespace Validation**
IF a user attempts to create a todo containing only whitespace characters, THEN THE system SHALL reject the input and display: "Todo text cannot be empty or contain only spaces."

### 3.3 Automatic Todo Assignment
WHEN a todo is successfully created, THE system SHALL automatically assign it the following properties:
- Status: "incomplete"
- Creation timestamp: Current date and time
- Unique identifier: System-generated unique ID
- Display order: Based on creation sequence

## 4. Todo Management Requirements

### 4.1 Status Management System
WHEN a user interacts with a todo item, THE system SHALL provide clear mechanisms for managing todo status.

**Status Transition Workflow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A["User Views Todo"] --> B["Display Status Indicator"]
    B --> C["User Clicks Toggle"]
    C --> D{"Current Status"}
    D -->|"Incomplete"| E["Mark as Complete"]
    D -->|"Complete"| F["Mark as Incomplete"]
    E --> G["Update Visual Display"]
    F --> G
    G --> H["Persist Changes"]
    H --> I["Confirm Status Update"]
```

### 4.2 Visual Status Indication
WHILE displaying todo items, THE system SHALL provide clear visual differentiation between status states:
- **Incomplete todos**: Normal text display with unchecked checkbox
- **Complete todos**: Strikethrough text with checked checkbox
- **Visual consistency**: Same styling applied to all items in the same state

### 4.3 Todo Deletion Process
WHEN a user wants to remove a todo, THE system SHALL implement a confirmation-based deletion workflow.

**Deletion Workflow:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["User Selects Delete"] --> B["Show Confirmation Dialog"]
    B --> C{"User Confirms"}
    C -->|"Yes"| D["Remove Todo from List"]
    C -->|"No"| E["Cancel Deletion"]
    D --> F["Update Display"]
    E --> G["Return to List"]
    F --> G
```

**RULE TDL-001: Delete Confirmation**
WHEN a user initiates todo deletion, THE system SHALL display a confirmation dialog with the message: "Are you sure you want to delete this todo? This action cannot be undone."

**RULE TDL-002: Deletion Irreversibility**
WHEN a todo is confirmed for deletion, THE system SHALL permanently remove it from the list without providing undo functionality.

## 5. User Interface Requirements

### 5.1 Interface Layout Specifications
THE system SHALL implement a clean, minimal interface with the following components:

**Primary Interface Elements:**
- Header section with application title
