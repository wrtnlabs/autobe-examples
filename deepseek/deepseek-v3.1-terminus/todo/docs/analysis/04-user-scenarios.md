# Todo Application - Comprehensive User Scenarios

## Executive Summary

This document provides detailed user scenarios and interaction flows for the Minimal Todo Application. Each scenario follows the EARS format (Event-Driven, State-Driven, and Ubiquitous requirements) to ensure clear, testable specifications for backend developers.

## User Personas

### 1. Primary User - "Task Manager"
- **Background**: Individual seeking simple task organization
- **Technical Level**: Basic computer literacy, no programming knowledge
- **Goals**: Quick task capture and management without complexity
- **Usage Pattern**: Daily task tracking with 5-20 todos

### 2. Learning User - "Programming Student"
- **Background**: Beginner developer studying application architecture
- **Technical Level**: Basic programming knowledge
- **Goals**: Understand clean code structure and simple CRUD operations
- **Usage Pattern**: Intermittent use for learning purposes

## Primary User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time User Registration and Onboarding

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["User Opens Application"] --> B["Display Welcome Screen"]
    B --> C["Show Registration Form"]
    C --> D["User Enters Email"]
    D --> E["User Creates Password"]
    E --> F{"Validate Input"}
    F -->|"Invalid"| G["Show Error Message"]
    G --> C
    F -->|"Valid"| H["Create User Account"]
    H --> I["Generate JWT Tokens"]
    I --> J["Redirect to Todo Dashboard"]
    J --> K["Display Empty Todo List"]
    K --> L["Show Quick Start Guide"]
```

**EARS Requirements for Registration:**
- WHEN a new user visits the application for the first time, THE system SHALL present a simple registration interface with email and password fields
- WHILE the user is completing the registration form, THE system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
- IF the user attempts to submit invalid registration data, THEN THE system SHALL highlight specific errors and prevent account creation
- AFTER successful registration, THE system SHALL automatically log in the user and redirect to the todo dashboard

### Scenario 2: User Login and Authentication

**Ubiquitous Authentication Requirements:**
- THE system SHALL maintain secure user sessions using JWT tokens with appropriate expiration policies
- THE system SHALL protect against common security vulnerabilities including CSRF and XSS attacks

**Event-Driven Requirements:**
- WHEN a registered user attempts to log in, THE system SHALL validate credentials against stored user data
- IF authentication succeeds, THEN THE system SHALL generate access and refresh tokens and establish a secure session
- IF authentication fails due to invalid credentials, THEN THE system SHALL return a generic error message without revealing whether the email exists
- WHEN a user's access token expires but refresh token is valid, THE system SHALL automatically obtain new tokens without user intervention

### Scenario 3: Todo Creation Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["User Views Dashboard"] --> B["Display Todo Input Field"]
    B --> C["User Types Todo Text"]
    C --> D{"Validate Todo Text"}
    D -->|"Empty/Invalid"| E["Show Validation Error"]
    E --> B
    D -->|"Valid"| F["Create Todo Object"]
    F --> G["Assign Unique ID"]
    G --> H["Set Default Status: Incomplete"]
    H --> I["Record Creation Timestamp"]
    I --> J["Save to Database"]
    J --> K["Update UI Display"]
    K --> L["Clear Input Field"]
    L --> B
```

**State-Driven Requirements:**
- WHILE creating a new todo, THE system SHALL maintain the current todo list state and display it alongside the input interface
- AFTER a todo is successfully created, THE system SHALL immediately update the display to include the new item

**Business Rules for Todo Creation:**
- WHEN creating a todo, THE system SHALL enforce a minimum text length of 1 character and maximum of 500 characters
- IF a user attempts to create a todo with only whitespace characters, THEN THE system SHALL treat it as empty text and reject the creation
- THE system SHALL automatically assign "incomplete" status to all newly created todos

### Scenario 4: Todo Status Management

**Complete/Incomplete Toggle Requirements:**
- WHEN a user clicks on a todo's status toggle, THE system SHALL immediately update the todo's completion status
- AFTER status change, THE system SHALL persist the updated state to the database
- THE system SHALL provide clear visual feedback indicating the current status (e.g., strikethrough for completed items)

**State-Driven Requirements:**
- WHILE a todo is marked as complete, THE system SHALL display it with visual distinction from incomplete items
- WHILE a todo is marked as incomplete, THE system SHALL display it as an active, pending task

### Scenario 5: Todo Deletion Process

```mermaid
graph TB
    A["User Initiates Delete"] --> B["Show Confirmation Dialog"]
    B --> C{"User Confirms Action"}
    C -->|"Cancel"| D["Close Dialog"]
    D --> E["Return to Normal View"]
    C -->|"Confirm"| F["Remove Todo from Database"]
    F --> G["Update UI to Reflect Deletion"]
    G --> H["Show Success Notification"]
    H --> E
```

**Event-Driven Requirements:**
- WHEN a user attempts to delete a todo, THE system SHALL require explicit confirmation to prevent accidental deletion
- IF user confirms deletion, THEN THE system SHALL permanently remove the todo from the database
- IF user cancels deletion, THEN THE system SHALL retain the todo unchanged and return to normal operation

**Ubiquitous Requirements:**
- THE system SHALL not provide an "undo" functionality for deleted todos to maintain simplicity
- THE system SHALL ensure deletion operations are irreversible once confirmed

### Scenario 6: Session Management and Security

**Authentication Flow Requirements:**
- WHEN a user remains inactive for more than 30 minutes, THE system SHALL maintain the session but may require re-authentication for sensitive operations
- IF both access and refresh tokens expire, THEN THE system SHALL redirect the user to the login page
- WHEN a user explicitly logs out, THE system SHALL invalidate all tokens and clear session data

**Security Requirements:**
- THE system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on authentication endpoints
- THE system SHALL validate all input data to prevent injection attacks
- THE system SHALL enforce proper CORS policies for cross-origin requests

## Error Handling Scenarios

### Scenario 7: Authentication Failures

**WHEN authentication services experience technical issues,** THE system SHALL:
- Return HTTP 503 Service Unavailable with appropriate retry-after headers
- Log detailed error information for debugging purposes
- Provide user-friendly error messages without exposing technical details

**IF a user attempts to access protected resources without valid authentication,** THEN THE system SHALL:
- Return HTTP 401 Unauthorized
- Redirect to login page with return URL parameter
- Clear any invalid or expired tokens from client storage

### Scenario 8: Data Persistence Failures

**WHEN the system cannot save todo data to persistent storage,** THE system SHALL:
- Maintain todo data in memory for the current session
- Attempt automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Notify the user of the temporary issue with appropriate messaging
- Provide manual save option if automatic saving fails repeatedly

**IF data loading fails during application startup,** THEN THE system SHALL:
- Start with an empty todo list
- Log the error for debugging
- Provide user notification about data loading failure
- Offer data recovery options if available

### Scenario 9: Input Validation Errors

**WHEN a user submits invalid todo data,** THE system SHALL:
- Provide specific, actionable error messages
- Highlight the problematic input fields
- Maintain entered data to prevent re-entry
- Suggest corrections when possible

**Business Rule Validation Examples:**
- IF todo text exceeds 500 characters, THEN THE system SHALL truncate to 500 characters with user notification
- IF todo text is empty, THEN THE system SHALL prevent submission and highlight the required field
- IF duplicate todo detection is implemented, THEN THE system SHALL warn the user but allow creation

## Performance Scenarios

### Scenario 10: Application Load Performance

**WHEN a user opens the application,** THE system SHALL:
- Load initial interface within 2 seconds on average network conditions
- Display existing todos within 3 seconds of page load
- Provide loading indicators during data retrieval
- Cache frequently accessed data for improved performance

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Todo creation operations SHALL complete within 100ms
- Status toggle operations SHALL complete within 50ms
- Todo deletion operations SHALL complete within 100ms
- List rendering with 100+ items SHALL complete within 500ms

### Scenario 11: Concurrent Operations

**WHILE multiple todo operations are performed rapidly,** THE system SHALL:
- Maintain UI responsiveness during background operations
- Queue operations appropriately to prevent race conditions
- Provide visual feedback for pending operations
- Handle operation conflicts with appropriate resolution strategies

## Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

### Scenario 12: Large Todo Lists

**WHEN the todo list contains 1000+ items,** THE system SHALL:
- Implement efficient data loading with pagination or virtual scrolling
- Maintain responsive user interface during filtering and sorting
- Provide search functionality for quick item location
- Optimize memory usage to prevent browser performance issues

### Scenario 13: Network Connectivity Issues

**WHILE the application operates in offline mode,** THE system SHALL:
- Continue functioning with local data storage
- Queue operations for synchronization when connectivity returns
- Provide clear indication of offline status
- Handle sync conflicts with appropriate resolution

### Scenario 14: Browser Compatibility Issues

**WHEN the application runs on unsupported browsers,** THE system SHALL:
- Provide graceful degradation of functionality
- Display compatibility warnings with suggested alternatives
- Maintain core functionality where possible
- Offer basic HTML fallback for critical operations

## Integration Scenarios

### Scenario 15: Data Flow Between Components

```mermaid
graph TB
    A["User Interface"] --> B["API Layer"]
    B --> C["Business Logic"]
    C --> D["Data Access Layer"]
    D --> E["Database/Persistence"]
    E --> D
    D --> C
