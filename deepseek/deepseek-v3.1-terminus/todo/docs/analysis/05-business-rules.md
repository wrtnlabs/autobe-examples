# Business Rules Documentation - Minimal Todo Application

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the comprehensive business rules and logic constraints that govern the minimal Todo application. The application focuses exclusively on core Todo functionality with no advanced features, providing a simple, straightforward user experience for Todo management.

### Purpose
- Define the complete business logic that controls all todo operations
- Specify comprehensive validation rules and constraints for todo data
- Document complete state management and workflow definitions
- Provide clear, testable criteria for implementation
- Serve as single source of truth for all business rule requirements

### Scope
This document covers the minimum functionality required for a basic Todo application:
- Todo item creation and validation with complete error handling
- Todo state management (complete/incomplete) with persistence rules
- Todo deletion with confirmation workflows and edge cases
- List display and basic operations with performance requirements
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery scenarios

**Excluded from scope**: Categories, due dates, priorities, user accounts, search/filtering, and any advanced functionality.

## 2. Data Validation Rules

### 2.1 Todo Text Content Validation

**WHEN creating a new todo item**, THE system SHALL validate the todo text content according to the following rules:

**RULE TRV-001: Todo Text Minimum Length**
- **IF** todo text is less than 1 character, **THEN** THE system SHALL reject the input and display error message: "Todo must contain at least 1 character"
- **WHILE** validating todo text, THE system SHALL trim leading and trailing whitespace before checking length
- **THE** system SHALL prevent submission until minimum length requirement is met

**RULE TRV-002: Todo Text Maximum Length**
- **WHEN** todo text exceeds 500 characters, **THEN** THE system SHALL automatically truncate to 500 characters
- **THE** system SHALL display warning message: "Todo text truncated to 500 characters"
- **WHILE** user is typing, THE system SHALL show character count (e.g., "245/500")

**RULE TRV-003: Empty Text Prevention**
- **IF** user attempts to create a todo with only whitespace characters, **THEN** THE system SHALL treat it as empty text and apply RULE TRV-001
- **THE** system SHALL provide clear feedback: "Please enter meaningful todo text"

**RULE TRV-004: Special Character Handling**
- **WHILE** accepting todo text, THE system SHALL allow all standard keyboard characters including punctuation
- **THE** system SHALL not impose restrictions on character types for maximum flexibility

### 2.2 Todo State Validation

**RULE TSV-001: Initial State Assignment**
- **WHEN** a new todo is created, **THE** system SHALL automatically assign it an "incomplete" state
- **THE** system SHALL provide clear visual indicators for the current state (e.g., unchecked checkbox for incomplete)

**RULE TSV-002: State Transition Integrity**
- **WHILE** a todo exists, **THE** system SHALL allow only two state transitions: incomplete → complete and complete → incomplete
- **THE** system SHALL prevent any other state modifications or invalid transitions
- **WHEN** state changes occur, THE system SHALL update the modification timestamp

**RULE TSV-003: State Persistence**
- **WHEN** a todo state is changed, **THE** system SHALL immediately persist the new state
- **THE** system SHALL ensure state changes survive application restarts

## 3. Business Logic Constraints

### 3.1 Todo Creation Constraints

**RULE TCC-001: Unique Todo Identification**
- **WHEN** creating a new todo, **THE** system SHALL generate a unique identifier for each todo item
- **THE** system SHALL ensure no duplicate identifiers exist within the same user session
- **IDENTIFIER FORMAT**: UUID v4 or timestamp-based unique ID

**RULE TCC-002: Creation Timestamp**
- **WHEN** a todo is successfully created, **THE** system SHALL record the creation timestamp in ISO 8601 format
- **THE** system SHALL display todos in chronological order (newest first by default)

**RULE TCC-003: Todo Order Preservation**
- **WHILE** displaying todos, **THE** system SHALL maintain the creation order
- **WHEN** new todos are added, **THE** system SHALL insert them according to sort preference
- **THE** system SHALL support basic sorting options: newest first, oldest first

### 3.2 Todo Management Constraints

**RULE TMC-001: State Change Persistence**
- **WHEN** a user marks a todo as complete or incomplete, **THE** system SHALL immediately persist the state change
- **THE** system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the state change
- **VISUAL INDICATORS**: Strikethrough text for completed items, different color schemes

**RULE TMC-002: Todo Deletion Confirmation**
- **WHEN** a user attempts to delete a todo, **THE** system SHALL require explicit confirmation
- **CONFIRMATION DIALOG**: "Are you sure you want to delete this todo?" with Yes/No options
- **IF** user confirms deletion, **THEN** THE system SHALL permanently remove the todo
- **IF** user cancels deletion, **THEN** THE system SHALL retain the todo unchanged

**RULE TMC-003: Deletion Irreversibility**
- **WHEN** a todo is deleted, **THE** system SHALL make the action irreversible
- **THE** system SHALL not provide an "undo" functionality for simplicity
- **THE** system SHALL remove all references to the deleted todo

**RULE TMC-004: Bulk Operations Prevention**
- **THE** system SHALL not support bulk operations (select multiple, delete all completed, etc.)
- **EACH** todo operation SHALL be performed individually to maintain simplicity

### 3.3 List Management Constraints

**RULE LMC-001: Empty List Behavior**
- **WHILE** no todos exist, **THE** system SHALL display a friendly message: "Your todo list is empty. Add your first todo above!"
- **THE** system SHALL provide clear instructions for creating the first todo
- **THE** empty state SHALL include visual cues to guide new users

**RULE LMC-002: List Length Limits**
- **THE** system SHALL not impose artificial limits on the number of todos
- **WHEN** the list grows large, **THE** system SHALL maintain performance and usability
- **PERFORMANCE THRESHOLD**: The system SHALL handle up to 1000 todos without degradation

**RULE LMC-003: List Display Optimization**
- **WHEN** displaying large lists, **THE** system SHALL implement basic virtualization if needed
- **THE** user experience SHALL remain smooth regardless of list size

## 5. Process Flows

### 5.1 Application Startup Process

**WHEN the application starts**, THE system SHALL:
1. Initialize application state and UI components
2. Attempt to load existing todos from persistent storage
3. IF storage loading fails, THEN start with empty list and show recovery message

- Provide recovery mechanisms for corrupted data

**PERSISTENCE STRATEGY**:
- Save after each user action with 500ms debounce
