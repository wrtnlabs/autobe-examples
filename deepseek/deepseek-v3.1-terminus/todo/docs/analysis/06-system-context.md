# Minimal Todo Application - System Context Document

## 1. Comprehensive System Overview

### 1.1 Technical Architecture

The Minimal Todo Application operates as a client-side web application designed for simplicity and immediate usability. The system follows a single-page application (SPA) architecture that runs entirely within the user's web browser.

**WHEN the application loads, THE system SHALL initialize completely within the browser environment** without requiring server-side processing or external dependencies.

- **Application Logic Layer**: Manages todo operations, validation, and business rules
- **Data Persistence Layer**: Handles storage operations using browser APIs
- **Event Handling System**: Processes user interactions and system events
- **State Management**: Maintains application state and synchronization

### 1.3 Technology Stack

**THE system SHALL utilize the following technology stack:**

| Safari | 11+ | localStorage, ES6 support, CSS Grid |
| Edge | 79+ | localStorage, ES6 support, CSS Grid |

**THE system SHALL provide graceful degradation** for unsupported browsers with basic functionality maintained.

### 2.2 Storage Requirements and Limitations

**WHEN storing todo data, THE system SHALL adhere to browser storage limitations:**
- **Maximum Storage**: 5MB per domain (typical browser localStorage limit)

- **Storage Key**: "minimal-todo-app-data" for data persistence
- **Backup Strategy**: Optional export functionality for data backup

### 2.3 Performance Benchmarks

**THE system SHALL meet the following performance thresholds:**

**WHEN loading the application, THE system SHALL:**
- Complete initial load within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections
- Display existing todos within 1 second of application start
- Initialize all interface components within 500 milliseconds

**WHEN performing todo operations, THE system SHALL:**
- Respond to user actions within 100 milliseconds
- Update the user interface immediately after data changes
- Persist data changes within 50 milliseconds of user action

## 3. Performance Requirements (EARS Format)

### 3.1 Application Loading Performance

**WHEN a user accesses the application URL, THE system SHALL display the main interface within 2 seconds** under normal network conditions.

**WHILE the application is loading, THE system SHALL provide visual feedback** indicating the loading progress.

**IF the application fails to load within 5 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL display an appropriate error message** with recovery options.

### 3.2 Todo Operation Performance

**WHEN a user creates a new todo item, THE system SHALL complete the operation within 100 milliseconds** including validation, storage, and UI updates.

**WHEN a user toggles a todo status, THE system SHALL update the state immediately** with visual confirmation within 50 milliseconds.

**WHEN a user deletes a todo item, THE system SHALL remove it from the display** after confirmation within 150 milliseconds.

### 3.3 Data Persistence Performance

**WHILE the application is running, THE system SHALL automatically save changes** to local storage without blocking user interactions.

**THE data persistence operations SHALL complete in the background** without affecting application responsiveness.

**IF data persistence fails, THEN THE system SHALL retain changes in memory** and attempt to save again later.

## 4. Security and Privacy Implementation

### 4.1 Data Protection Mechanisms

**THE system SHALL implement the following security measures:**

**WHEN storing user data, THE system SHALL utilize browser security features** to prevent unauthorized access.

**THE system SHALL NOT transmit any user data** to external servers or third-party services.

**WHEN handling todo data, THE system SHALL enforce content security policies** to prevent script injection attacks.

### 4.2 Privacy Compliance Requirements

**THE system SHALL comply with basic privacy principles:**
- No collection of personal identifiable information
- No tracking or analytics implementation
- No data sharing with external parties
- Clear data ownership by the user

**WHEN a user clears browser data, THE system SHALL respect the user's decision** and remove all application data permanently.

### 4.3 Security Testing Procedures

**BEFORE deployment, THE system SHALL undergo security testing** for common web vulnerabilities including:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention
- Data injection protection
- Local storage security
- Content Security Policy compliance

## 5. Data Lifecycle Management
